In his laboratory, he uses an excellent application program for manipulating matrix expressions, however, he cannot use it outside his laboratory because the software consumes much of resources. He wants to manipulate matrices outside, so he needs a small program similar to the excellent application for his handheld computer. \n\n\nYour job is to provide him a program that computes expressions of matrices.\n\n\nExpressions of matrices are described in a simple language. Its syntax is shown in Table J.1. Note that even a space and a newline have meaningful roles in the syntax.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe start symbol of this syntax is program that is defined as a sequence of assignments in Table J.1. Each assignment has a variable on the left hand side of an equal symbol (\"=\") and an expression of matrices on the right hand side followed by a period and a newline (NL). It denotes an assignment of the value of the expression to the variable. The variable (var in Table J.1) is indicated by an uppercase Roman letter. The value of the expression (expr) is a matrix or a scalar, whose elements are integers. Here, a scalar integer and a 1 \u00d7 1 matrix whose only element is the same integer can be used interchangeably.\n\n\nAn expression is one or more terms connected by \"+\" or \"-\" symbols. A term is one or more factors connected by \"*\" symbol. These operators (\"+\", \"-\", \"*\") are left associative.\n\n\nA factor is either a primary expression (primary) or a \"-\" symbol followed by a factor. This unary operator \"-\" is right associative.\n\n\nThe meaning of operators are the same as those in the ordinary arithmetic on matrices: Denoting matrices by A and B, A + B, A - B, A * B, and -A are defined as the matrix sum, difference, product, and negation. The sizes of A and B should be the same for addition and subtraction. The number of columns of A and the number of rows of B should be the same for multiplication.\n\n\nNote that all the operators +, -, * and unary - represent computations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and negation modulo M = 215 = 32768, respectively. Thus all the values are nonnegative integers between 0 and 32767, inclusive. For example, the result of an expression 2 - 3 should be 32767, instead of -1.\n\n\ninum is a non-negative decimal integer less than M.\n\n\nvar represents the matrix that is assigned to the variable var in the most recent preceding assignment statement of the same variable.\n\n\nmatrix represents a mathematical matrix similar to a 2-dimensional array whose elements are integers. It is denoted by a row-seq with a pair of enclosing square brackets. row-seq represents a sequence of rows, adjacent two of which are separated by a semicolon. row represents a sequence of expressions, adjacent two of which are separated by a space character.\n\n\nFor example, [1 2 3;4 5 6] represents a matrix . The first row has three integers separated by two space characters, i.e. \"1 2 3\". The second row has three integers, i.e. \"4 5 6\". Here, the row-seq consists of the two rows separated by a semicolon. The matrix is denoted by the row-seq with a pair of square brackets.\n\n\nNote that elements of a row may be matrices again. Thus the nested representation of a matrix may appear. The number of rows of the value of each expression of a row should be the same, and the number of columns of the value of each row of a row-seq should be the same.\n\n\nFor example, a matrix represented by\n\n\n             [[1 2 3;4 5 6] [7 8;9 10] [11;12];13 14 15 16 17 18]\n\n\nis  The sizes of matrices should be consistent, as mentioned above, in order to form a well-formed matrix as the result. For example, [[1 2;3 4] [5;6;7];6 7 8] is not consistent since the first row \"[1 2;3 4] [5;6;7]\" has two matrices (2 \u00d7 2 and 3 \u00d7 1) whose numbers of rows are different. [1 2;3 4 5] is not consistent since the number of columns of two rows are different.\n\n\nThe multiplication of 1 \u00d7 1 matrix and m \u00d7 n matrix is well-defined for arbitrary m > 0 and n > 0, since a 1 \u00d7 1 matrices can be regarded as a scalar integer. For example, 2*[1 2;3 4] and [1 2;3 4]*3 represent the products of a scalar and a matrix  and . [2]*[1 2;3 4] and [1 2;3 4]*[3] are also well-defined similarly.\n\n\nAn indexed-primary is a primary expression followed by two expressions as indices. The first index is 1 \u00d7 k integer matrix denoted by (i1 i2 ... ik), and the second index is 1 \u00d7 l integer matrix denoted by (j1 j2 ... jl). The two indices specify the submatrix extracted from the matrix which is the value of the preceding primary expression. The size of the submatrix is k \u00d7 l and whose (a, b)-element is the (ia, jb)-element of the value of the preceding primary expression. The way of indexing is one-origin, i.e., the first element is indexed by 1.\n\n\nFor example, the value of ([1 2;3 4]+[3 0;0 2])([1],[2]) is equal to 2, since the value of its primary expression is a matrix [4 2;3 6], and the first index [1] and the second [2] indicate the (1, 2)-element of the matrix. The same integer may appear twice or more in an index matrix, e.g., the first index matrix of an expression [1 2;3 4]([2 1 1],[2 1]) is [2 1 1], which has two 1's. Its value is .\n\n\nA transposed-primary is a primary expression followed by a single quote symbol (\"'\"), which indicates the transpose operation. The transposed matrix of an m \u00d7 n matrix A = (aij) (i = 1, ..., m and j = 1, ... , n) is the n \u00d7 m matrix B = (bij) (i = 1, ... , n and j = 1, ... , m), where bij = aji. For example, the value of [1 2;3 4]' is .\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of multiple datasets, followed by a line containing a zero. Each dataset has the following format.\n\n\nn\nprogram\n\n\nn is a positive integer, which is followed by a program that is a sequence of single or multiple \nlines each of which is an assignment statement whose syntax is defined in Table J.1. n indicates \nthe number of the assignment statements in the program. All the values of vars are undefined at the beginning of a program.\n\n\nYou can assume the following:\n\n\n 1 \u2264 n \u2264 10,\n the number of characters in a line does not exceed 80 (excluding a newline),\nthere are no syntax errors and semantic errors (e.g., reference of undefined var),\n the number of rows of matrices appearing in the computations does not exceed 100, and\n the number of columns of matrices appearing in the computations does not exceed 100.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each dataset, the value of the expression of each assignment statement of the program should be printed in the same order. All the values should be printed as non-negative integers less than M.\n\n\nWhen the value is an m \u00d7 n matrix A = (aij) (i = 1, ... ,m and j = 1, ... , n), m lines should be printed. In the k-th line (1 \u2264 k \u2264 m), integers of the k-th row, i.e., ak1, ... , akn, should be printed separated by a space.\n\n\nAfter the last value of a dataset is printed, a line containing five minus symbols '-----' should be printed for human readability.\n\n\nThe output should not contain any other extra characters.\n\nSample Input\n\n1\nA=[1 2 3;4 5 6].\n1\nA=[[1 2 3;4 5 6] [7 8;9 10] [11;12];13 14 15 16 17 18].\n3\nB=[3 -2 1;-9 8 7].\nC=([1 2 3;4 5 6]+B)(2,3).\nD=([1 2 3;4 5 6]+B)([1 2],[2 3]).\n5\nA=2*[1 2;-3 4]'.\nB=A([2 1 2],[2 1]).\nA=[1 2;3 4]*3.\nA=[2]*[1 2;3 4].\nA=[1 2;3 4]*[3].\n2\nA=[11 12 13;0 22 23;0 0 33].\nA=[A A';--A''' A].\n2\nA=[1 -1 1;1 1 -1;-1 1 1]*3.\nA=[A -A+-A;-A'([3 2 1],[3 2 1]) -A'].\n1\nA=1([1 1 1],[1 1 1 1]).\n3\nA=[1 2 -3;4 -5 6;-7 8 9].\nB=A([3 1 2],[2 1 3]).\nC=A*B-B*A+-A*-B-B*-A.\n3\nA=[1 2 3 4 5].\nB=A'*A.\nC=B([1 5],[5 1]).\n3\nA=[-11 12 13;21 -22 23;31 32 -33].\nB=[1 0 0;0 1 0;0 0 1].\nC=[(A-B) (A+B)*B (A+B)*(B-A)([1 1 1],[3 2 1]) [1 2 3;2 1 1;-1 2 1]*(A-B)].\n3\nA=[11 12 13;0 22 23;0 0 33].\nB=[1 2].\nC=------A((((B))),B)(B,B)''''''.\n2\nA=1+[2]+[[3]]+[[[4]]]+2*[[[[5]]]]*3.\nB=[(-[([(-A)]+-A)])].\n8\nA=[1 2;3 4].\nB=[A A+[1 1;0 1]*4;A+[1 1;0 1]'*8 A+[1 1;0 1]''*12].\nC=B([1],[1]).\nC=B([1],[1 2 3 4]).\nC=B([1 2 3 4],[1]).\nC=B([2 3],[2 3]).\nA=[1 2;1 2].\nD=(A*-A+-A)'(A'(1,[1 2]),A'(2,[1 2])).\n0\n\nOutput for the Sample Input\n\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n-----\n1 2 3 7 8 11\n4 5 6 9 10 12\n13 14 15 16 17 18\n-----\n3 32766 1\n32759 8 7\n13\n0 4\n13 13\n-----\n2 32762\n4 8\n8 4\n32762 2\n8 4\n3 6\n9 12\n2 4\n6 8\n3 6\n9 12\n-----\n11 12 13\n0 22 23\n0 0 33\n11 12 13 11 0 0\n0 22 23 12 22 0\n0 0 33 13 23 33\n11 0 0 11 12 13\n12 22 0 0 22 23\n13 23 33 0 0 33\n-----\n3 32765 3\n3 3 32765\n32765 3 3\n3 32765 3 32762 6 32762\n3 3 32765 32762 32762 6\n32765 3 3 6 32762 32762\n32765 3 32765 32765 32765 3\n32765 32765 3 3 32765 32765\n3 32765 32765 32765 3 32765\n-----\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n-----\n1 2 32765\n4 32763 6\n32761 8 9\n8 32761 9\n2 1 32765\n32763 4 6\n54 32734 32738\n32752 32750 174\n32598 186 32702\n-----\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n2 4 6 8 10\n3 6 9 12 15\n4 8 12 16 20\n5 10 15 20 25\n5 1\n25 5\n-----\n32757 12 13\n21 32746 23\n31 32 32735\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n32756 12 13 32758 12 13 32573 32588 180 123 62 32725\n21 32745 23 21 32747 23 32469 32492 276 28 33 15\n31 32 32734 31 32 32736 32365 32396 372 85 32742 32767\n-----\n11 12 13\n0 22 23\n0 0 33\n1 2\n11 12\n0 22\n-----\n40\n80\n-----\n1 2\n3 4\n1 2 5 6\n3 4 3 8\n9 2 13 14\n11 12 3 16\n1\n1 2 5 6\n1\n3\n9\n11\n4 3\n2 13\n1 2\n1 2\n32764 32764\n32764 32764\n-----"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The first index is 1 \u00d7 k integer matrix denoted by (i1 i2 ... ik), and the second index is 1 \u00d7 l integer matrix denoted by (j1 j2 ... jl). The two indices specify the submatrix extracted from the matrix which is the value of the preceding primary expression. The size of the submatrix is k \u00d7 l and whose (a, b)-element is the (ia, jb)-element of the value of the preceding primary expression. The way of indexing is one-origin, i.e., the first element is indexed by 1.\n\n\nFor example, the value of ([1 2;3 4]+[3 0;0 2])([1],[2]) is equal to 2, since the value of its primary expression is a matrix [4 2;3 6], and the first index [1] and the second [2] indicate the (1, 2)-element of the matrix. The same integer may appear twice or more in an index matrix, e.g., the first index matrix of an expression [1 2;3 4]([2 1 1],[2 1]) is [2 1 1], which has two 1's. Its value is .\n\n\nA transposed-primary is a primary expression followed by a single quote symbol (\"'\"), which indicates the transpose operation. The transposed matrix of an m \u00d7 n matrix A = (aij) (i = 1, ..., m and j = 1, ... , n) is the n \u00d7 m matrix B = (bij) (i = 1, ... , n and j = 1, ... , m), where bij = aji. For example, the value of [1 2;3 4]' is .\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of multiple datasets, followed by a line containing a zero. Each dataset has the following format.\n\n\nn\nprogram\n\n\nn is a positive integer, which is followed by a program that is a sequence of single or multiple \nlines each of which is an assignment statement whose syntax is defined in Table J.1. n indicates \nthe number of the assignment statements in the program. All the values of vars are undefined at the beginning of a program.\n\n\nYou can assume the following:\n\n\n 1 \u2264 n \u2264 10,\n the number of characters in a line does not exceed 80 (excluding a newline),\nthere are no syntax errors and semantic errors (e.g., reference of undefined var),\n the number of rows of matrices appearing in the computations does not exceed 100, and\n the number of columns of matrices appearing in the computations does not exceed 100.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each dataset, the value of the expression of each assignment statement of the program should be printed in the same order. All the values should be printed as non-negative integers less than M.\n\n\nWhen the value is an m \u00d7 n matrix A = (aij) (i = 1, ... ,m and j = 1, ... , n), m lines should be printed. In the k-th line (1 \u2264 k \u2264 m), integers of the k-th row, i.e., ak1, ... , akn, should be printed separated by a space.\n\n\nAfter the last value of a dataset is printed, a line containing five minus symbols '-----' should be printed for human readability.\n\n\nThe output should not contain any other extra characters.\n\nSample Input\n\n1\nA=[1 2 3;4 5 6].\n1\nA=[[1 2 3;4 5 6] [7 8;9 10] [11;12];13 14 15 16 17 18].\n3\nB=[3 -2 1;-9 8 7].\nC=([1 2 3;4 5 6]+B)(2,3).\nD=([1 2 3;4 5 6]+B)([1 2],[2 3]).\n5\nA=2*[1 2;-3 4]'.\nB=A([2 1 2],[2 1]).\nA=[1 2;3 4]*3.\nA=[2]*[1 2;3 4].\nA=[1 2;3 4]*[3].\n2\nA=[11 12 13;0 22 23;0 0 33].\nA=[A A';--A''' A].\n2\nA=[1 -1 1;1 1 -1;-1 1 1]*3.\nA=[A -A+-A;-A'([3 2 1],[3 2 1]) -A'].\n1\nA=1([1 1 1],[1 1 1 1]).\n3\nA=[1 2 -3;4 -5 6;-7 8 9].\nB=A([3 1 2],[2 1 3]).\nC=A*B-B*A+-A*-B-B*-A.\n3\nA=[1 2 3 4 5].\nB=A'*A.\nC=B([1 5],[5 1]).\n3\nA=[-11 12 13;21 -22 23;31 32 -33].\nB=[1 0 0;0 1 0;0 0 1].\nC=[(A-B) (A+B)*B (A+B)*(B-A)([1 1 1],[3 2 1]) [1 2 3;2 1 1;-1 2 1]*(A-B)].\n3\nA=[11 12 13;0 22 23;0 0 33].\nB=[1 2].\nC=------A((((B))),B)(B,B)''''''.\n2\nA=1+[2]+[[3]]+[[[4]]]+2*[[[[5]]]]*3.\nB=[(-[([(-A)]+-A)])].\n8\nA=[1 2;3 4].\nB=[A A+[1 1;0 1]*4;A+[1 1;0 1]'*8 A+[1 1;0 1]''*12].\nC=B([1],[1]).\nC=B([1],[1 2 3 4]).\nC=B([1 2 3 4],[1]).\nC=B([2 3],[2 3]).\nA=[1 2;1 2].\nD=(A*-A+-A)'(A'(1,[1 2]),A'(2,[1 2])).\n0\n\nOutput for the Sample Input\n\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n-----\n1 2 3 7 8 11\n4 5 6 9 10 12\n13 14 15 16 17 18\n-----\n3 32766 1\n32759 8 7\n13\n0 4\n13 13\n-----\n2 32762\n4 8\n8 4\n32762 2\n8 4\n3 6\n9 12\n2 4\n6 8\n3 6\n9 12\n-----\n11 12 13\n0 22 23\n0 0 33\n11 12 13 11 0 0\n0 22 23 12 22 0\n0 0 33 13 23 33\n11 0 0 11 12 13\n12 22 0 0 22 23\n13 23 33 0 0 33\n-----\n3 32765 3\n3 3 32765\n32765 3 3\n3 32765 3 32762 6 32762\n3 3 32765 32762 32762 6\n32765 3 3 6 32762 32762\n32765 3 32765 32765 32765 3\n32765 32765 3 3 32765 32765\n3 32765 32765 32765 3 32765\n-----\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n-----\n1 2 32765\n4 32763 6\n32761 8 9\n8 32761 9\n2 1 32765\n32763 4 6\n54 32734 32738\n32752 32750 174\n32598 186 32702\n-----\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n2 4 6 8 10\n3 6 9 12 15\n4 8 12 16 20\n5 10 15 20 25\n5 1\n25 5\n-----\n32757 12 13\n21 32746 23\n31 32 32735\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n32756 12 13 32758 12 13 32573 32588 180 123 62 32725\n21 32745 23 21 32747 23 32469 32492 276 28 33 15\n31 32 32734 31 32 32736 32365 32396 372 85 32742 32767\n-----\n11 12 13\n0 22 23\n0 0 33\n1 2\n11 12\n0 22\n-----\n40\n80\n-----\n1 2\n3 4\n1 2 5 6\n3 4 3 8\n9 2 13 14\n11 12 3 16\n1\n1 2 5 6\n1\n3\n9\n11\n4 3\n2 13\n1 2\n1 2\n32764 32764\n32764 32764\n-----"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Its syntax is shown in Table J.1. Note that even a space and a newline have meaningful roles in the syntax.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe start symbol of this syntax is program that is defined as a sequence of assignments in Table J.1. Each assignment has a variable on the left hand side of an equal symbol (\"=\") and an expression of matrices on the right hand side followed by a period and a newline (NL). It denotes an assignment of the value of the expression to the variable. The variable (var in Table J.1) is indicated by an uppercase Roman letter. The value of the expression (expr) is a matrix or a scalar, whose elements are integers. Here, a scalar integer and a 1 \u00d7 1 matrix whose only element is the same integer can be used interchangeably.\n\n\nAn expression is one or more terms connected by \"+\" or \"-\" symbols. A term is one or more factors connected by \"*\" symbol. These operators (\"+\", \"-\", \"*\") are left associative.\n\n\nA factor is either a primary expression (primary) or a \"-\" symbol followed by a factor. This unary operator \"-\" is right associative.\n\n\nThe meaning of operators are the same as those in the ordinary arithmetic on matrices: Denoting matrices by A and B, A + B, A - B, A * B, and -A are defined as the matrix sum, difference, product, and negation. The sizes of A and B should be the same for addition and subtraction. The number of columns of A and the number of rows of B should be the same for multiplication.\n\n\nNote that all the operators +, -, * and unary - represent computations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and negation modulo M = 215 = 32768, respectively. Thus all the values are nonnegative integers between 0 and 32767, inclusive. For example, the result of an expression 2 - 3 should be 32767, instead of -1.\n\n\ninum is a non-negative decimal integer less than M.\n\n\nvar represents the matrix that is assigned to the variable var in the most recent preceding assignment statement of the same variable.\n\n\nmatrix represents a mathematical matrix similar to a 2-dimensional array whose elements are integers. It is denoted by a row-seq with a pair of enclosing square brackets. row-seq represents a sequence of rows, adjacent two of which are separated by a semicolon. row represents a sequence of expressions, adjacent two of which are separated by a space character.\n\n\nFor example, [1 2 3;4 5 6] represents a matrix . The first row has three integers separated by two space characters, i.e. \"1 2 3\". The second row has three integers, i.e. \"4 5 6\". Here, the row-seq consists of the two rows separated by a semicolon. The matrix is denoted by the row-seq with a pair of square brackets.\n\n\nNote that elements of a row may be matrices again. Thus the nested representation of a matrix may appear. The number of rows of the value of each expression of a row should be the same, and the number of columns of the value of each row of a row-seq should be the same.\n\n\nFor example, a matrix represented by\n\n\n             [[1 2 3;4 5 6] [7 8;9 10] [11;12];13 14 15 16 17 18]\n\n\nis  The sizes of matrices should be consistent, as mentioned above, in order to form a well-formed matrix as the result. For example, [[1 2;3 4] [5;6;7];6 7 8] is not consistent since the first row \"[1 2;3 4] [5;6;7]\" has two matrices (2 \u00d7 2 and 3 \u00d7 1) whose numbers of rows are different. [1 2;3 4 5] is not consistent since the number of columns of two rows are different.\n\n\nThe multiplication of 1 \u00d7 1 matrix and m \u00d7 n matrix is well-defined for arbitrary m > 0 and n > 0, since a 1 \u00d7 1 matrices can be regarded as a scalar integer. For example, 2*[1 2;3 4] and [1 2;3 4]*3 represent the products of a scalar and a matrix  and . [2]*[1 2;3 4] and [1 2;3 4]*[3] are also well-defined similarly.\n\n\nAn indexed-primary is a primary expression followed by two expressions as indices. The first index is 1 \u00d7 k integer matrix denoted by (i1 i2 ... ik), and the second index is 1 \u00d7 l integer matrix denoted by (j1 j2 ... jl). The two indices specify the submatrix extracted from the matrix which is the value of the preceding primary expression. The size of the submatrix is k \u00d7 l and whose (a, b)-element is the (ia, jb)-element of the value of the preceding primary expression.

Here, the row-seq consists of the two rows separated by a semicolon. The matrix is denoted by the row-seq with a pair of square brackets.\n\n\nNote that elements of a row may be matrices again. Thus the nested representation of a matrix may appear. The number of rows of the value of each expression of a row should be the same, and the number of columns of the value of each row of a row-seq should be the same.\n\n\nFor example, a matrix represented by\n\n\n             [[1 2 3;4 5 6] [7 8;9 10] [11;12];13 14 15 16 17 18]\n\n\nis  The sizes of matrices should be consistent, as mentioned above, in order to form a well-formed matrix as the result. For example, [[1 2;3 4] [5;6;7];6 7 8] is not consistent since the first row \"[1 2;3 4] [5;6;7]\" has two matrices (2 \u00d7 2 and 3 \u00d7 1) whose numbers of rows are different. [1 2;3 4 5] is not consistent since the number of columns of two rows are different.\n\n\nThe multiplication of 1 \u00d7 1 matrix and m \u00d7 n matrix is well-defined for arbitrary m > 0 and n > 0, since a 1 \u00d7 1 matrices can be regarded as a scalar integer. For example, 2*[1 2;3 4] and [1 2;3 4]*3 represent the products of a scalar and a matrix  and . [2]*[1 2;3 4] and [1 2;3 4]*[3] are also well-defined similarly.\n\n\nAn indexed-primary is a primary expression followed by two expressions as indices. The first index is 1 \u00d7 k integer matrix denoted by (i1 i2 ... ik), and the second index is 1 \u00d7 l integer matrix denoted by (j1 j2 ... jl). The two indices specify the submatrix extracted from the matrix which is the value of the preceding primary expression. The size of the submatrix is k \u00d7 l and whose (a, b)-element is the (ia, jb)-element of the value of the preceding primary expression. The way of indexing is one-origin, i.e., the first element is indexed by 1.\n\n\nFor example, the value of ([1 2;3 4]+[3 0;0 2])([1],[2]) is equal to 2, since the value of its primary expression is a matrix [4 2;3 6], and the first index [1] and the second [2] indicate the (1, 2)-element of the matrix. The same integer may appear twice or more in an index matrix, e.g., the first index matrix of an expression [1 2;3 4]([2 1 1],[2 1]) is [2 1 1], which has two 1's. Its value is .\n\n\nA transposed-primary is a primary expression followed by a single quote symbol (\"'\"), which indicates the transpose operation. The transposed matrix of an m \u00d7 n matrix A = (aij) (i = 1, ..., m and j = 1, ... , n) is the n \u00d7 m matrix B = (bij) (i = 1, ... , n and j = 1, ... , m), where bij = aji. For example, the value of [1 2;3 4]' is .\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of multiple datasets, followed by a line containing a zero. Each dataset has the following format.\n\n\nn\nprogram\n\n\nn is a positive integer, which is followed by a program that is a sequence of single or multiple \nlines each of which is an assignment statement whose syntax is defined in Table J.1. n indicates \nthe number of the assignment statements in the program. All the values of vars are undefined at the beginning of a program.\n\n\nYou can assume the following:\n\n\n 1 \u2264 n \u2264 10,\n the number of characters in a line does not exceed 80 (excluding a newline),\nthere are no syntax errors and semantic errors (e.g., reference of undefined var),\n the number of rows of matrices appearing in the computations does not exceed 100, and\n the number of columns of matrices appearing in the computations does not exceed 100.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each dataset, the value of the expression of each assignment statement of the program should be printed in the same order. All the values should be printed as non-negative integers less than M.\n\n\nWhen the value is an m \u00d7 n matrix A = (aij) (i = 1, ... ,m and j = 1, ... , n), m lines should be printed. In the k-th line (1 \u2264 k \u2264 m), integers of the k-th row, i.e., ak1, ... , akn, should be printed separated by a space.\n\n\nAfter the last value of a dataset is printed, a line containing five minus symbols '-----' should be printed for human readability.\n\n\nThe output should not contain any other extra characters.\n\nSample Input\n\n1\nA=[1 2 3;4 5 6].\n1\nA=[[1 2 3;4 5 6] [7 8;9 10] [11;12];13 14 15 16 17 18].\n3\nB=[3 -2 1;-9 8 7].\nC=([1 2 3;4 5 6]+B)(2,3).\nD=([1 2 3;4 5 6]+B)([1 2],[2 3]).\n5\nA=2*[1 2;-3 4]'.\nB=A([2 1 2],[2 1]).\nA=[1 2;3 4]*3.\nA=[2]*[1 2;3 4].\nA=[1 2;3 4]*[3].\n2\nA=[11 12 13;0 22 23;0 0 33].\nA=[A A';--A''' A].\n2\nA=[1 -1 1;1 1 -1;-1 1 1]*3.\nA=[A -A+-A;-A'([3 2 1],[3 2 1]) -A'].\n1\nA=1([1 1 1],[1 1 1 1]).\n3\nA=[1 2 -3;4 -5 6;-7 8 9].\nB=A([3 1 2],[2 1 3]).\nC=A*B-B*A+-A*-B-B*-A.\n3\nA=[1 2 3 4 5].\nB=A'*A.\nC=B([1 5],[5 1]).\n3\nA=[-11 12 13;21 -22 23;31 32 -33].\nB=[1 0 0;0 1 0;0 0 1].\nC=[(A-B) (A+B)*B (A+B)*(B-A)([1 1 1],[3 2 1]) [1 2 3;2 1 1;-1 2 1]*(A-B)].\n3\nA=[11 12 13;0 22 23;0 0 33].\nB=[1 2].\nC=------A((((B))),B)(B,B)''''''.\n2\nA=1+[2]+[[3]]+[[[4]]]+2*[[[[5]]]]*3.\nB=[(-[([(-A)]+-A)])].\n8\nA=[1 2;3 4].\nB=[A A+[1 1;0 1]*4;A+[1 1;0 1]'*8 A+[1 1;0 1]''*12].\nC=B([1],[1]).\nC=B([1],[1 2 3 4]).\nC=B([1 2 3 4],[1]).\nC=B([2 3],[2 3]).\nA=[1 2;1 2].\nD=(A*-A+-A)'(A'(1,[1 2]),A'(2,[1 2])).\n0\n\nOutput for the Sample Input\n\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n-----\n1 2 3 7 8 11\n4 5 6 9 10 12\n13 14 15 16 17 18\n-----\n3 32766 1\n32759 8 7\n13\n0 4\n13 13\n-----\n2 32762\n4 8\n8 4\n32762 2\n8 4\n3 6\n9 12\n2 4\n6 8\n3 6\n9 12\n-----\n11 12 13\n0 22 23\n0 0 33\n11 12 13 11 0 0\n0 22 23 12 22 0\n0 0 33 13 23 33\n11 0 0 11 12 13\n12 22 0 0 22 23\n13 23 33 0 0 33\n-----\n3 32765 3\n3 3 32765\n32765 3 3\n3 32765 3 32762 6 32762\n3 3 32765 32762 32762 6\n32765 3 3 6 32762 32762\n32765 3 32765 32765 32765 3\n32765 32765 3 3 32765 32765\n3 32765 32765 32765 3 32765\n-----\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n-----\n1 2 32765\n4 32763 6\n32761 8 9\n8 32761 9\n2 1 32765\n32763 4 6\n54 32734 32738\n32752 32750 174\n32598 186 32702\n-----\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n2 4 6 8 10\n3 6 9 12 15\n4 8 12 16 20\n5 10 15 20 25\n5 1\n25 5\n-----\n32757 12 13\n21 32746 23\n31 32 32735\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n32756 12 13 32758 12 13 32573 32588 180 123 62 32725\n21 32745 23 21 32747 23 32469 32492 276 28 33 15\n31 32 32734 31 32 32736 32365 32396 372 85 32742 32767\n-----\n11 12 13\n0 22 23\n0 0 33\n1 2\n11 12\n0 22\n-----\n40\n80\n-----\n1 2\n3 4\n1 2 5 6\n3 4 3 8\n9 2 13 14\n11 12 3 16\n1\n1 2 5 6\n1\n3\n9\n11\n4 3\n2 13\n1 2\n1 2\n32764 32764\n32764 32764\n-----"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The logbook also records her visits at the altar.\n\n\nThe altar attracts programmers from all over the world because one visitor is chosen every\nyear and endowed with a gift of miracle programming power by the goddess. The endowed\nprogrammer is chosen from those programmers who spent the longest time at the altar during\nthe goddess's presence. There have been enthusiastic visitors who spent very long time at the\naltar but failed to receive the gift because the goddess was absent during their visits.\n\n\nNow, your mission is to write a program that finds how long the programmer to be endowed\nstayed at the altar during the goddess's presence.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is a sequence of datasets. The number of datasets is less than 100. Each dataset is\nformatted as follows.\n\n\nn\nM1/D1 h1:m1e1 p1\nM2/D2 h2:m2e2 p2\n.\n.\n.\nMn/Dn hn:mnen pn\n\n\nThe first line of a dataset contains a positive even integer, n \u2264 1000, which denotes the number\nof lines of the logbook. This line is followed by n lines of space-separated data, where Mi/Di\nidentifies the month and the day of the visit, hi:mi represents the time of either the entrance\nto or exit from the altar, ei is either I for entrance, or O for exit, and pi identifies the visitor.\n\n\nAll the lines in the logbook are formatted in a fixed-column format. Both the month and the\nday in the month are represented by two digits. Therefore April 1 is represented by 04/01 and\nnot by 4/1. The time is described in the 24-hour system, taking two digits for the hour, followed\nby a colon and two digits for minutes, 09:13 for instance and not like 9:13. A programmer is\nidentified by an ID, a unique number using three digits. The same format is used to indicate\nentrance and exit of the goddess, whose ID is 000.\n\n\nAll the lines in the logbook are sorted in ascending order with respect to date and time. Because\nthe altar is closed at midnight, the altar is emptied at 00:00. You may assume that each time\nin the input is between 00:01 and 23:59, inclusive.\n\n\nA programmer may leave the altar just after entering it. In this case, the entrance and exit\ntime are the same and the length of such a visit is considered 0 minute. You may assume for\nsuch entrance and exit records, the line that corresponds to the entrance appears earlier in the\ninput than the line that corresponds to the exit. You may assume that at least one programmer\nappears in the logbook.\n\n\nThe end of the input is indicated by a line containing a single zero.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each dataset, output the total sum of the blessed time of the endowed programmer. The\nblessed time of a programmer is the length of his/her stay at the altar during the presence of\nthe goddess. The endowed programmer is the one whose total blessed time is the longest among\nall the programmers. The output should be represented in minutes.

(Two square sequences can share some squares.)\nThe square sequences start from different squares, and/or go to different directions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure B.1: The Sorcerer's Donut Before\nFilled with Letters, Showing the Mesh and 8\nPossible Spell Directions \n\n\n\nFigure B.2: The Sorcerer's Donut After Filled\nwith Letters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that a palindrome (i.e., a string that is the same whether you read it backwards or forwards)\nthat satisfies the first condition \"appears\" twice.\n\n\nThe pattern on the donut is given as a matrix of letters as follows.\n\n\nABCD\nEFGH\nIJKL\n\n\nNote that the surface of the donut has no ends; the top and bottom sides, and the left and right\nsides of the pattern are respectively connected. There can be square sequences longer than both\nthe vertical and horizontal lengths of the pattern. For example, from the letter F in the above\npattern, the strings in the longest non-self-overlapping sequences towards the 8 directions are\nas follows.\n\n\nFGHE\nFKDEJCHIBGLA\nFJB\nFIDGJAHKBELC\nFEHG\nFALGBIHCJEDK\nFBJ\nFCLEBKHAJGDI\n\n\nPlease write a program that finds the magic spell before you will be choked with pieces of donuts\ndough.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is a sequence of datasets. Each dataset begins with a line of two integers h and w,\nwhich denote the size of the pattern, followed by h lines of w uppercase letters from A to Z,\ninclusive, which denote the pattern on the donut. You may assume 3 \u2264 h \u2264 10 and 3 \u2264 w \u2264 20.\n\n\nThe end of the input is indicated by a line containing two zeros.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each dataset, output the magic spell.

They immediately sent their president's letter to the Institute of Science\nand Education of the Commonwealth Galactica claiming that authoritative academic inspections\nwere to be completed before any commercial exploitation might damage the nature.\n\n\nFortunately, astrogeologists do not plan to practice all the possible inspections on all of the\ntrigons; there are far too many of them. Inspections are planned only on some characteristic\ntrigons and, for each of them, in one of twenty different scientific aspects.\n\n\nTo accelerate building this new tourist resort, ITO's construction machinery team has already succeeded in putting their brand-new\ninvention in practical use. It is a rover vehicle of the shape of an icosahedron, a regular polyhedron with twenty faces of equilateral triangles. \nThe machine is customized\nso that each of the twenty faces exactly fits each of the trigons. \nControlling the high-tech gyromotor installed inside its body, the rover can roll onto one of the three trigons neighboring the one its bottom is\non.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure E.1: The Rover on Mare Triangularis\n\n\n\n\n\nEach of the twenty faces has its own function. The set of equipments installed on the bottom\nface touching the ground can be applied to the trigon it is on. Of course, the rover was meant to accelerate construction of the luxury hotels to host rich interstellar travelers, but, changing\nthe installed equipment sets, it can also be used to accelerate academic inspections.\n\n\nYou are the driver of this rover and are asked to move the vehicle onto the trigon specified by\nthe leader of the scientific commission with the smallest possible steps. What makes your task\nmore difficult is that the designated face installed with the appropriate set of equipments has to\nbe the bottom. The direction of the rover does not matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure E.2:The Coordinate System \n\n\n\nFigure E.3: Face Numbering\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trigons of Mare Triangularis are given two-dimensional coordinates as shown in Figure E.2.\nLike maps used for the Earth, the x axis is from the west to the east, and the y axis is from the\nsouth to the north. Note that all the trigons with its coordinates (x , y) has neighboring trigons\nwith coordinates (x - 1 , y) and (x + 1 , y). In addition to these, when x + y is even, it has a\nneighbor (x , y + 1); otherwise, that is, when x + y is odd, it has a neighbor (x , y - 1).\n\n\nFigure E.3 shows a development of the skin of the rover. The top face of the development\nmakes the exterior. That is, if the numbers on faces of the development were actually marked\non the faces of the rover, they should been readable from its outside. These numbers are used\nto identify the faces.\n\n\nWhen you start the rover, it is on the trigon (0,0) and the face 0 is touching the ground. The\nrover is placed so that rolling towards north onto the trigon (0,1) makes the face numbered 5\nto be at the bottom.\n\n\nAs your first step, you can choose one of the three adjacent trigons, namely those with coordinates (-1,0), (1,0), \nand (0,1), to visit. The bottom will be the face numbered 4, 1, and 5,\nrespectively. If you choose to go to (1,0) in the first rolling step, the second step can bring\nthe rover to either of (0,0), (2,0), or (1,-1). The bottom face will be either of 0, 6, or 2,\ncorrespondingly. The rover may visit any of the trigons twice or more, including the start and the goal trigons, when appropriate.\n\n\nThe theoretical design section of ITO showed that the rover can reach any goal trigon on the\nspecified bottom face within a finite number of steps.\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of a number of datasets. The number of datasets does not exceed 50.\n\n\nEach of the datasets has three integers x, y, and n in one line, separated by a space. Here, (x,y)\nspecifies the coordinates of the trigon to which you have to move the rover, and n specifies the\nface that should be at the bottom.\n\n\nThe end of the input is indicated by a line containing three zeros.\n\nOutput\n\nThe output for each dataset should be a line containing a single integer that gives the minimum\nnumber of steps required to set the rover on the specified trigon with the specified face touching\nthe ground. No other characters should appear in the output.\n\n\nYou can assume that the maximum number of required steps does not exceed 100. Mare Triangularis\n is broad enough so that any of its edges cannot be reached within that number of\nsteps.\n\nSample Input\n\n0 0 1\n3 5 2\n-4 1 3\n13 -13 2\n-32 15 9\n-50 50 0\n0 0 0\n\nOutput for the Sample Input\n\n6\n10\n9\n30\n47\n100"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Let us consider the following mathematical expression.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is printed in the following four lines:\n\n\n        4   2\n( 1 - ---- )  * - 5 + 6\n        2\n       3\n\n\nwhere \u201c- 5\u201d indicates unary minus followed by 5. We call such an expression of lines \u201cASCII expression\u201d.\n\n\nFor helping those who want to evaluate ASCII expressions obtained through optical character recognition (OCR) from old papers, your job is to write a program that recognizes the structure of ASCII expressions and computes their values.\n\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, you may assume that ASCII expressions are constructed by the following rules. Its syntax is shown in Table H.1.\n\n\n\n(1)\nTerminal symbols are \u20180\u2019,  \u20181\u2019,  \u20182\u2019,  \u20183\u2019,  \u20184\u2019,  \u20185\u2019,  \u20186\u2019,  \u20187\u2019,  \u20188\u2019,  \u20189\u2019,  \u2018+\u2019,  \u2018-\u2019,  \u2018*\u2019,  \u2018(\u2019,  \u2018)\u2019, and  \u2018\u00a0\u2019.\n\n\n(2)\nNonterminal symbols are expr, term, factor, powexpr, primary, fraction and digit. The start symbol is expr.\n\n\n(3)\nA \u201ccell\u201d is a rectangular region of characters that corresponds to a terminal or nonterminal symbol (Figure H.1). In the cell, there are no redundant rows and columns that consist only of space characters. A cell corresponding to a terminal symbol consists of a single character. A cell corresponding to a nonterminal symbol contains cell(s) corresponding to its descendant(s) but never partially overlaps others.\n\n\n(4)\nEach cell has a base-line, a top-line, and a bottom-line. The base-lines of child cells of the right-hand side of rules I, II, III, and V should be aligned. Their vertical position defines the base-line position of their left-hand side cell.\nTable H.1: Rules for constructing ASCII expressions (similar to Backus-Naur Form) The box indicates the cell of the terminal or nonterminal symbol that corresponds to a rectan- gular region of characters. Note that each syntactically-needed space character is explicitly\nindicated by the period character denoted by, here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(5)\npowexpr consists of a primary and an optional digit. The digit is placed one line above the base-line of the primary cell. They are horizontally adjacent to each other. The base-line of a powexpr is that of the primary.\n\n\n(6)\nfraction is indicated by three or more consecutive hyphens called \u201cvinculum\u201d. Its dividend expr is placed just above the vinculum, and its divisor expr is placed just beneath it. The number of the hyphens of the vinculum, denoted by wh, is equal to 2 + max(w1, w2), where w1 and w2 indicate the width of the cell of the dividend and that of the divisor, respectively. These cells are centered, where there are \u2308(wh\u2212wk)/2\u2309 space characters to the left and \u230a(wh\u2212wk)/2\u230b space characters to the right, (k = 1, 2). The base-line of a fraction is at the position of the vinculum.\n\n(7)\ndigit consists of one character.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the negative fraction is represented in three lines:\n\n   3\n- ---\n   4\nwhere the left-most hyphen means a unary minus operator. One space character is required between the unary minus and the vinculum of the fraction.\nThe fraction  is represented in four lines:\n\n 3 + 4 * - 2\n-------------\n          2\n   - 1 - 2\n\n\nwhere the widths of the cells of the dividend and divisor are 11 and 8 respectively. Hence the number of hyphens of the vinculum is 2 + max(11, 8) = 13. The divisor is centered by \u2308(13\u22128)/2\u2309 = 3 space characters (hyphens) to the left and \u230a(13\u22128)/2\u230b = 2 to the right.\n\n\nThe powexpr (42)3 is represented in two lines:\n\n\n   2  3\n( 4  )\n\n\nwhere the cell for 2 is placed one line above the base-line of the cell for 4, and the cell for 3 is placed one line above the base-line of the cell for a primary (42).\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of multiple datasets, followed by a line containing a zero. Each dataset has the following format.\n\n\nn\nstr1\nstr2\n.\n.\n.\nstrn\n\n\nn is a positive integer, which indicates the number of the following lines with the same length that represent the cell of an ASCII expression. strk is the k-th line of the cell where each space character is replaced with a period.\n\n\nYou may assume that n \u2264 20 and that the length of the lines is no more than 80.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each dataset, one line containing a non-negative integer less than 2011 should be output. The integer indicates the value of the ASCII expression in modular arithmetic under modulo 2011. The output should not contain any other characters.\n\n\nThere is no fraction with the divisor that is equal to zero or a multiple of 2011.\n\n\nNote that powexpr x0 is defined as 1, and xy (y is a positive integer) is defined as the product x\u00d7x\u00d7...\u00d7x where the number of x's is equal to y.\n\n\nA fractionis computed as the multiplication of x and the inverse of y, i.e., x\u00d7 inv(y), under y modulo 2011. The inverse of y (1 \u2264 y < 2011) is uniquely defined as the integer z (1 \u2264 z < 2011) that satisfies z \u00d7 y \u2261 1 (mod 2011), since 2011 is a prime number.\n\nSample Input\n\n4\n........4...2..........\n(.1.-.----.)..*.-.5.+.6\n........2..............\n.......3...............\n3\n...3.\n-.---\n...4.\n4\n.3.+.4.*.-.2.\n-------------\n..........2..\n...-.1.-.2...\n2\n...2..3\n(.4..).\n1\n2.+.3.*.5.-.7.+.9\n1\n(.2.+.3.).*.(.5.-.7.).+.9\n3\n.2....3.\n4..+.---\n......5.\n3\n.2......-.-.3.\n4..-.-.-------\n..........5...\n9\n............1............\n-------------------------\n..............1..........\n.1.+.-------------------.\n................1........\n......1.+.-------------..\n..................1......\n...........1.+.-------...\n................1.+.2....\n15\n.................2......\n................---.....\n.......2.........5....3.\n.(.---------.+.-----.)..\n.....7...........3......\n....---.+.1.............\n.....4..................\n------------------------\n.......2................\n......---...............\n.......5.......2....2...\n...(.-----.+.-----.)....\n.......3.......3........\n..............---.......\n...............4........\n2\n.0....2....\n3..+.4..*.5\n20\n............2............................2......................................\n...........3............................3.......................................\n..........----.........................----.....................................\n............4............................4......................................\n.....2.+.------.+.1...............2.+.------.+.1................................\n............2............................2......................................\n...........2............................2........................2..............\n..........----.........................----.....................3...............\n............2............................2.....................----.............\n...........3............................3........................4..............\n(.(.----------------.+.2.+.3.).*.----------------.+.2.).*.2.+.------.+.1.+.2.*.5\n............2............................2.......................2..............\n...........5............................5.......................2...............\n..........----.........................----....................----.............\n............6............................6.......................2..............\n.........------.......................------....................3...............\n............3............................3......................................\n..........----.........................----.....................................\n............2............................2......................................\n...........7............................7.......................................\n0\n\nOutput for the Sample Input\n\n501\n502\n1\n74\n19\n2010\n821\n821\n1646\n148\n81\n1933"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Given a circle with radius r, that circle may be placed so that it encircles all of the circles in the set C if r is large enough.\n\n\nThere may be more than one possible position of the circle of radius r to encircle all the member circles of C. We define the region U as the union of the areas of encircling circles at all such positions.

The following is an example of a Stylish program.\n\n\n1 ( Welcome .to\n2 ......... Stylish )\n3 { Stylish .is\n4 .....[.( a. programming . language .fun .to. learn )\n5 .......]\n6 ..... Maybe .[\n7 ....... It. will .be.an. official . ICPC . language\n8 .......]\n9 .....}\n\n\nAs you see in the example, a Stylish program is indented by periods. The amount of indentation of a line is the number of leading periods of it.\n\n\nYour mission is to visit Stylish masters, learn their indentation styles, and become the youngest Stylish master. An indentation style for well-indented Stylish programs is defined by a triple of integers, (R, C, S), satisfying 1 \u2264 R, C, S \u2264 20. R, C and S are amounts of indentation introduced by an open round bracket, an open curly bracket, and an open square bracket, respectively.\n\n\nIn a well-indented program, the amount of indentation of a line is given by R(ro \u2212 rc) + C(co \u2212 cc) + S(so \u2212 sc), where ro, co, and so are the numbers of occurrences of open round, curly, and square brackets in all preceding lines, respectively, and rc, cc, and sc are those of close brackets. The first line has no indentation in any well-indented program.\n\n\nThe above example is formatted in the indentation style (R, C, S) = (9, 5, 2). The only grouping symbol occurring in the first line of the above program is an open round bracket. Therefore the amount of indentation for the second line is 9 \u00b7 (1 \u2212 0) + 5 \u00b7 (0 \u2212 0) + 2 \u00b7(0 \u2212 0) = 9. The first four lines contain two open round brackets, one open curly bracket, one open square bracket, two close round brackets, but no close curly nor square bracket. Therefore the amount of indentation for the fifth line is 9 \u00b7 (2 \u2212 2) + 5 \u00b7 (1 \u2212 0) + 2 \u00b7 (1 \u2212 0) = 7.\n\n\nStylish masters write only well-indented Stylish programs. Every master has his/her own indentation style.\n\n\nWrite a program that imitates indentation styles of Stylish masters.\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of multiple datasets. The first line of a dataset contains two integers p (1 \u2264 p \u2264 10) and q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 10). The next p lines form a well-indented program P written by a\nStylish master and the following q lines form another program Q. You may assume that every line of both programs has at least one character and at most 80 characters. Also, you may assume that no line of Q starts with a period.\n\n\nThe last dataset is followed by a line containing two zeros.\n\nOutput\n\nApply the indentation style of P to Q and output the appropriate amount of indentation for each line of Q. The amounts must be output in a line in the order of corresponding lines of Q and they must be separated by a single space. The last one should not be followed by trailing spaces. If the appropriate amount of indentation of a line of Q cannot be determined uniquely through analysis of P, then output -1 for that line.\n\nSample Input\n\n5 4\n(Follow.my.style\n.........starting.from.round.brackets)\n{then.curly.brackets\n.....[.and.finally\n.......square.brackets.]}\n(Thank.you\n{for.showing.me\n[all\nthe.secrets]})\n4 2\n(This.time.I.will.show.you\n.........(how.to.use.round.brackets)\n.........[but.not.about.square.brackets]\n.........{nor.curly.brackets})\n(I.learned\nhow.to.use.round.brackets)\n4 2\n(This.time.I.will.show.you\n.........(how.to.use.round.brackets)\n.........[but.not.about.square.brackets]\n.........{nor.curly.brackets})\n[I.have.not.learned\nhow.to.use.square.brackets]\n2 2\n(Be.smart.and.let.fear.of\n..(closed.brackets).go)\n(A.pair.of.round.brackets.enclosing\n[A.line.enclosed.in.square.brackets])\n1 2\nTelling.you.nothing.but.you.can.make.it\n[One.liner.(is).(never.indented)]\n[One.liner.(is).(never.indented)]\n2 4\n([{Learn.from.my.KungFu\n...}])\n((\n{{\n[[\n]]}}))\n1 2\nDo.not.waste.your.time.trying.to.read.from.emptiness\n(\n)\n2 3\n({Quite.interesting.art.of.ambiguity\n....})\n{\n(\n)}\n2 4\n({[\n............................................................]})\n(\n{\n[\n]})\n0 0\n\nOutput for the Sample Input\n\n0 9 14 16\n0 9\n0 -1\n0 2\n0 0\n0 2 4 6\n0 -1\n0 -1 4\n0 20 40 60"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

All light sources have sizes small enough to be modeled as point light sources, and they emit light in all directions. The surfaces of the balloons absorb light and do not reflect light. Surprisingly in this world, balloons may overlap.\n\n\nYou want the total illumination intensity at an objective point as high as possible. For this purpose, some of the balloons obstructing lights can be removed. Because of the removal costs, however, there is a certain limit on the number of balloons to be removed. Thus, you would like to remove an appropriate set of balloons so as to maximize the illumination intensity at the objective point.\n\n\nThe following figure illustrates the configuration specified in the first dataset of the sample input given below. The figure shows the xy-plane, which is enough because, in this dataset, the z-coordinates of all the light sources, balloon centers, and the objective point are zero. In the figure, light sources are shown as stars and balloons as circles. The objective point is at the origin, and you may remove up to 4 balloons. In this case, the dashed circles in the figure correspond to the balloons to be removed.\n\n\n\n\nFigure G.1: First dataset of the sample input.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe input is a sequence of datasets. Each dataset is formatted as follows.\n\n\nN M R\nS1x S1y S1z S1r\n...\nSNx SNy SNz SNr\nT1x T1y T1z T1b\n...\nTMx TMy TMz TMb\nEx Ey Ez\n\n\nThe first line of a dataset contains three positive integers, N, M and R, separated by a single space. N means the number of balloons that does not exceed 2000. M means the number of light sources that does not exceed 15. R means the number of balloons that may be removed, which does not exceed N.\n\n\nEach of the N lines following the first line contains four integers separated by a single space. (Six, Siy, Siz) means the center position of the i-th balloon and Sir means its radius.\n\n\nEach of the following M lines contains four integers separated by a single space. (Tjx, Tjy, Tjz) means the position of the j-th light source and Tjb means its brightness.\n\n\nThe last line of a dataset contains three integers separated by a single space. (Ex, Ey, Ez) means the position of the objective point.\n\n\nSix, Siy, Siz, Tjx, Tjy, Tjz, Ex, Ey and Ez are greater than -500, and less than 500. Sir is greater than 0, and less than 500.

The first line of a dataset consists of two integers n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100) and m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 10000), which indicate the number of groups and the number of constraints, respectively. Then, description of m constraints follows. The description of each constraint consists of three integers s (1 \u2264 s \u2264 5), i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n), and j (1 \u2264 j \u2264 n, j \u2260= i), meaning a constraint of the s-th type imposed on the i-th group and the j-th group. The type number of a constraint is as listed above.
