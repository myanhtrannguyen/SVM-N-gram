The word \"privacy\" is not in her dictionary. A person like her is called \"stoker\" or \"yandere\", but it doesn't mean much to her.\n\n\nTo know about him, she set up spyware to his PC. This spyware can record his mouse operations while he is browsing websites. After a while, she could successfully obtain the record from the spyware in absolute secrecy.\n\n\nWell, we want you to write a program which extracts web pages he visited from the records.\n\n\nAll pages have the same size H \u00d7 W where upper-left corner is (0, 0) and lower right corner is (W, H). A page includes several (or many) rectangular buttons (parallel to the page). Each button has a link to another page, and when a button is clicked the browser leads you to the corresponding page.\n\n\nHis browser manages history and the current page in the following way:\n\n\nThe browser has a buffer of 1-dimensional array with enough capacity to store pages, and a pointer to indicate a page in the buffer. A page indicated by the pointer is shown on the browser. At first, a predetermined page is stored and the pointer indicates that page. When the link button is clicked, all pages recorded in the right side from the pointer are removed from the buffer. Then, the page indicated by the link button is stored into the right-most position of the buffer, and the pointer moves to right. As a result, the user browse the page indicated by the button.\n\n\nThe browser also has special buttons 'back to the previous page' (back button) and 'forward to the next page' (forward button). When the user clicks the back button, the pointer moves to left, and the user clicks the forward button, the pointer moves to right. But in both cases, if there are no such pages in the buffer, nothing happen.\n\n\nThe record consists of the following operations:\n\n\nclick x y\n\n\nIt means to click (x, y). If there is a button on the point (x, y), he moved to the corresponding page. If there is nothing in the point, nothing happen. The button is clicked if x1 \u2264 x \u2264 x2 and y1 \u2264 y \u2264 y2 where x1, x2 means the leftmost and rightmost coordinate and y1, y2 means the topmost and bottommost coordinate of the corresponding button respectively.\n\n\nback\n\n\nIt means to click the Back button.\n\n\nforward\n\n\nIt means to click the Forward button.\n\n\nIn addition, there is a special operation show. Your program should print the name of current page for each show operation.\n\n\nBy the way, setting spyware into computers of others may conflict with the law.

Miracle power that the christmas tree spread over the sky like a web and form a paths that the sleigh can go on. Since the paths with thicker miracle power is easier to go, these paths can be expressed as undirected weighted graph.\n\n\nDerivering the present is very strict about time. When it begins dawning the miracle power rapidly weakens and Santa Clause can not continue derivering any more. Her pride as a Santa Clause never excuses such a thing, so she have to finish derivering before dawning.\n\n\nThe sleigh a reindeer pulls departs from christmas tree (which corresponds to 0th node), and go across the city to the opposite fringe (n-1 th node) along the shortest path.

This is handed down for generations in the royal palace as a treasure. Es left a memo and filled mysterious values in it. Within achievements of researches, it has been revealed that the values denote coordinate values. However it is still unknown the definition of the coordinate system.\n\n\nBy the way, you are a person who lived in age of Es lived. The values which meister Es left are defined by following. Es set an moving object in the artifact sphere. Surprisingly, that is rigid body and perpetual organization. The object rotates inside the sphere and it is always touching the inside surface of the sphere. This value is a coordinate of the tangent point by the object and the sphere, but it is not a three dimensional value. The object is a plate and this is a simple polygon. Here, \"simple\" means \"non self-intersected\". This rotates while touching a great circle of the sphere. Here, assume that the great circle is a circle O centered in the origin in the xy plane. (It is two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, the direction of positive x-value is right and the direction of positive y-value is up). This plate touches the circle O with a single point at the beginning of the movement. And it rotates in counterclockwise as the current touching point is the rotation fulcrum. When another point X of the plate touches the circle O newly, the plate continue to rotate as described above, but in the next rotation, the rotation fulcrum point is changed.  This will be the point X. If two or more points can be interpreted as the point X, the point X is a most distant point from the currently touching point X'. Here, that distance is the length of the arc of the circle O from the point X' to the point X in clockwise.\n\n\nEs asked you, an excellent assistant, to write a program that enumerates Q tangent points (fulcrum points while the movement) by the plate and the circle O while the movement of the plate described above in the chronological order.

We call following 2-dimensional grid of m by n characters Tower. The objective of this game is to move blocks in the tower to climb to a goal block. In the following grid, the bottom line is the first row and the top one is the n-th row. The leftmost column is the first column and the rightmost one is the m-th column.\n\n\n....................

If the count is zero, this block will be broken and become a space.\n'S' : PlayerThe player.\n\nExplanation of relative positions:\n\n123\n4S5\n678\n\n\nIn the following description, assume that left up is the position of 1, up(over S) is 2, right up is 3, left is 4, right is 5, left down is 6, down(under S) is 7, right down is 8 for S.\n\nMovements of the player\nThe player must not go out of the tower.  The outside of the tower is considered as space cells.\n\n\nMoveThe player can move everywhere in the current row as long as some of the following conditions are satisfied.\n\nThe player is in the first row and the target cell is a space.\nThere are blocks under the route connecting the current cell and the target cell (horizontal segment) and the target cell is a space.  It is OK that some blocks in the horizontal segment.  And the case that some of blocks under the segment are different dimensional ones, it is also OK.\n\n\nClimb\nIf the player at the row below the n-th row (from 1st to n-1 th row) and there is a block in the right(left) and both of a cell over the player (up cell) and a right up(left up) cell are space, the player can move to the right up(left up) cell.\nGet down\nIf the player at the row above the 1st row (from 2nd to n-th row), he can get down to right(left) down.  If the direction for getting down is right(left) and if there is no blocks in the right down (left down) cell and the right (left) cell, the player can move to the right down (left down) cell.\nPush\nIf there is a block or continuous blocks in the right or left of the player, he can push the blocks to the direction one cell.  Here, blocks are \"continuous\" if there are two or more blocks and no space exist between them.  However, if there is a fixed block in pushing blocks, the player can not push them.  Pushed blocks will not stop the end of the row of the tower (1st and mth column). If the pushed blocks go out of the tower, this will be vanished.In the result of pushing, a block moved over the ice block continues to move to the pushed direction as long as there is a space in the progress direction, there is an ice block under the block and the pushed block is not vanished.\nIf the pushed block is an ice block, this continues to move to the pushed direction as long as there is a block under the ice block, there is a space in the progress direction and the pushed ice block is not vanished. However, for an ice block in the first row, the below the block do not have to be a space. And here, if the player pushes continuous blocks, pushing movements begin from the most distant block to a nearest block.  Here, the distance is manhattan distance at the gird.\nPull\nIf there is a block in the right(left) of the player and the left(right) cell is space, the player can pull the block.  However, if the pulling block is fixed one, he can not pull this.  If the player pulls block, the player will move one cell to the direction of pulling.\n\n\nAutomated operations after the player operation:\nAutomated operations occur in the following order.  This repeats in this order as long as the cells of the tower are changed by this operations.  After this operations, the player can do the next operation.\n\n\nCountdown of fragile blocks\nIf the player over a fragile block moved to somewhere else, that fragile block's count will decrease by one.  However, this count does not change if the player over the fragile block is moved to somewhere else by the automated operations.\nErasing blocksA block over an different dimensional block will be vanished.\nFalling of the playerIf there is no block under the player, the player continues to fall as long as satisfying this condition or come to 1st row.\nFalling of blocksIf there is no block under a block and left down and right down of a certain block, the block in the row over the 1st row (from 2nd to n-th row) continues to fall as long as satisfying this condition.  Falling of blocks begins from lower blocks of the tower and then lefter blocks.\n\nConditions for game over:\nAfter the movement of the player or the automated operations, the game is over when the one of next conditions is satisfied.  These conditions are judged in the following order. Note that, the condition (E) should not be judged after the movement of the player.\n\n\n(A) The player is over the goal block.\n(B) The player is over the different dimensional block.\n(C) The player and a block is in the same cell.\n(D) The goal block is moved from its initial position.\n(E) There is no next commands.\n\nFinally, show some examples.\nDocuments of commands will be give in the description of Input.\n\nExample table\nMovement orAutomated operationBeforeAfterCommand\nMove.#S###S#.###MOVETO 1\nClimb...3S#S..3.#CLIMB LEFT\nGet downS..3.#...2S#GETDOWN RIGHT\nPush.#S#####..###II.I.I..#S.####.####II.I.I.PUSH RIGHT\nPush.#SI...###.###.#S....###.###PUSH RIGHT\nPush.#...S####.###.....S.###.###PUSH RIGHT\nPull..S#####..###.#.#.#..S#.####..###.#.#.#.PULL LEFT\nFalling of the player.#S#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#S#-\nFalling of blocks.###.#...##...##...#.#.#.#.#.#...##...##.#.#.#.#-\n\nInput\n\nInput consists of multiple datasets.\nA dataset is given in the following format.\n\n\nn m\nDn,1 Dn,2 ...

For example, the expression 1+3i\nin mathematics should be written as 1+3*i.\nUsual formation rules of arithmetic expressions apply.
