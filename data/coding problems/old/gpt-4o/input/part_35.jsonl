Santa's Gift\n\n\n  Santa is going to pack gifts into a bag for a family. There are $N$ kinds of gifts. The size and the price of the $i$-th gift ($1 \\leq i \\leq N$) are $s_i$ and $p_i$, respectively. The size of the bag is $C$, thus Santa can pack gifts so that the total size of the gifts does not exceed $C$. Children are unhappy if they are given multiple items of the same kind gift, so Santa has to choose at most one gift of the same kind per child.\n\n\n  In addition, if a child did not receive a gift that the other children in the same family receive, he/she will complain about that. Hence Santa must distribute gifts fairly to all the children of a family, by giving the same set of gifts to each child. In other words, for a family with $k$ children, Santa must pack zero or $k$ items for each kind of gifts. Santa gives one bag to one family, therefore, the total size of the gifts for each family does not exceed $C$.\n\n\n  Santa wants to maximize the total price of packed items for a family but does not know the number of children in the family he is going to visit yet. The number seems at most $M$. To prepare all the possible cases, calculate the maximum total price of items for a family with $k$ children for each $1 \\leq k \\leq M$.\n\nInput\n\n  The input consists of a single test case in the following format.\n\n\n$C$ $N$ $M$\n$s_1$ $p_1$\n$...$\n$s_N$ $p_N$\n\n\n  The first line contains three integers $C$, $N$ and $M$, where $C$ ($1 \\leq C \\leq 10^4$) is the size of the bag, $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 10^4$) is the number of kinds of the gifts, and $M$ ($1 \\leq M \\leq 10^4$) is the maximum number of children in the family. The $i$-th line of the following $N$ lines contains two integers $s_i$ and $p_i$ ($1 \\leq s_i, p_i \\leq 10^4$), where $s_i$ and $p_i$ are the size and the price of the $i$-th gift, respectively.\n\nOutput\n\n  The output should consist of $M$ lines.

Rough Sorting\n\n\n  For skilled programmers, it is very easy to implement a sorting function. Moreover, they often avoid full sorting to reduce computation time if it is not necessary. Here, we consider \"rough sorting\" which sorts an array except for some pairs of elements. More formally, we define an array is \"$K$-roughly sorted\" if an array is sorted except that at most $K$ pairs are in reversed order. For example, '1 3 2 4' is 1-roughly sorted because (3, 2) is only the reversed pair. In the same way, '1 4 2 3' is 2-roughly sorted because (4, 2) and (4, 3) are reversed.\n\n\n  Considering rough sorting by exchanging adjacent elements repeatedly, you need less number of swaps than full sorting. For example, '4 1 2 3' needs three exchanges for full sorting, but you only need to exchange once for 2-rough sorting.\n\n\n  Given an array and an integer $K$, your task is to find the result of the $K$-rough sorting with a minimum number of exchanges. If there are several possible results, you should output the lexicographically minimum result. Here, the lexicographical order is defined by the order of the first different elements.\n\nInput\n\n  The input consists of a single test case in the following format.\n\n\n$N$ $K$\n$x_1$\n$\\vdots$\n$x_N$\n\n  \n  The first line contains two integers $N$ and $K$. The integer $N$ is the number of the elements of the array ($1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$). The integer $K$ gives how many reversed pairs are allowed ($1 \\leq K \\leq 10^9$). Each of the following $N$ lines gives the element of the array. The array consists of the permutation of $1$ to $N$, therefore $1 \\leq x_i \\leq N$ and $x_i \\ne x_j$ ($i \\ne j$) are satisfied.\n\nOutput\n\n  The output should contain $N$ lines. The $i$-th line should be the $i$-th element of the result of the $K$-rough sorting. If there are several possible results, you should output the minimum result with the lexicographical order.\n\nExamples\nSample Input 1\n\n3 1\n3\n2\n1\n\nOutput for Sample Input 1\n\n1\n3\n2\n\nSample Input 2\n\n3 100\n3\n2\n1\n\nOutput for Sample Input 2\n\n3\n2\n1\n\nSample Input 3\n\n5 3\n5\n3\n2\n1\n4\n\nOutput for Sample Input 3\n\n1\n3\n5\n2\n4\n\nSample Input 4\n\n5 3\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nOutput for Sample Input 4\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n\nIn the last example, the input array is already sorted, which means the input is already a 3-roughly sorted array and no swapping is needed."}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

It's a mathematical exercise common in Japan. In this problem, we consider the generalization of the exercise, $N$-by-$M$ grid calculation.\nIn this exercise, you are given an $N$-by-$M$ grid (i.e. a grid with $N$ rows and $M$ columns) with an additional column and row at the top and the left of the grid, respectively. Each cell of the additional column and row has a positive integer. Let's denote the sequence of integers on the column and row by $a$ and $b$, and the $i$-th integer from the top in the column is $a_i$ and the $j$-th integer from the left in the row is $b_j$, respectively.\nInitially, each cell in the grid (other than the additional column and row) is blank. Let $(i, j)$ be the cell at the $i$-th from the top and the $j$-th from the left. The exercise expects you to fill all the cells so that the cell $(i, j)$ has $a_i \\times b_j$. You have to start at the top-left cell. You repeat to calculate the multiplication $a_i \\times b_j$ for a current cell $(i, j)$, and then move from left to right until you reach the rightmost cell, then move to the leftmost cell of the next row below.\nAt the end of the exercise, you will write a lot, really a lot of digits on the cells. Your teacher, who gave this exercise to you, looks like bothering to check entire cells on the grid to confirm that you have done this exercise. So the teacher thinks it is OK if you can answer the $d$-th digit (not integer, see an example below), you have written for randomly chosen $x$. Let's see an example.\n\nFor this example, you calculate values on cells, which are $8$, $56$, $24$, $1$, $7$, $3$ in order. Thus, you would write digits 8, 5, 6, 2, 4, 1, 7, 3. So the answer to a question $4$ is $2$.\nYou noticed that you can answer such questions even if you haven't completed the given exercise.

His company is planning to form a zombie rock band named Gray Faces and cheer Chiba Prefecture up.\nBut, unfortunately, there is only one zombie in ICPC. So, Tatsumi decided to release the zombie on a platform of Soga station to produce a sufficient number of zombies. As you may know, a zombie changes a human into a new zombie by passing by the human. In other words, a human becomes a zombie when the human and a zombie are at the same point. Note that a zombie who used to be a human changes a human into a zombie too.\nThe platform of Soga station is represented by an infinitely long line, and Tatsumi will release a zombie at a point with coordinate $x_Z$. After the release, the zombie will start walking in the positive direction at $v_Z$ per second. If $v_Z$ is negative, the zombie will walk in the negative direction at $|v_Z|$ per second.\nThere are $N$ humans on the platform.

Its bombing pattern is always fixed and represented by an $N \\times N$ grid. Each symbol in the bombing pattern is either X or .. The meaning of each symbol is as follows.\n\nX: Bomb \n.: Empty\n\nHere, suppose that a bomber is in $(br, bc)$ in the land and drops a bomb. The cell $(br + i - 1, bc + j - 1)$ will be damaged if the symbol in the $i$-th row and the $j$-th column of the bombing pattern is X ($1 \\le i, j \\le N$).\nInitially, the bomber reached $(1, 1)$ in JAG land. The bomber repeated to move to either of $4$-directions and then dropped a bomb just $L$ times. During this attack, the values of the coordinates of the bomber were between $1$ and $M - N + 1$, inclusive, while it dropped bombs. Finally, the bomber left the country.\nThe moving pattern of the bomber is described as $L$ characters. The $i$-th character corresponds to the $i$-th move and the meaning of each character is as follows.\n\nU: Up\nD: Down\nL: Left\nR: Right\n\nYour task is to write a program to analyze the damage situation in JAG land.
