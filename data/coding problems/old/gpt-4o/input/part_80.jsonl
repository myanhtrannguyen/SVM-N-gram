These doughnuts are called Doughnut 1, Doughnut 2, ..., Doughnut N. In order to make one Doughnut i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 N), she needs to consume m_i grams of Moto. She cannot make a non-integer number of doughnuts, such as 0.5 doughnuts.\nThe recipes of these doughnuts are developed by repeated modifications from the recipe of Doughnut 1. Specifically, the recipe of Doughnut i (2 \u2264 i \u2264 N) is a direct modification of the recipe of Doughnut p_i (1 \u2264 p_i < i).\nNow, she has X grams of Moto. She decides to make as many doughnuts as possible for a party tonight. However, since the tastes of the guests differ, she will obey the following condition:\n\nLet c_i be the number of Doughnut i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 N) that she makes. For each integer i such that 2 \u2264 i \u2264 N, c_{p_i} \u2264 c_i \u2264 c_{p_i} + D must hold. Here, D is a predetermined value.\n\nAt most how many doughnuts can be made here?
