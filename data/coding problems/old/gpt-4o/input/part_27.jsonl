Some of squares are painted either in black or some colorful color (such as red and blue) on the front side. Cutting off the unpainted part, she will have eight opened-up unit cubes. A unit cube here refers to a cube of which each face consists of one square.\n\n\nShe is going to build those eight unit cubes with the front side exposed and then a bicube with them. A bicube is a cube of the size 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2, consisting of eight unit cubes, that satisfies the following conditions:\n\n\n faces of the unit cubes that comes to the inside of the bicube are all black;\n each face of the bicube has a uniform colorful color; and\n the faces of the bicube have colors all different.\n\n\nYour task is to write a program that reads the specification of a sheet of squared paper and decides whether a\nbicube can be built with the eight unit cubes resulting from it.\n\nInput\n\nThe input contains the specification of a sheet. The first line contains two integers H and W, which denote the height and width of the sheet (3 \u2264 H, W \u2264 50). Then H lines follow, each consisting of W characters. These lines show the squares on the front side of the sheet. A character represents the color of a grid: alphabets and digits ('A' to 'Z', 'a' to 'z', '0' to '9') for colorful squares, a hash ('#') for a black square, and a dot ('.') for an unpainted square. Each alphabet or digit denotes a unique color: squares have the same color if and only if they are represented by the same character.\n\n\nEach component of connected squares forms one opened-up cube. Squares are regarded as connected when they have a common edge; those just with a common vertex are not.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint \"Yes\" if a bicube can be built with the given sheet; \"No\" otherwise.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3 40\n.a....a....a....a....f....f....f....f...\n#bc#.#cd#.#de#.#eb#.#cb#.#dc#.#ed#.#be#.\n.#....#....#....#....#....#....#....#...\n\nOutput for the Sample Input 1\n\nYes\n\n\nSample Input 2\n\n5 35\n.a....a....a....a....f....f....f...\n#bc#.#cd#.#de#.#eb#.#cb#.#dc#.#ed#.\n.#..f.#....#....#....#....#....#...\n..e##..............................\n.b#................................\n\nOutput for the Sample Input 2\n\nYes\n\n\nSample Input 3\n\n3 40\n.a....a....a....a....f....f....f....f...\n#bc#.#cd#.#de#.#eb#.#cb#.#dc#.#ed#.#eb#.\n.#....#....#....#....#....#....#....#...\n\nOutput for the Sample Input 3\n\nNo"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The machine has $N$ magic hands placed above the conveyor belt at regular intervals of $M$. These magic hands put tampopos every $T$ seconds.\n\n\n  In initial state, the right end of the first package is under the leftmost magic hand. The magic hands start putting a tampopo as soon as he turns on the power of the machine. The conveyor belt moves one unit length per one second.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Unfortunately, after building the machine, Yaruo noticed that there exist some packages with no tampopos. Calculate the ratio of packages with no tampopos for him.\n\n\nWhen a magic hand puts a tampopo on the left or right end of a package, you can assume that the tampopo is on the package.\n\nInput\n\n  The input consists of 5 integers, $W$, $D$, $N$, $M$ and $T$ which are described in the problem statement.\n  \n($1 \\leq W, D, N, M, T \\leq 1,000,000,000$)\n\nOutput\n\nOutput the ratio of packages with no tampopos in a line. The absolute error should be less than or equal to $10^{-9}$.\n\nSample Input 1\n1 1 1 1 1\nSample Output 1\n0.000000000000\nSample Input 2\n1 2 3 4 5\nSample Output 2\n0.200000000000\nSample Input 3\n3 2 2 1 6\nSample Output 3\n0.166666666667"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Mustang found an ancient personal computer in the closet.\nHe brought it back to his room and turned it on with a sense of nostalgia, seeing a message coming on the screen:\n\n\nREADY?\n\n\nYes. BASIC.\n\n\nBASIC is a programming language designed for beginners, and was widely used from 1980's to 1990's.\nThere have been quite a few BASIC dialects.\nSome of them provide the PLAY statement, which plays music when called with a string of a musical score written in Music Macro Language (MML).\nDick found this statement is available on his computer and accepts the following commands in MML:\n\n\nNotes: Cn, C+n, C-n, Dn, D+n, D-n, En,...,... (n = 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128 + dots)\nEach note command consists of a musical note followed by a duration specifier.\nEach musical note is one of the seven basic notes: 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'A', and 'B'.  It can be followed by either '+' (indicating a sharp) or '-' (a flat).  The notes 'C' through 'B' form an octave as depicted in the figure below.  The octave for each command is determined by the current octave, which is set by the octave commands as described later.  It is not possible to play the note 'C-' of the lowest octave (1) nor the note 'B+' of the highest octave (8).\nEach duration specifier is basically one of the following numbers: '1', '2', '4', '8', '16', '32', '64', and '128', where '1' denotes a whole note, '2' a half note, '4' a quarter note, '8' an eighth note, and so on.  This specifier is optional; when omitted, the duration will be the default one set by the L command (which is described below).  In addition, duration specifiers can contain dots next to the numbers.  A dot adds the half duration of the basic note.  For example, '4.' denotes the duration of '4' (a quarter) plus '8' (an eighth, i.e. half of a quarter), or as 1.5 times long as '4'.  It is possible that a single note has more than one dot, where each extra dot extends the duration by half of the previous one.  For example, '4..' denotes the duration of '4' plus '8' plus '16', '4...' denotes the duration of '4' plus '8' plus '16' plus '32', and so on.  The duration extended by dots cannot be shorter than that of '128' due to limitation of Dick's computer; therefore neither '128.' nor '32...' will be accepted.  The dots specified without the numbers extend the default duration.  For example, 'C.' is equivalent to 'C4.' when the default duration is '4'.  Note that 'C4C8' and 'C4.' are unequivalent; the former contains two distinct notes, while the latter just one note.\nRest: Rn (n = 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128 + dots)\nThe R command rests  for the specified duration.  The duration should be specified in the same way as the note commands, and it can be omitted, too.  Note that 'R4R8' and 'R4.' are equivalent, unlike 'C4C8' and 'C4.', since the both rest for the same duration of '4' plus '8'.\nOctave: On (n = 1-8), <, >\nThe O command sets the current octave to the specified number.  '>'  raises one octave up, and '<'  drops one down.  It is not allowed to set the octave beyond the range from 1 to 8 by these commands.  The  octave is initially set to 4.\nDefault duration: Ln (n = 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128)\nThe L command sets the default duration.  The duration should be specified in the same way as the note commands, but cannot be omitted nor followed by dots.  The default duration is initially set to 4.\nVolume: Vn (n = 1-255)\nThe V command sets the current volume.  Larger is louder.  The  volume is initially set to 100.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an amateur composer, Dick decided to play his pieces of music by the PLAY statement.\nHe managed to write a program with a long MML sequence, and attempted to run the program to play his music -- but unfortunately he encountered an unexpected error: the MML sequence was too long to be handled in his computer's small memory!\n\n\nSince he didn't want to give up all the efforts he had made to use the PLAY statement, he decided immediately to make the MML sequence shorter so that it fits in the small memory.\nIt  was too hard for him, though.\nSo he asked you to write a program that, for each given MML sequence, prints the shortest MML sequence (i.e. MML sequence containing minimum number of characters) that expresses the same music as the given one.\nNote that the final values of  octave,  volume, and default duration can be differrent from the original MML sequence.\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of multiple data sets.  Each data set is given by a single line that contains an MML sequence up to 100,000 characters.\nAll sequences only contain the commands described above.\nNote that each sequence contains at least one note, and there is no rest before the first note and after the last note.\n\n\nThe end of input is indicated by a line that only contains \"*\".\nThis is not part of any data sets and hence should not be processed.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print its case number and the shortest MML sequence on a line.\n\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\nSample Input\n\nC4C4G4G4A4A4G2F4F4E4E4D4D4C2\nO4C4.C8F4.F8G8F8E8D8C2\nB-8>C8<B-8V40R2R..R8.V100EV50L1CG\n*\n\nOutput for the Sample Input\n\nCase 1: CCGGAAG2FFEEDDC2\nCase 2: C.C8F.L8FGFEDC2\nCase 3: L8B-B+B-RL1RE4V50CG"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

It is possible that a single note has more than one dot, where each extra dot extends the duration by half of the previous one.
