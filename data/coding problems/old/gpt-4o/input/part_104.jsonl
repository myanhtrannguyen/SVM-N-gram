Note that the search query that represents the whole blackboard is also counted as the number of search queries. \n\n\n\n\n\n  Note that the output needs to be flushed every time the output is printed. \n  For example, In C/C++, search query s1, s2 can be printed as follows. \n\nprintf(\"%s\\n%s\\n\", s1, s2); fflush(stdout);\n\n  Make sure your program receive all the input from the device.
