Unfortunately, you are ordered to check if all the participants have properly cleaned their rooms.\n\n\nThe accommodation facility is a rectangular field whose height is $H$ and width is $W$. The field is divided into square cells. The rows are numbered $1$ through $H$ from top to bottom and the columns are numbered $1$ through $W$ from left to right. The cell in row $i$, column $j$ is denoted by $(i, j)$. Two cells are adjacent if they share an edge.\n\n\nEach cell is called either a wall cell or a floor cell. A wall cell represents a wall which no one can enter. \nA floor cell is a part of the inside of the accommodation facility. Everybody can move between two adjacent floor cells. The floor cells are divided into several units. Each unit is assigned an uppercase English letter (A, B, C, ...). A floor cell adjacent to exactly one floor cell is called a room. Otherwise the floor cell is called an aisle. For example, the accommodation facility can be shown as the following figure. We denote a wall cell by .

The staffs can move between two adjacent floor cells in $T_{\\mathit{move}}$ time. To check the room at $(i, j)$, the staffs must move to the cell $(i, j)$ and spend $T_{\\mathit{check}}$ time there. Each staff first determines the order of the units to check and he or she must check the rooms according to the order. For example, suppose that there is a staff who is assigned units A, C, and E. He may decide that the order is E->A->C. After that, he must check all the rooms in unit E at first. Then, he must check all the rooms in unit A, and so on. The staffs can pass any floor cells. However, the staffs cannot check rooms that are not assigned to them. Further, the staffs cannot check rooms against the order of units that they have decided. \n After checking all the assigned rooms, the staffs must return to the cell $(s, t)$. \n When every staff returns to the cell $(s, t)$, the task is done. \n\n\nBecause you do not have enough time before the next contest, you want to minimize the total time to check all the rooms.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains three integers $H$, $W$, and $K$ ($1 \\le H \\le 50$, $1 \\le W \\le 50$, $1 \\le K \\le 12$).

The field is divided into square cells. The rows are numbered $1$ through $H$ from top to bottom and the columns are numbered $1$ through $W$ from left to right. The cell in row $i$, column $j$ is denoted by $(i, j)$. Two cells are adjacent if they share an edge.\n\n\nEach cell is called either a wall cell or a floor cell. A wall cell represents a wall which no one can enter. \nA floor cell is a part of the inside of the accommodation facility. Everybody can move between two adjacent floor cells. The floor cells are divided into several units. Each unit is assigned an uppercase English letter (A, B, C, ...). A floor cell adjacent to exactly one floor cell is called a room. Otherwise the floor cell is called an aisle. For example, the accommodation facility can be shown as the following figure. We denote a wall cell by . (single period).\n\n...................\n.....AAABBBBBBB....\n...A.AA.A...B.B..B.\n..AAAAAAAABBBBBBBB.\n...A..A.A.....B....\n......A.......BBBB.\n....A.AA..C.C...B..\n...AAAAACCCCCCBBBB.\n...A..A...C.C...B..\n...................\n\nIn the above figure, there are $7$ rooms in unit A, $4$ rooms in unit B, and $4$ rooms in unit C.\n\n\nBecause the accommodation facility is too large to explore alone, you asked the other participants of the camp to check the rooms. For simplicity's sake, we call them staffs. Now, there are $K$ staffs at the cell $(s, t)$. You decided to check the rooms according to the following procedure.\n\n\n First, you assign each staff to some of units. Every unit must be assigned to exactly one staff. Note that it is allowed to assign all the units to one staff or to assign no units to some staffs.\n Then, each staff starts to check the rooms in the assigned units at the same time. The staffs can move between two adjacent floor cells in $T_{\\mathit{move}}$ time. To check the room at $(i, j)$, the staffs must move to the cell $(i, j)$ and spend $T_{\\mathit{check}}$ time there. Each staff first determines the order of the units to check and he or she must check the rooms according to the order. For example, suppose that there is a staff who is assigned units A, C, and E. He may decide that the order is E->A->C. After that, he must check all the rooms in unit E at first. Then, he must check all the rooms in unit A, and so on. The staffs can pass any floor cells. However, the staffs cannot check rooms that are not assigned to them. Further, the staffs cannot check rooms against the order of units that they have decided. \n After checking all the assigned rooms, the staffs must return to the cell $(s, t)$. \n When every staff returns to the cell $(s, t)$, the task is done. \n\n\nBecause you do not have enough time before the next contest, you want to minimize the total time to check all the rooms.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains three integers $H$, $W$, and $K$ ($1 \\le H \\le 50$, $1 \\le W \\le 50$, $1 \\le K \\le 12$). The second line contains four integers $s$, $t$, $T_{\\mathit{move}}$, and $T_{\\mathit{check}}$ ($1 \\le s \\le H$, $1 \\le t \\le W$, $1 \\le T_{\\mathit{move}},T_{\\mathit{check}} \\le 10{,}000$). Each of the following $H$ lines contains exactly $W$ characters. Each character represents a cell in the accommodation facility. The $j$-th character in the $i$-th line of these lines is . if the cell $(i, j)$ is a wall cell. Otherwise, the character is an uppercase English letter (A-L) representing the unit to which the cell $(i, j)$ belongs.\n\n\nYou can assume that the following conditions are satisfied.\n\n\n The number of rooms in each unit is between $1$ and $12$, inclusive. \n The cell $(s, t)$ is guaranteed to be an aisle.\n Floor cells in each unit are connected.\n Floor cells in the field are connected.\n Every unit contains at least two cells.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput the minimum required time to check all the rooms in one line.\n\nSample Input 1\n3 3 1\n1 1 10 10\nAAA\nA..\nA..\nOutput for the Sample Input 1\n100\nSample Input 2\n3 3 2\n1 1 10 10\nABB\nA..\nA..\nOutput for the Sample Input 2\n50\nSample Input 3\n5 10 3\n3 6 1 100\n...G.H.A..\n.AAGAHAABB\nFFAAAAAAA.\n.EEAAADACC\n..E...D...\nOutput for the Sample Input 3\n316\nSample Input 4\n10 19 2\n6 15 3 10\n...................\n.....AAABBBBBBB....\n...A.AA.A...B.B..B.\n..AAAAAAAABBBBBBBB.\n...A..A.A.....B....\n......A.......BBBB.\n....A.AA..C.C...B..\n...AAAAACCCCCCBBBB.\n...A..A...C.C...B..\n...................\nOutput for the Sample Input 4\n232\nSample Input 5\n27 36 6\n24 19 616 1933\n....................................\n..........B...............B.........\n..........BBB..........BBBB.........\n..........BBBBB.......BBBB..........\n...........BBBBBBBBBBBBBBB..........\n...........BBBBBBBBBBBBBBB..........\n...........BBBBBBBBBBBBBB...........\n............BBBBBBBBBBBBB...........\n...........BBBBBBBBBBBBBBB..........\n..........BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB.........\n......B...BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB...B.....\n......BB.BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB..BB.....\n.......BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB.BB......\n.........BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB.......\n........BBBBB..BBBBBBBB..BBBBB......\n......BBBBBB....BBBBB....BBBBBB.....\n.....BBBBBBBB...BBBBB..BBBBBBBB.B...\n...BBBBBBB..B...BBBBB..B..BBBBBBBB..\n.BBBBBBBBB.....BBBBBBB......BBBBBBB.\n..BBBBBBB......BBBBBBB........BBB...\n.BBBB.........BBBBBBBBB........BBB..\n..............BBBBBBBBB.............\n.............BBBBBBBBBB.............\n.............BBBBBBBBBB.............\n..............BBBBBBBB..............\n..............BBBBBBBB..............\n....................................\nOutput for the Sample Input 5\n137071"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The sniper can continuously rotate the laser gun by at most $\\omega$ degrees per unit time, either clockwise or counterclockwise, and can change the direction of rotation at any time. The laser gun is initially directed $\\theta$ degrees counterclockwise from the positive direction of the $x$-axis.\n\n\nYou are initially at ($x$, $y$) on the plane and can move in any direction at speed not more than $v$ (you can arbitrarily determine the value of $v$ since you are a very good runner). You will be shot by the sniper exactly when the laser gun is directed toward your position, that is, you can ignore the time that the laser reaches you from the laser gun. Assume that your body is a point and the laser is a half-line whose end point is (0, 0).\n\n\nFind the maximum speed $v$ at which you are shot by the sniper in finite time when you and the sniper behave optimally.\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of a single test case. The input contains four integers in a line, $x$, $y$, $\\theta$ and $\\omega$. The two integers $x$ and $y$ $(0 \\leq |x|, |y| \\leq 1,000$, ($x$, $y$) $\\ne$ (0, 0)) represent your initial position on the $xy$-plane. The integer $\\theta$ $(0 \\leq \\theta < 360)$ represents the initial direction of the laser gun: it is the counterclockwise angle in degrees from the positive direction of the $x$-axis. The integer $\\omega$ $(1 \\leq \\omega \\leq 100)$ is the angle which the laser gun can rotate in unit time. You can assume that you are not shot by the sniper at the initial position.\n\nOutput\n\nDisplay a line containing the maximum speed $v$ at which you are shot by the sniper in finite time. The\nabsolute error or the relative error should be less than $10^{-6}$.\n\nSample Input 1\n100 100 0 1\nOutput for the Sample Input 1\n1.16699564"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Each team must start at the checkpoint 1, and return back to the checkpoint\n1 in $P$ minutes. In order to show the performance ability of Kitafuji Brass Band to a festival\naudience, their stern coach would like to determine their performance course so that many people\nlisten their march as long as possible.\n\n\nThe coach uses \"impression degree\" to determine their best course.
