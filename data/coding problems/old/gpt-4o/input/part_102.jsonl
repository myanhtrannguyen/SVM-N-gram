Balls are numbered 1 through N from left to right. Holes are numbered 1 through N+1 from left to right. The i-th ball is located between the i-th hole and (i+1)-th hole. We denote the distance between neighboring items (one ball and one hole) from left to right as d_i (1 \\leq i \\leq 2 \\times N). You are given two parameters d_1 and x. d_i - d_{i-1} is equal to x for all i (2 \\leq i \\leq 2 \\times N).\nWe want to push all N balls into holes one by one. When a ball rolls over a hole, the ball will drop into the hole if there is no ball in the hole yet. Otherwise, the ball will pass this hole and continue to roll. (In any scenario considered in this problem, balls will never collide.)\nIn each step, we will choose one of the remaining balls uniformly at random and then choose a direction (either left or right) uniformly at random and push the ball in this direction. Please calculate the expected total distance rolled by all balls during this process.\nFor example, when N = 3, d_1 = 1, and x = 1, the following is one possible scenario:\n\n\n\n\nfirst step: push the ball numbered 2 to its left, it will drop into the hole numbered 2. The distance rolled is 3.\nsecond step: push the ball numbered 1 to its right, it will pass the hole numbered 2 and drop into the hole numbered 3. The distance rolled is 9.\nthird step: push the ball numbered 3 to its right, it will drop into the hole numbered 4. The distance rolled is 6.\n\nSo the total distance in this scenario is 18.\nNote that in all scenarios every ball will drop into some hole and there will be a hole containing no ball in the end.\n\n\n\n\nConstraints\n1 \\leq N \\leq 200,000\n1 \\leq d_1 \\leq 100\n0 \\leq x \\leq 100\nAll input values are integers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInputThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN d_1 x\n\n\n\n\n\nOutputPrint a floating number denoting the answer.

In terms of graph theory, there is a unique simple path connecting every pair of cities. That is, the N cities form a tree. Besides, if we view city 1 as the root of this tree, the tree will be a full binary tree (a tree is a full binary tree if and only if every non-leaf vertex in the tree has exactly two children). Roads are numbered 1 through N-1. The i-th road connects city i+1 and city a_i. When you pass through road i, the toll you should pay is v_i (if v_i is 0, it indicates the road does not require a toll).\nA company in city 1 will give each employee a family travel and cover a large part of the tolls incurred. Each employee can design the travel by themselves. That is, which cities he/she wants to visit in each day and which city to stay at each night. However, there are some constraints. More details are as follows:\n\n\nThe travel must start and end at city 1. If there are m leaves in the tree formed by the cities, then the number of days in the travel must be m+1. At the end of each day, except for the last day, the employee must stay at some hotel in a leaf city. During the whole travel, the employee must stay at all leaf cities exactly once.\n\n\nDuring the whole travel, all roads of the country must be passed through exactly twice.\n\n\nThe amount that the employee must pay for tolls by him/herself is the maximum total toll incurred in a single day during the travel, except the first day and the last day. The remaining tolls will be covered by the company.\n\n\nShik, as an employee of this company, has only one hope for his travel.
