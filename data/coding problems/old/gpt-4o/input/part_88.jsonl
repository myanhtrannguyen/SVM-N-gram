He decided to draw a big picture on the board with N+2 rows and M+2 columns of squares constructed in the venue of CODE FESTIVAL 2017, using some people.\nThe square at the (i+1)-th row and (j+1)-th column in the board is represented by the pair of integers (i,j). That is, the top-left square is (0,0), and the bottom-right square is (N+1,M+1).\nInitially, the squares (x,y) satisfying 1 \\leq x \\leq N and 1 \\leq y \\leq M are painted white, and the other (outermost) squares are painted black.\nRingo arranged people at some of the outermost squares, facing inward.\nMore specifically, the arrangement of people is represented by four strings A, B, C and D, as follows:\n\nFor each row except the top and bottom, if the i-th character (1 \\leq i \\leq N) in A is 1, place a person facing right at the square (i,0); otherwise, do nothing.\nFor each row except the top and bottom, if the i-th character (1 \\leq i \\leq N) in B is 1, place a person facing left at the square (i,M+1); otherwise, do nothing.\nFor each column except the leftmost and rightmost, if the i-th character (1 \\leq i \\leq M) in C is 1, place a person facing down at the square (0,i); otherwise, do nothing.\nFor each column except the leftmost and rightmost, if the i-th character (1 \\leq i \\leq M) in D is 1, place a person facing up at the square (N+1,i); otherwise, do nothing.\n\nEach person has a sufficient amount of non-white paint.

Snuke can perform the following four types of operations any number of times. He may choose not to perform some types of operations.\n\nOperation 1: Pour 100A grams of water into the beaker.\nOperation 2: Pour 100B grams of water into the beaker.\nOperation 3: Put C grams of sugar into the beaker.\nOperation 4: Put D grams of sugar into the beaker.\n\nIn our experimental environment, E grams of sugar can dissolve into 100 grams of water.\nSnuke will make sugar water with the highest possible density.\nThe beaker can contain at most F grams of substances (water and sugar combined), and there must not be any undissolved sugar in the beaker.\nFind the mass of the sugar water Snuke will make, and the mass of sugar dissolved in it.\nIf there is more than one candidate, any of them will be accepted.\nWe remind you that the sugar water that contains a grams of water and b grams of sugar is \\frac{100b}{a + b} percent.\nAlso, in this problem, pure water that does not contain any sugar is regarded as 0 percent density sugar water.\n\n\n\n\nConstraints\n1 \\leq A < B \\leq 30\n1 \\leq C < D \\leq 30\n1 \\leq E \\leq 100\n100A \\leq F \\leq 3 000\nA, B, C, D, E and F are all integers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInputsInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nA B C D E F\n\n\n\n\n\nOutputsPrint two integers separated by a space.\nThe first integer should be the mass of the desired sugar water, and the second should be the mass of the sugar dissolved in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Input 11 2 10 20 15 200\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Output 1110 10\n\nIn this environment, 15 grams of sugar can dissolve into 100 grams of water, and the beaker can contain at most 200 grams of substances.\nWe can make 110 grams of sugar water by performing Operation 1 once and Operation 3 once.\nIt is not possible to make sugar water with higher density.\nFor example, the following sequences of operations are infeasible:\n\nIf we perform Operation 1 once and Operation 4 once, there will be undissolved sugar in the beaker.\nIf we perform Operation 2 once and Operation 3 three times, the mass of substances in the beaker will exceed 200 grams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Input 21 2 1 2 100 1000\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Output 2200 100\n\nThere are other acceptable outputs, such as:\n400 200\n\nHowever, the output below is not acceptable:\n300 150\n\nThis is because, in order to make 300 grams of sugar water containing 150 grams of sugar, we need to pour exactly 150 grams of water into the beaker, which is impossible.\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Input 317 19 22 26 55 2802\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Output 32634 934"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}
