Riffle shuffle is one such example.  The following is how to perform riffle shuffle.\n\n\n  There is a deck of n cards.  First, we divide it into two decks; deck A which consists of the top half of it and deck B of the bottom half.  Deck A will have one more card when n is odd. \n\n\n  Next, c cards are pulled from bottom of deck A and are stacked on deck C, which is empty initially.  Then c cards are pulled from bottom of deck B and stacked on deck C, likewise.  This operation is repeated until deck A and B become empty.  When the number of cards of deck A(B) is less than c, all cards are pulled.\n  Finally we obtain shuffled deck C.

The cursor can also point out the end-of-line in a blank line.\n\n\nIn addition, the editor has a buffer which can hold either a string (a sequence of characters) or a linefeed.\n\n\nThe editor accepts the following set of commands (If the corresponding line is a blank line, the word \"the first character\" should be \"the end-of-line\"):\n\n\n\na\nMove the cursor to the first character of the current line.\n\n\ne\nMove the cursor to the end-of-line of the current line.\n\n\np\nMove the cursor to the first character of the next upper line, if it exists.\nIf there is no line above the current line, move the cursor to the first character of the current line.\n\n\nn\nMove the cursor to the first character of the next lower line, if it exists.\nIf there is no line below the current line, move the cursor to the first character of the current line.\n\n\nf\nMove the cursor by one character to the right, unless the cursor points out the end-of-line.\nIf the cursor points out the end-of-line and there is a line below the current line, move the cursor to the first character of the next lower line. Otherwise, do nothing.\n\n\nb\nMove the cursor by one character to the left, unless the cursor points out the first character.\nIf the cursor points out the first character and there is a line above the current line, move the cursor to the end-of-line of the next upper line. Otherwise, do nothing.\n\n\nd\nIf the cursor points out a character, delete the character (Characters and end-of-line next to the deleted character are shifted to the left).\nIf the cursor points out the end-of-line and there is a line below, the next lower line is appended to the end-of-line of the current line (Lines below the current line are shifted to the upper). Otherwise, do nothing.\n\n\nk\nIf the cursor points out the end-of-line and there is a line below the current line, perform the command d mentioned above, and record a linefeed on the buffer.\nIf the cursor does not point out the end-of-line, cut characters between the cursor (inclusive) and the end-of-line, and record them on the buffer.  After this operation, the cursor indicates the end-of-line of the current line.\n\n\ny\nIf the buffer is empty, do nothing.\nIf the buffer is holding a linefeed, insert the linefeed at the cursor. The cursor moves to the first character of the new line.\nIf the buffer is holding characters, insert the characters at the cursor. The cursor moves to the character or end-of-line which is originally pointed by the cursor.\n\n\n\nThe cursor position just after reading the text is the beginning of the first line, and the initial buffer is empty.\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of only one data-set which includes two parts. The first part gives a text consisting of several lines. The end of the text is indicated by a line (without quotes):\n\n\n\"END_OF_TEXT\"\n\n\nThis line should not be included in the text.\n\n\nNext part gives a series of commands.
