You are joining ICPC as an engineer, and you are responsible\nfor designing a protocol between clients and the game server for this system. As bandwidth assigned for\nthe server is quite limited, data size exchanged between clients and the server should be reduced as much\nas possible. In addition, all clients should be well synchronized during the quiz session for a simultaneous\nplay. In particular, much attention should be paid to the delay on receiving packets.\n\n\nTo verify that your protocol meets the above demands, you have decided to simulate the communication\nbetween clients and the server and calculate the data size exchanged during one game.\n\n\nA game has the following process. First, players participating and problems to be used are fixed. All\nplayers are using the same client program and already have the problem statements downloaded, so you\ndon\u2019t need to simulate this part. Then the game begins. The first problem is presented to the players,\nand the players answer it within a fixed amount of time. After that, the second problem is presented,\nand so forth. When all problems have been completed, the game ends. During each problem phase,\nthe players are notified of what other players have done. Before you submit your answer, you can know\nwho have already submitted their answers. After you have submitted your answer, you can know what\nanswers are submitted by other players.\n\n\nWhen each problem phase starts, the server sends a synchronization packet for problem-start to all the\nplayers, and begins a polling process. Every 1,000 milliseconds after the beginning of polling, the server\nchecks whether it received new answers from the players strictly before that moment, and if there are\nany, sends a notification to all the players:\n\n\n If a player hasn\u2019t submitted an answer yet, the server sends it a notification packet type A describing\n  others\u2019 answers about the newly received answers.\n If a player is one of those who submitted the newly received answers, the server sends it a notification\n  packet type B describing others\u2019 answers about all the answers submitted by other players (i.e.\n  excluding the player him/herself\u2019s answer) strictly before that moment.\n If a player has already submitted an answer, the server sends it a notification packet type B describing\n  others\u2019 answers about the newly received answers.\n Note that, in all above cases, notification packets (both types A and B) must contain information\n  about at least one player, and otherwise a notification packet will not be sent.\n\n\n\nWhen 20,000 milliseconds have passed after sending the synchronization packet for problem-start, the\nserver sends notification packets of type A or B if needed, and then sends a synchronization packet for\nproblem-end to all the players, to terminate the problem.\n\n\nOn the other hand, players will be able to answer the problem after receiving the synchronization packet\nfor problem-start and before receiving the synchronization packet for problem-end. Answers will be sent\nusing an answer packet.\n\n\nThe packets referred above have the formats shown by the following tables.\n\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case begins with a line consisting of two integers\nM and N (1 \u2264 M, N \u2264 100), denoting the number of players and problems, respectively. The next\nline contains M non-negative integers D0 , D1 , . . . , DM - 1 , denoting the communication delay between\neach players and the server (players are assigned ID\u2019s ranging from 0 to M - 1, inclusive). Then follow\nN blocks describing the submissions for each problem. Each block begins with a line containing an\ninteger L, denoting the number of players that submitted an answer for that problem. Each of the\nfollowing L lines gives the answer from one player, described by three fields P, T, and A separated by a\nwhitespace. Here P is an integer denoting the player ID, T is an integer denoting the time elapsed from the reception of synchronization packet for problem-start and the submission on the player\u2019s side, and A\nis an alphanumeric string denoting the player\u2019s answer, whose length is between 1 and 9, inclusive. Those\nL lines may be given in an arbitrary order. You may assume that all answer packets will be received by\nthe server within 19,999 milliseconds (inclusive) after sending synchronization packet for problem-start.\n\n\nThe input is terminated by a line containing two zeros.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, you are to print M + 1 lines. In the first line, print the data size sent and received\nby the server, separated by a whitespace. In the next M lines, print the data size sent and received by\neach player, separated by a whitespace, in ascending order of player ID.

In particular, much attention should be paid to the delay on receiving packets.\n\n\nTo verify that your protocol meets the above demands, you have decided to simulate the communication\nbetween clients and the server and calculate the data size exchanged during one game.\n\n\nA game has the following process. First, players participating and problems to be used are fixed. All\nplayers are using the same client program and already have the problem statements downloaded, so you\ndon\u2019t need to simulate this part. Then the game begins. The first problem is presented to the players,\nand the players answer it within a fixed amount of time. After that, the second problem is presented,\nand so forth. When all problems have been completed, the game ends. During each problem phase,\nthe players are notified of what other players have done. Before you submit your answer, you can know\nwho have already submitted their answers. After you have submitted your answer, you can know what\nanswers are submitted by other players.\n\n\nWhen each problem phase starts, the server sends a synchronization packet for problem-start to all the\nplayers, and begins a polling process. Every 1,000 milliseconds after the beginning of polling, the server\nchecks whether it received new answers from the players strictly before that moment, and if there are\nany, sends a notification to all the players:\n\n\n If a player hasn\u2019t submitted an answer yet, the server sends it a notification packet type A describing\n  others\u2019 answers about the newly received answers.\n If a player is one of those who submitted the newly received answers, the server sends it a notification\n  packet type B describing others\u2019 answers about all the answers submitted by other players (i.e.\n  excluding the player him/herself\u2019s answer) strictly before that moment.\n If a player has already submitted an answer, the server sends it a notification packet type B describing\n  others\u2019 answers about the newly received answers.\n Note that, in all above cases, notification packets (both types A and B) must contain information\n  about at least one player, and otherwise a notification packet will not be sent.\n\n\n\nWhen 20,000 milliseconds have passed after sending the synchronization packet for problem-start, the\nserver sends notification packets of type A or B if needed, and then sends a synchronization packet for\nproblem-end to all the players, to terminate the problem.\n\n\nOn the other hand, players will be able to answer the problem after receiving the synchronization packet\nfor problem-start and before receiving the synchronization packet for problem-end. Answers will be sent\nusing an answer packet.\n\n\nThe packets referred above have the formats shown by the following tables.\n\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case begins with a line consisting of two integers\nM and N (1 \u2264 M, N \u2264 100), denoting the number of players and problems, respectively. The next\nline contains M non-negative integers D0 , D1 , . . . , DM - 1 , denoting the communication delay between\neach players and the server (players are assigned ID\u2019s ranging from 0 to M - 1, inclusive). Then follow\nN blocks describing the submissions for each problem. Each block begins with a line containing an\ninteger L, denoting the number of players that submitted an answer for that problem. Each of the\nfollowing L lines gives the answer from one player, described by three fields P, T, and A separated by a\nwhitespace. Here P is an integer denoting the player ID, T is an integer denoting the time elapsed from the reception of synchronization packet for problem-start and the submission on the player\u2019s side, and A\nis an alphanumeric string denoting the player\u2019s answer, whose length is between 1 and 9, inclusive. Those\nL lines may be given in an arbitrary order. You may assume that all answer packets will be received by\nthe server within 19,999 milliseconds (inclusive) after sending synchronization packet for problem-start.\n\n\nThe input is terminated by a line containing two zeros.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, you are to print M + 1 lines. In the first line, print the data size sent and received\nby the server, separated by a whitespace. In the next M lines, print the data size sent and received by\neach player, separated by a whitespace, in ascending order of player ID. Print a blank line between two\nconsecutive test cases.\n\nSample Input\n\n3 2\n1 2 10\n3\n0 3420 o\n1 4589 o\n2 4638 x\n3\n1 6577 SUZUMIYA\n2 7644 SUZUMIYA\n0 19979 YASUZUMI\n4 2\n150 150 150 150\n4\n0 1344 HOGEHOGE\n1 1466 HOGEHOGE\n2 1789 HOGEHOGE\n3 19100 GEHO\n2\n2 1200 SETTEN\n3 700 SETTEN\n0 0\n\nOutput for the Sample Input\n\n177 57\n19 58\n19 57\n19 62\n\n253 70\n13 58\n13 58\n24 66\n20 71"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

You are now thinking of making the\nmost efficient schedule, i.e. the schedule for all orders being filled in the shortest days, using the program\nyou are going to write.\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of a series of test cases. Each case begins with a line containing a single integer N\nwhich represents the number of ordered tools.\n\n\nThen N lines follow, each specifying an order by four elements separated by one or more space: name,\nday1, sup and day2. name is the name of the tool in the corresponding order. day1 is the number of\nrequired days to make the tool without any support tool. sup is the name of the tool that can support\ncarving the target tool. day2 is the number of required days make the tool with the corresponding support\ntool.\n\n\nThe input terminates with the case where N = 0. You should not process this case.\n\n\nYou can assume that the input follows the constraints below:\n\n\n N \u2264 1000;\n name consists of no longer than 32 non-space characters, and is unique in each case;\n sup is one of all names given in the same case; and\n 0 < day2 < day1 < 20000.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing an integer which represents the minimum number of\ndays required to fill all N orders.\n\n\nSample Input\n\n3\ngu 20 pa 10\nci 20 gu 10\npa 20 ci 10\n2\ntool 20 tool 10\nproduct 1000 tool 10\n8\nfishhook  21 disk     3\nmill      14 axe      7\nboomerang 56 sundial 28\nflint     35 fishhook 5\naxe       35 flint   14\ndisk      42 disk     2\nsundial   14 disk     7\nhammer    28 mill     7\n0\n\nOutput for the Sample Input\n\n40\n30\n113"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Although there are various dialects of MML, all of them provide a set of commands to describe\nscores, such as commands for notes, rests, octaves, volumes, and so forth.\n\n\nIn this problem, we focus on rests, i.e. intervals of silence. Each rest command consists of a\ncommand specifier \u2018R\u2019 followed by a duration specifier.

Each department covers a wide range of products. For example, the department of disks\nand storages develops internal and external hard disk drives, USB thumb drives, solid-state\ndrives, and so on. This situation brings staff in the product management division difficulty\ncategorizing these numerous products because of their poor understanding of computer devices.\n\n\nOne day, a staff member suggested a tree-based diagram named a category diagram in order to\nmake their tasks easier. A category diagram is depicted as follows. Firstly, they prepare one\nlarge sheet of paper. Secondly, they write down the names of the development departments\non the upper side of the sheet. These names represent the start nodes of the diagram. Each\nstart node is connected to either a single split node or a single end node (these nodes will be\nmentioned soon later). Then they write down a number of questions that distinguish features\nof products in the middle, and these questions represent the split nodes of the diagram. Each\nsplit node is connected with other split nodes and end nodes, and each line from a split node\nis labeled with the answer to the question. Finally, they write down all category names on the\nlower side, which represents the end nodes.\n\n\nThe classification of each product is done like the following. They begin with the start node that\ncorresponds to the department developing the product. Visiting some split nodes, they traces\nthe lines down until they reach one of the end nodes labeled with a category name. Then they\nfind the product classified into the resultant category.\n\n\nThe visual appearance of a category diagram makes the diagram quite understandable even for\nnon-geek persons. However, product managers are not good at drawing the figures by hand, so\nmost of the diagrams were often messy due to many line crossings. For this reason, they hired\nyou, a talented programmer, to obtain the clean diagrams equivalent to their diagrams. Here,\nwe mean the clean diagrams as those with no line crossings.\n\n\nYour task is to write a program that finds the clean diagrams. For simplicity, we simply ignore\nthe questions of the split nodes, and use integers from 1 to N instead of the category names.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset follows the format below:\n\n\n     N M Q\n     split node info1\n     split node info2\n     ...\n     split node infoM\n     query1\n     query2\n     ...\n     queryQ\n\n\nThe first line of each dataset contains three integers N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 100000), M (0 \u2264 M \u2264 N - 1),\nand Q (1 \u2264 Q \u2264 1000, Q \u2264 N), representing the number of end nodes and split nodes, and the\nnumber of queries respectively. Then M lines describing the split nodes follow. Each split node\nis described in the format below:\n\n\n      Y L label1 label2 . . .\n\n\nThe first two integers, Y (0 \u2264 Y \u2264 109 ) and L, which indicates the y-coordinate where the\nsplit node locates (the smaller is the higher) and the size of a label list. After that, L integer\nnumbers of end node labels which directly or indirectly connected to the split node follow. This\nis a key information for node connections. A split node A is connected to another split node B\nif and only if both A and B refer (at least) one identical end node in their label lists, and the\ny-coordinate of B is the lowest of all split nodes referring identical end nodes and located below\nA. The split node is connected to the end node if and only if that is the lowest node among all\nnodes which contain the same label as the end node\u2019s label.
