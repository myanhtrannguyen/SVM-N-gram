For example, if we insert $n$ elements into a binary search tree in ascending order, the tree become a list, leading to long search times. One of strategies is to randomly shuffle the elements to be inserted. However, we should consider to maintain the balanced binary tree where different operations can be performed one by one depending on requirement.\n\n\n  We can maintain the balanced binary search tree by assigning a priority randomly selected to each node and by ordering nodes based on the following properties. Here, we assume that all priorities are distinct and also that all keys are distinct.\n\n\nbinary-search-tree property. If $v$ is a left child of $u$, then $v.key < u.key$ and if $v$ is a right child of $u$, then $u.key < v.key$\nheap property. If $v$ is a child of $u$, then $v.priority < u.priority$\n\n\n  This combination of properties is why the tree is called Treap (tree + heap).\n\n\n  An example of Treap is shown in the following figure.\n\n\n\nInsert\n  To insert a new element into a Treap, first of all, insert a node which a randomly selected priority value is assigned in the same way for ordinal binary search tree. For example, the following figure shows the Treap after a node with key = 6 and priority = 90 is inserted.\n\n\n\nIt is clear that this Treap violates the heap property, so we need to modify the structure of the tree by rotate operations. The rotate operation is to change parent-child relation while maintaing the binary-search-tree property.\n\n\n\n  The rotate operations can be implemented as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\nrightRotate(Node t)\n    Node s = t.left\n    t.left = s.right\n    s.right = t\n    return s // the new root of subtree\n\n\n\n\nleftRotate(Node t)\n    Node s = t.right\n    t.right = s.left\n    s.left = t\n    return s // the new root of subtree\n\n\n\n\n\n  The following figure shows processes of the rotate operations after the insert operation to maintain the properties.\n\n\n\n  The insert operation with rotate operations can be implemented as follows.\n\n\ninsert(Node t, int key, int priority)            // search the corresponding place recursively\n    if t == NIL\n        return Node(key, priority)               // create a new node when you reach a leaf\n    if key == t.key\n        return t                                 // ignore duplicated keys\n\n    if key < t.key                               // move to the left child\n        t.left = insert(t.left, key, priority)   // update the pointer to the left child\n        if t.priority < t.left.priority          // rotate right if the left child has higher priority\n            t = rightRotate(t)\n    else                                         // move to the right child\n        t.right = insert(t.right, key, priority) // update the pointer to the right child\n        if t.priority < t.right.priority         // rotate left if the right child has higher priority\n            t = leftRotate(t)\n\n  return t\n\n\nDelete\n  To delete a node from the Treap, first of all, the target node should be moved until it becomes a leaf by rotate operations.

If $v$ is a child of $u$, then $v.priority < u.priority$\n\n\n  This combination of properties is why the tree is called Treap (tree + heap).\n\n\n  An example of Treap is shown in the following figure.\n\n\n\nInsert\n  To insert a new element into a Treap, first of all, insert a node which a randomly selected priority value is assigned in the same way for ordinal binary search tree. For example, the following figure shows the Treap after a node with key = 6 and priority = 90 is inserted.\n\n\n\nIt is clear that this Treap violates the heap property, so we need to modify the structure of the tree by rotate operations. The rotate operation is to change parent-child relation while maintaing the binary-search-tree property.\n\n\n\n  The rotate operations can be implemented as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\nrightRotate(Node t)\n    Node s = t.left\n    t.left = s.right\n    s.right = t\n    return s // the new root of subtree\n\n\n\n\nleftRotate(Node t)\n    Node s = t.right\n    t.right = s.left\n    s.left = t\n    return s // the new root of subtree\n\n\n\n\n\n  The following figure shows processes of the rotate operations after the insert operation to maintain the properties.\n\n\n\n  The insert operation with rotate operations can be implemented as follows.\n\n\ninsert(Node t, int key, int priority)            // search the corresponding place recursively\n    if t == NIL\n        return Node(key, priority)               // create a new node when you reach a leaf\n    if key == t.key\n        return t                                 // ignore duplicated keys\n\n    if key < t.key                               // move to the left child\n        t.left = insert(t.left, key, priority)   // update the pointer to the left child\n        if t.priority < t.left.priority          // rotate right if the left child has higher priority\n            t = rightRotate(t)\n    else                                         // move to the right child\n        t.right = insert(t.right, key, priority) // update the pointer to the right child\n        if t.priority < t.right.priority         // rotate left if the right child has higher priority\n            t = leftRotate(t)\n\n  return t\n\n\nDelete\n  To delete a node from the Treap, first of all, the target node should be moved until it becomes a leaf by rotate operations. Then, you can remove the node (the leaf).
