The upper left tile corresponds to (0, 0).\n\n\nThe following figure shows an example of the input:\n\n\n10 10\n>>>v..>>>v\n...v..^..v\n...>>>^..v\n.........v\n.v<<<<...v\n.v...^...v\n.v...^<<<<\n.v........\n.v...^....\n.>>>>^....\n\n\nCharacters represent tiles as follows:\n\n\n'>': Tile with a east-pointing arrow\n'<': Tile with a west-pointing arrow \n'^': Tile with a north-pointing arrow \n'v': Tile with a south-pointing arrow \n'.': Tile with nothing\n\n\nIf the person goes in cycles forever, your program should print \"LOOP\". You may assume that the person never goes outside of the room.\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of multiple datasets. The input ends with a line which contains two 0. Each dataset consists of:\n\n\nH W\nH lines where each line contains W characters\n\n\nYou can assume that 0 < W, H < 101.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each dataset, print the coordinate (X, Y) of the person or \"LOOP\" in a line. X and Y should be separated by a space.\n\nSample Input\n\n10 10\n>>>v..>>>v\n...v..^..v\n>>>>>>^..v\n.........v\n.v<<<<...v\n.v.v.^...v\n.v.v.^<<<<\n.v.v.....v\n.v...^...v\n.>>>>^....\n6 10\n>>>>>>>>>v\n.........v\n.........v\n>>>>v....v\n^...v....v\n^<<<<<<<<<\n0 0\n\nOutput for the Sample Input\n\n5 7\nLOOP"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}
