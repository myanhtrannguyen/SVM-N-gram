As the number of users has grown, in order to meet the needs of more users, AtCoder has decided to increase the number of contests to 26 types, from AAC to AZC. For convenience, we number these 26 types as type 1 through type 26. AtCoder wants to schedule contests for D days so that user satisfaction is as high as possible. For every day, AtCoder will hold exactly one contest, and each contest will end on that day. The satisfaction is calculated as follows.\n\nThe satisfaction at the beginning of day 1 is 0. Satisfaction can be negative.\nHolding contests increases satisfaction. The amount of increase will vary depending on a variety of factors. Specifically, we know in advance that holding a contest of type i on day d will increase the satisfaction by s_{d,i}.\nIf a particular type of contest is not held for a while, the satisfaction decreases. Each contest type i has an integer c_i, and at the end of each day d=1,2,...,D, the satisfaction decreases as follows. Let \\mathrm{last}(d,i) be the last day before day d (including d) on which a contest of type i was held. If contests of type i have never been held yet, we define \\mathrm{last}(d,i)=0.

The maximum score you can get by solving this problem C is 1, which will have almost no effect on your ranking.)\n\n\nBeginner's Guide\"Local search\" is a powerful method for finding a high-quality solution.\nIn this method, instead of constructing a solution from scratch, we try to find a better solution by slightly modifying the already found solution.\nIf the solution gets better, update it, and if it gets worse, restore it.\nBy repeating this process, the quality of the solution is gradually improved over time.\nThe pseudo-code is as follows.\nsolution = compute an initial solution (by random generation, or by applying other methods such as greedy)\nwhile the remaining time > 0:\n    slightly modify the solution (randomly)\n    if the solution gets worse:\n        restore the solution\n\nFor example, in this problem, we can use the following modification: pick the date d and contest type q at random and change the type of contest to be held on day d to q.\nThe pseudo-code is as follows.\nt[1..D] = compute an initial solution (by random generation, or by applying other methods such as greedy)\nwhile the remaining time > 0:\n    pick d and q at random\n    old = t[d] # Remember the original value so that we can restore it later\n    t[d] = q\n    if the solution gets worse:\n        t[d] = old\n\nThe most important thing when using the local search method is the design of how to modify solutions.\n\nIf the amount of modification is too small, we will soon fall into a dead-end (local optimum) and, conversely, if the amount of modification is too large, the probability of finding an improving move becomes extremely small.\nIn order to increase the number of iterations, it is desirable to be able to quickly calculate the score after applying a modification.\n\nIn this problem C, we focus on the second point.\nThe score after the modification can, of course, be obtained by calculating the score from scratch.\nHowever, by focusing on only the parts that have been modified, it may be possible to quickly compute the difference between the scores before and after the modification.\nFrom another viewpoint, the impossibility of such a fast incremental calculation implies that a small modification to the solution affects a majority of the score calculation.\nIn such a case, we may need to redesign how to modify solutions, or there is a high possibility that the problem is not suitable for local search.\nLet's implement fast incremental score computation.\nIt's time to demonstrate the skills of algorithms and data structures you have developed in ABC and ARC!\nIn this kind of contest, where the objective is to find a better solution instead of the optimal one, a bug in a program does not result in a wrong answer, which may delay the discovery of the bug.\nFor early detection of bugs, it is a good idea to unit test functions you implemented complicated routines.\nFor example, if you implement fast incremental score calculation, it is a good idea to test that the scores computed by the fast implementation match the scores computed from scratch, as we will do in this problem C.\n\n\n\n\nProblem StatementYou will be given a contest schedule for D days and M queries of schedule modification.\nIn the i-th query, given integers d_i and q_i, change the type of contest to be held on day d_i to q_i, and then output the final satisfaction at the end of day D on the updated schedule.\nNote that we do not revert each query. That is, the i-th query is applied to the new schedule obtained by the (i-1)-th query.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInputInput is given from Standard Input in the form of the input of Problem A followed by the output of Problem A and the queries.\nD\nc_1 c_2 \\cdots c_{26}\ns_{1,1} s_{1,2} \\cdots s_{1,26}\n\\vdots\ns_{D,1} s_{D,2} \\cdots s_{D,26}\nt_1\nt_2\n\\vdots\nt_D\nM\nd_1 q_1\nd_2 q_2\n\\vdots\nd_M q_M\n\n\nThe constraints and generation methods for the input part are the same as those for Problem A.\nFor each d=1,\\ldots,D, t_d is an integer generated independently and uniformly at random from {1,2,\\ldots,26}.\nThe number of queries M is an integer satisfying 1\\leq M\\leq 10^5.\nFor each i=1,\\ldots,M, d_i is an integer generated independently and uniformly at random from {1,2,\\ldots,D}.\nFor each i=1,\\ldots,26, q_i is an integer satisfying 1\\leq q_i\\leq 26 generated uniformly at random from the 25 values that differ from the type of contest on day d_i.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutputLet v_i be the final satisfaction at the end of day D on the schedule after applying the i-th query.\nPrint M integers v_i to Standard Output in the following format:\nv_1\nv_2\n\\vdots\nv_M\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Input 15\n86 90 69 51 2 96 71 47 88 34 45 46 89 34 31 38 97 84 41 80 14 4 50 83 7 82\n19771 12979 18912 10432 10544 12928 13403 3047 10527 9740 8100 92 2856 14730 1396 15905 6534 4650 11469 3628 8433 2994 10899 16396 18355 11424\n6674 17707 13855 16407 12232 2886 11908 1705 5000 1537 10440 10711 4917 10770 17272 15364 19277 18094 3929 3705 7169 6159 18683 15410 9092 4570\n6878 4239 19925 1799 375 9563 3445 5658 19857 11401 6997 6498 19933 3848 2426 2146 19745 16880 17773 18359 3921 14172 16730 11157 5439 256\n8633 15862 15303 10749 18499 7792 10317 5901 9395 11433 3514 3959 5202 19850 19469 9790 5653 784 18500 10552 17975 16615 7852 197 8471 7452\n19855 17918 7990 10572 4333 438 9140 9104 12622 4985 12319 4028 19922 12132 16259 17476 2976 547 19195 19830 16285 4806 4471 9457 2864 2192\n1\n17\n13\n14\n13\n5\n1 7\n4 11\n3 4\n5 24\n4 19\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Output 172882\n56634\n38425\n27930\n42884\n\nNote that this example is a small one for checking the problem specification.

By considering why it is not good, let's improve the modification operation.\nOne of the most powerful and widely used variant of the local search method is \"Simulated Annealing (SA)\", which makes it easier to reach a better solution by stochastically accepting worsening moves.\nFor more information about SA and other local search techniques, please refer to the editorial that will be published after the contest."}], "max_tokens": 2048}}
