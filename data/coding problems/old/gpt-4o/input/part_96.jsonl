Here, if s_i is o, the animal said that the two neighboring animals are of the same species, and if s_i is x, the animal said that the two neighboring animals are of different species.\nMore formally, a sheep answered o if the two neighboring animals are both sheep or both wolves, and answered x otherwise.\nSimilarly, a wolf answered x if the two neighboring animals are both sheep or both wolves, and answered o otherwise.\nSnuke is wondering whether there is a valid assignment of species to the animals that is consistent with these responses. If there is such an assignment, show one such assignment. Otherwise, print -1.\n\n\n\n\nConstraints\n3 \u2264 N \u2264 10^{5}\ns is a string of length N consisting of o and x.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInputThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\ns\n\n\n\n\n\nOutputIf there does not exist an valid assignment that is consistent with s, print -1.\nOtherwise, print an string t in the following format. The output is considered correct if the assignment described by t is consistent with s.\n\nt is a string of length N consisting of S and W.\nIf t_i is S, it indicates that the animal numbered i is a sheep. If t_i is W, it indicates that the animal numbered i is a wolf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Input 16\nooxoox\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Output 1SSSWWS\n\nFor example, if the animals numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are respectively a sheep, sheep, sheep, wolf, wolf, and sheep, it is consistent with their responses. Besides, there is another valid assignment of species: a wolf, sheep, wolf, sheep, wolf and wolf.\nLet us remind you: if the neiboring animals are of the same species, a sheep answers o and a wolf answers x. If the neiboring animals are of different species, a sheep answers x and a wolf answers o.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Input 23\noox\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Output 2-1\n\nPrint -1 if there is no valid assignment of species.\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Input 310\noxooxoxoox\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Output 3SSWWSSSWWS"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}
