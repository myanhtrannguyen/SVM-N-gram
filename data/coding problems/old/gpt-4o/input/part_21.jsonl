The stack must be empty when this instruction is called.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Instruction Set for the Machine Y\n\n\nA sufficient number of values must exist in the stack on execution of every instruction. In addition, due to the\nlimitation of the machine Y, no more values can be pushed when the stack already stores as many as 256 values.\nAlso, there exist several restrictions on values to be pushed onto the stack:\n\n\n For rational numbers, neither numerator nor denominator in the irreducible form may exceed 32,768 in its absolute value.\n For any element in X of the form q\u221ar = (a/b)\u221ar, |a\u221ar| \u2264 32,768 and |b| \u2264 32,768.\n For any element in X*, each term in the sum must satisfy the above conditions.\n\n\nThe rules for the string representations of the values (on the machine Y) are as follows:\n\n\n A rational number is represented as either an integer or an irreducible fraction with a denominator greater\n  than 1. A fraction is represented as \"<numerator>/<denominator>\". A sign symbol - precedes in case of a negative number.\n A number of the form q\u221ar is represented as \"<string representation of q>*sqrt(r)\" except for the case\n  with q = \u00b11, in which the number is represented as \"sqrt(r)\" (q = 1) or \"-sqrt(r)\" (q = -1).\n For the sum of two or more elements of X, string representations of all the (non-zero) elements are con-\n  nected using the binary operator +. In this case, all terms with the same rooted number are merged into a\n  single term, and the terms must be shown in the ascending order of its root component. For the purpose of\n  this rule, all rational numbers are regarded to accompany \u221a1.\n There is exactly one space character before and after each of the binary operator +. No space character appears at any other place.\n\n\nThe followings are a few examples of valid string representations:\n\n\n0\n1\n-1/10\n2*sqrt(2) + 1/2*sqrt(3) + -1/2*sqrt(5)\n1/2 + sqrt(10) + -sqrt(30)\n\n\nYour task is to write a program that simulates the machine Y.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is a sequence of instructions. Each line contains a single instruction. You may assume that every\ninstruction is called in a legal way. The instruction stop appears only once, at the end of the entire input.\n\n\nOutput\n\nOutput the strings which the machine Y will display.
