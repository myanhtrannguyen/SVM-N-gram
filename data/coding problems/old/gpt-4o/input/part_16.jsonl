Each kind of resource has a certain number of instances. A process has to acquire resource instances for its execution. The number of required instances of a resource kind depends on a process. A process finishes its execution and terminates eventually after all the resource in need are acquired. These resource instances are released then so that other processes can use them. No process releases instances before its termination. Processes keep trying to acquire resource instances in need, one by one, without taking account of behavior of other processes. Since processes run independently of others, they may sometimes become unable to finish their execution because of deadlock.\n\n\nA process has to wait when no more resource instances in need are available until some other processes release ones on their termination. Deadlock is a situation in which two or more processes wait for termination of each other, and, regrettably, forever. This happens with the following scenario: One process A acquires the sole instance of resource X, and another process B acquires the sole instance of another resource Y; after that, A tries to acquire an instance of Y, and B tries to acquire an instance of X. As there are no instances of Y other than one acquired by B, A will never acquire Y before B finishes its execution, while B will never acquire X before A finishes. There may be more complicated deadlock situations involving three or more processes.\n\n\nYour task is, receiving the system's resource allocation time log (from the system's start to a certain time), to determine when the system fell into a deadlock-unavoidable state. Deadlock may usually be avoided by an appropriate allocation order, but deadlock-unavoidable states are those in which some resource allocation has already been made and no allocation order from then on can ever avoid deadlock.\n\n\n  Let us consider an example corresponding to Sample Input 1 below. The system has two kinds of resource $R_1$ and $R_2$, and two processes $P_1$ and $P_2$. The system has three instances of $R_1$ and four instances of $R_2$. Process $P_1$ needs three instances of $R_1$ and two instances of $R_2$ to finish its execution, while process $P_2$ needs a single instance of $R_1$ and three instances of $R_2$. The resource allocation time log is given as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt time 4, $P_2$ acquired $R_1$ and the number of available instances of $R_1$ became less than $P_1$'s need of $R_1$. Therefore, it became necessary for $P_1$ to wait $P_2$ to terminate and release the instance. However, at time 5, $P_1$ acquired $R_2$ necessary for $P_2$ to finish its execution, and thus it became necessary also for $P_2$ to wait $P_1$; the deadlock became unavoidable at this time.\n\n\nNote that the deadlock was still avoidable at time 4 by finishing $P_2$ first (Sample Input 2).\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of a single test case formatted as follows.\n\n\n$p$ $r$ $t$\n$l_1$ ... $l_r$\n$n_{1,1}$ ... $n_{1,r}$\n...\n$n_{p,1}$ ... $n_{p,r}$\n$P_1$ $R_1$\n...\n$P_t$ $R_t$\n\n\n$p$ is the number of processes, and is an integer between 2 and 300, inclusive. The processes are numbered 1 through $p$. $r$ is the number of resource kinds, and is an integer between 1 and 300, inclusive. The resource kinds are numbered 1 through $r$. $t$ is the length of the time log, and is an integer between 1 and 200,000, inclusive. $l_j$ $(1 \\leq j \\leq r)$ is the number of initially available instances of the resource kind $j$, and is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive. $n_{i,j}$ $(1 \\leq i \\leq p, 1 \\leq j \\leq r)$ is the number of resource instances of the resource kind $j$ that the process $i$ needs, and is an integer between 0 and $l_j$ , inclusive.

Deadlock is a situation in which two or more processes wait for termination of each other, and, regrettably, forever.

Famous ones include \"dogeeseseegod\" (\"Do geese see God?\"), \"amoreroma\" (\"Amore, Roma.\") and \"risetovotesir\" (\"Rise to vote, sir.\").\n\n\nAn ancient sutra has been handed down through generations at a temple on Tsukuba foothills. They say the sutra was a palindrome, but some of the characters have been dropped through transcription.\n\n\nA famous scholar in the field of religious studies was asked to recover the original. After long repeated deliberations, he concluded that no information to recover the original has been lost, and that the original can be reconstructed as the shortest palindrome including all the characters of the current sutra in the same order. That is to say, the original sutra is obtained by adding some characters before, between, and/or behind the characters of the current.\n\n\nGiven a character sequence, your program should output one of the shortest palindromes containing the characters of the current sutra preserving their order. One of the shortest? Yes, more than one shortest palindromes may exist. Which of them to output is also specified as its rank among the candidates in the lexicographical order.\n\n\nFor example, if the current sutra is cdba and 7th is specified, your program should output cdabadc among the 8 candidates, abcdcba, abdcdba, acbdbca, acdbdca, cabdbac, cadbdac, cdabadc and cdbabdc.\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of a single test case.

One of the recent proposals is more flexible lathes in which not only the workpiece but also the cutter bit rotate around parallel axles in synchronization. When the lathe is switched on, the workpiece and the cutter bit start rotating at the same angular velocity, that is, to the same direction and at the same rotational speed. On collision with the cutter bit, parts of the workpiece that intersect with the cutter bit are cut out.\n\n\nTo show the usefulness of the mechanism, you are asked to simulate the cutting process by such a lathe.\n\n\nAlthough the workpiece and the cutter bit may have complex shapes, focusing on cross sections of them on a plane perpendicular to the spinning axles would suffice. We introduce an $xy$-coordinate system on a plane perpendicular to the two axles, in which the center of rotation of the workpiece is at the origin $(0, 0)$, while that of the cutter bit is at $(L, 0)$. You can assume both the workpiece and the cutter bit have polygonal cross sections, not necessarily convex.\n\n\nNote that, even when this cross section of the workpiece is divided into two or more parts, the workpiece remain undivided on other cross sections. \n\n\nWe refer to the lattice points (points with both $x$ and $y$ coordinates being integers) strictly inside, that is, inside and not on an edge, of the workpiece before the rotation as points of interest, or POI in short.\n\n\nOur interest is in how many POI will remain after one full rotation of 360 degrees of both the workpiece and the cutter bit. POI are said to remain if they are strictly inside the resultant workpiece. Write a program that counts them for the given workpiece and cutter bit configuration.\n\n\nFigure H.1(a) illustrates the workpiece (in black line) and the cutter bit (in blue line) given in Sample Input 1. Two circles indicate positions of the rotation centers of the workpiece and the cutter bit. The red cross-shaped marks indicate the POI.\n\n\nFigure H.1(b) illustrates the workpiece and the cutter bit in progress in case that the rotation direction is clockwise. The light blue area indicates the area cut-off.\n\n\nFigure H.1(c) illustrates the result of this sample. Note that one of POI is on the edge of the resulting shape. You should not count this point. There are eight POI remained.\n\n\n\n\nFigure H.1. The workpiece and the cutter bit in Sample 1\n\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of a single test case with the following format.\n\n\n$M$ $N$ $L$\n$x_{w1}$ $y_{w1}$\n...\n$x_{wM}$ $y_{wM}$\n$x_{c1}$ $y_{c1}$\n...\n$x_{cN}$ $y_{cN}$\n\n\nThe first line contains three integers. $M$ is the number of vertices of the workpiece $(4 \\leq M \\leq 20)$\nand $N$ is the number of vertices of the cutter bit $(4 \\leq N \\leq 20)$. $L$ specifies the position of the\nrotation center of the cutter bit $(1 \\leq L \\leq 10000)$.\n\n\nEach of the following $M$ lines contains two integers. The $i$-th line has $x_{wi}$ and $y_{wi}$, telling that the position of the $i$-th vertex of the workpiece has the coordinates $(x_{wi}, y_{wi})$. The vertices are given in the counter-clockwise order.\n\n\n$N$ more following lines are positions of the vertices of the cutter bit, in the same manner, but the coordinates are given as offsets from its center of rotation, $(L, 0)$. That is, the position of the $j$-th vertex of the cutter bit has the coordinates $(L + x_{cj} , y_{cj} )$.\n\n\nYou may assume $-10000 \\leq x_{wi}, y_{wi}, x_{cj} , y_{cj} \\leq 10000$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq M$ and $1 \\leq j \\leq N$.\n\n\nAll the edges of the workpiece and the cutter bit at initial rotation positions are parallel to the $x$-axis or the $y$-axis. In other words, for each $i$ $(1 \\leq i \\leq M), x_{wi} = x_{wi'}$ or $y_{wi} = y_{wi'}$ holds, where $i' = (i $ mod$ M) + 1$. Edges are parallel to the $x$- and the $y$-axes alternately. These can also be said about the cutter bit.\n\n\nYou may assume that the cross section of the workpiece forms a simple polygon, that is, no two edges have common points except for adjacent edges. The same can be said about the cutter bit. The workpiece and the cutter bit do not touch or overlap before starting the rotation.\n\n\nNote that $(0, 0)$ is not always inside the workpiece and $(L, 0)$ is not always inside the cutter bit.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput the number of POI remaining strictly inside the workpiece.\n\nSample Input 1\n4 6 5\n-2 5\n-2 -1\n2 -1\n2 5\n-2 1\n-2 0\n0 0\n0 -2\n2 -2\n2 1\nSample Output 1\n8\nSample Input 2\n14 14 6000\n-3000 3000\n-3000 -3000\n3000 -3000\n3000 -2000\n2000 -2000\n2000 -1000\n1000 -1000\n1000 0\n0 0\n0 1000\n-1000 1000\n-1000 2000\n-2000 2000\n-2000 3000\n3000 3000\n-3000 3000\n-3000 2000\n-2000 2000\n-2000 1000\n-1000 1000\n-1000 0\n0 0\n0 -1000\n1000 -1000\n1000 -2000\n2000 -2000\n2000 -3000\n3000 -3000\nSample Output 2\n6785772\nSample Input 3\n12 12 11\n-50 45\n-50 -45\n40 -45\n40 25\n-10 25\n-10 -5\n0 -5\n0 15\n30 15\n30 -35\n-40 -35\n-40 45\n50 -45\n50 45\n-40 45\n-40 -25\n10 -25\n10 5\n0 5\n0 -15\n-30 -15\n-30 35\n40 35\n40 -45\nSample Output 3\n966\nSample Input 4\n20 4 11\n-5 5\n-5 -10\n-4 -10\n-4 -1\n-3 -1\n-3 -10\n1 -10\n1 -4\n0 -4\n0 -1\n1 -1\n1 0\n4 0\n4 -1\n10 -1\n10 3\n1 3\n1 4\n10 4\n10 5\n0 0\n3 0\n3 3\n0 3\nSample Output 4\n64"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The delivery routes between post offices are described by a directed graph $G = (V,E)$, where $V$ is the set of post offices and $E$ is the set of possible mail forwarding steps. Due to the inefficient operations, you cannot expect that the mails are delivered along the shortest route.\n\n\nThe set of post offices can be divided into a certain number of groups. Here, a group is defined as a set of post offices where mails can be forwarded from any member of the group to any other member, directly or indirectly. The number of post offices in such a group does not exceed 10.\n\n\nThe post offices frequently receive complaints from customers that some mails are not delivered yet. Such a problem is usually due to system trouble in a single post office, but identifying which is not easy. Thus, when such complaints are received, the customer support sends staff to check the system of each candidate post office. Here, the investigation cost to check the system of the post office $u$ is given by $c_u$, which depends on the scale of the post office.\n\n\nSince there are many post offices in the country, and such complaints are frequently received, reducing the investigation cost is an important issue.

Each citizen will be identified by a five-digit SSN. Its first four digits indicate the basic ID number (0000 - 9999) and the last one digit is a check digit for detecting errors.\n\n\nFor computing check digits, the city has decided to use an operation table. An operation table is a 10 $\\times$ 10 table of decimal digits whose diagonal elements are all 0. Below are two example operation tables.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperation Table 1\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOperation Table 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing an operation table, the check digit $e$ for a four-digit basic ID number $abcd$ is computed by using the following formula. Here, $i \\otimes\n j$ denotes the table element at row $i$ and column $j$.\n\n\n$e = (((0 \\otimes a) \\otimes  b) \\otimes c) \\otimes d$\n\n\n\nFor example, by using Operation Table 1 the check digit $e$ for a basic ID number $abcd = $ 2016 is computed in the following way.\n\n\n$e = (((0 \\otimes 2) \\otimes 0) \\otimes 1) \\otimes 6$\n$\\;\\;\\;  = (( \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;  1 \\otimes 0) \\otimes 1) \\otimes 6$\n$\\;\\;\\;  = ( \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\; 7 \\otimes 1) \\otimes 6$\n$\\;\\;\\;  =  \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\; 9 \\otimes 6$\n$\\;\\;\\;  =  \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;  6$\n\n\nThus, the SSN is 20166.\n\n\nNote that the check digit depends on the operation table used. With Operation Table 2, we have $e = $ 3 for the same basic ID number 2016, and the whole SSN will be 20163.\n\n\n\nFigure B.1. Two kinds of common human errors\n\n\nThe purpose of adding the check digit is to detect human errors in writing/typing SSNs. The following check function can detect certain human errors. For a five-digit number $abcde$, the check function is defined as follows.\n\n\ncheck($abcde$) $ = ((((0 \\otimes a) \\otimes b) \\otimes c) \\otimes d) \\otimes e$\n\n\n\nThis function returns 0 for a correct SSN. This is because every diagonal element in an operation table is 0 and for a correct SSN we have $e = (((0 \\otimes a) \\otimes b) \\otimes c) \\otimes d$:\n\n\ncheck($abcde$) $ = ((((0 \\otimes a) \\otimes b) \\otimes c) \\otimes d) \\otimes e = e \\otimes e = 0$\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, a non-zero value returned by check indicates that the given number cannot be a correct SSN. Note that, depending on the operation table used, check function may return 0 for an incorrect SSN. Kinds of errors detected depends on the operation table used; the table decides the quality of error detection.\n\n\nThe city authority wants to detect two kinds of common human errors on digit sequences: altering one single digit and transposing two adjacent digits, as shown in Figure B.1. \n\n\nAn operation table is good if it can detect all the common errors of the two kinds on all SSNs made from four-digit basic ID numbers 0000{9999. Note that errors with the check digit, as well as with four basic ID digits, should be detected. For example, Operation Table 1 is good. Operation Table 2 is not good because, for 20613, which is a number obtained by transposing the 3rd and the 4th digits of a correct SSN 20163, check(20613) is 0. Actually, among 10000 basic ID numbers, Operation Table 2 cannot detect one or more common errors for as many as 3439 basic ID numbers.\n\n\nGiven an operation table, decide how good it is by counting the number of basic ID numbers for which the given table cannot detect one or more common errors.\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of a single test case of the following format.\n\n$x_{00}$ $x_{01}$ ... $x_{09}$\n...\n$x_{90}$ $x_{91}$ ... $x_{99}$\n\n\nThe input describes an operation table with $x_{ij}$ being the decimal digit at row $i$ and column $j$.

Here, $i \\otimes\n j$ denotes the table element at row $i$ and column $j$.\n\n\n$e = (((0 \\otimes a) \\otimes  b) \\otimes c) \\otimes d$\n\n\n\nFor example, by using Operation Table 1 the check digit $e$ for a basic ID number $abcd = $ 2016 is computed in the following way.\n\n\n$e = (((0 \\otimes 2) \\otimes 0) \\otimes 1) \\otimes 6$\n$\\;\\;\\;  = (( \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;  1 \\otimes 0) \\otimes 1) \\otimes 6$\n$\\;\\;\\;  = ( \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\; 7 \\otimes 1) \\otimes 6$\n$\\;\\;\\;  =  \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\; 9 \\otimes 6$\n$\\;\\;\\;  =  \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;  6$\n\n\nThus, the SSN is 20166.\n\n\nNote that the check digit depends on the operation table used. With Operation Table 2, we have $e = $ 3 for the same basic ID number 2016, and the whole SSN will be 20163.\n\n\n\nFigure B.1. Two kinds of common human errors\n\n\nThe purpose of adding the check digit is to detect human errors in writing/typing SSNs. The following check function can detect certain human errors. For a five-digit number $abcde$, the check function is defined as follows.\n\n\ncheck($abcde$) $ = ((((0 \\otimes a) \\otimes b) \\otimes c) \\otimes d) \\otimes e$\n\n\n\nThis function returns 0 for a correct SSN. This is because every diagonal element in an operation table is 0 and for a correct SSN we have $e = (((0 \\otimes a) \\otimes b) \\otimes c) \\otimes d$:\n\n\ncheck($abcde$) $ = ((((0 \\otimes a) \\otimes b) \\otimes c) \\otimes d) \\otimes e = e \\otimes e = 0$\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, a non-zero value returned by check indicates that the given number cannot be a correct SSN. Note that, depending on the operation table used, check function may return 0 for an incorrect SSN. Kinds of errors detected depends on the operation table used; the table decides the quality of error detection.\n\n\nThe city authority wants to detect two kinds of common human errors on digit sequences: altering one single digit and transposing two adjacent digits, as shown in Figure B.1. \n\n\nAn operation table is good if it can detect all the common errors of the two kinds on all SSNs made from four-digit basic ID numbers 0000{9999. Note that errors with the check digit, as well as with four basic ID digits, should be detected. For example, Operation Table 1 is good. Operation Table 2 is not good because, for 20613, which is a number obtained by transposing the 3rd and the 4th digits of a correct SSN 20163, check(20613) is 0. Actually, among 10000 basic ID numbers, Operation Table 2 cannot detect one or more common errors for as many as 3439 basic ID numbers.\n\n\nGiven an operation table, decide how good it is by counting the number of basic ID numbers for which the given table cannot detect one or more common errors.\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of a single test case of the following format.\n\n$x_{00}$ $x_{01}$ ... $x_{09}$\n...\n$x_{90}$ $x_{91}$ ... $x_{99}$\n\n\nThe input describes an operation table with $x_{ij}$ being the decimal digit at row $i$ and column $j$.

Next $m$ lines contain the information of doors.
