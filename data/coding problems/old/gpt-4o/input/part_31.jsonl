Davis has been running an electronic bulletin board system named JAG-channel. He is now having hard time to add a new feature there --- threaded view.\n\nLike many other bulletin board systems, JAG-channel is thread-based. Here a thread (also called a topic) refers to a single conversation with a collection of posts. Each post can be an opening post, which initiates a new thread, or a reply to a previous post in an existing thread.\n\nThreaded view is a tree-like view that reflects the logical reply structure among the posts: each post forms a node of the tree and contains its replies as its subnodes in the chronological order (i.e. older replies precede newer ones). Note that a post along with its direct and indirect replies forms a subtree as a whole.\n\nLet us take an example. Suppose: a user made an opening post with a message hoge; another user replied to it with fuga; yet another user also replied to the opening post with piyo; someone else replied to the second post (i.e. fuga\u201d) with foobar; and the fifth user replied to the same post with jagjag.\nThe tree of this thread would look like:\n\nhoge\n\u251c\u2500fuga\n\u2502\u3000\u251c\u2500foobar\n\u2502\u3000\u2514\u2500jagjag\n\u2514\u2500piyo\n\nFor easier implementation, Nathan is thinking of a simpler format: the depth of each post from the opening post is represented by dots. Each reply gets one more dot than its parent post. The tree of the above thread would then look like:\n\nhoge\n.fuga\n..foobar\n..jagjag\n.piyo\n\nYour task in this problem is to help Nathan by writing a program that prints a tree in the Nathan's format for the given posts in a single thread.\n\nInput\nInput contains a single dataset in the following format:\n\n\nn\nk_1\nM_1\nk_2\nM_2\n:\n:\nk_n\nM_n\n\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1,000), which is the number of posts in the thread.\nThen 2n lines follow.\nEach post is represented by two lines:\nthe first line contains an integer k_i (k_1 = 0, 1 \u2264 k_i < i for 2 \u2264 i \u2264 n) and indicates the i-th post is a reply to the k_i-th post;\nthe second line contains a string M_i and represents the message of the i-th post.\nk_1 is always 0, which means the first post is not replying to any other post, i.e. it is an opening post.\n\nEach message contains 1 to 50 characters, consisting of uppercase, lowercase, and numeric letters.\n\nOutput\nPrint the given n messages as specified in the problem statement.\n\nSample Input 1\n1\n0\nicpc\n\nOutput for the Sample Input 1\nicpc\n\nSample Input 2\n5\n0\nhoge\n1\nfuga\n1\npiyo\n2\nfoobar\n2\njagjag\n\nOutput for the Sample Input 2\nhoge\n.fuga\n..foobar\n..jagjag\n.piyo\n\nSample Input 3\n8\n0\njagjag\n1\nhogehoge\n1\nbuhihi\n2\nfugafuga\n4\nponyoponyo\n5\nevaeva\n4\nnowawa\n5\npokemon\n\nOutput for the Sample Input 3\njagjag\n.hogehoge\n..fugafuga\n...ponyoponyo\n....evaeva\n....pokemon\n...nowawa\n.buhihi\n\nSample Input 4\n6\n0\nnakachan\n1\nfan\n2\nyamemasu\n3\nnennryou2\n4\ndannyaku4\n5\nkouzai11\n\nOutput for the Sample Input 4\nnakachan\n.fan\n..yamemasu\n...nennryou2\n....dannyaku4\n.....kouzai11\n\nSample Input 5\n34\n0\nLoveLive\n1\nhonoka\n2\nborarara\n2\nsunohare\n2\nmogyu\n1\neri\n6\nkasikoi\n7\nkawaii\n8\neriichika\n1\nkotori\n10\nWR\n10\nhaetekurukotori\n10\nichigo\n1\numi\n14\nlove\n15\narrow\n16\nshoot\n1\nrin\n18\nnyanyanya\n1\nmaki\n20\n6th\n20\nstar\n22\nnishikino\n1\nnozomi\n24\nspiritual\n25\npower\n1\nhanayo\n27\ndarekatasukete\n28\nchottomattete\n1\nniko\n30\nnatsuiro\n30\nnikkonikkoni\n30\nsekaino\n33\nYAZAWA\n\nOutput for the Sample Input 5\nLoveLive\n.honoka\n..borarara\n..sunohare\n..mogyu\n.eri\n..kasikoi\n...kawaii\n....eriichika\n.kotori\n..WR\n..haetekurukotori\n..ichigo\n.umi\n..love\n...arrow\n....shoot\n.rin\n..nyanyanya\n.maki\n..6th\n..star\n...nishikino\n.nozomi\n..spiritual\n...power\n.hanayo\n..darekatasukete\n...chottomattete\n.niko\n..natsuiro\n..nikkonikkoni\n..sekaino\n...YAZAWA\n\nSample Input 6\n6\n0\n2ch\n1\n1ostu\n1\n2get\n1\n1otsu\n1\n1ostu\n3\npgr\n\nOutput for the Sample Input 6\n2ch\n.1ostu\n.2get\n..pgr\n.1otsu\n.1ostu"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Davis has been running an electronic bulletin board system named JAG-channel. He is now having hard time to add a new feature there --- threaded view.\n\nLike many other bulletin board systems, JAG-channel is thread-based. Here a thread (also called a topic) refers to a single conversation with a collection of posts. Each post can be an opening post, which initiates a new thread, or a reply to a previous post in an existing thread.\n\nThreaded view is a tree-like view that reflects the logical reply structure among the posts: each post forms a node of the tree and contains its replies as its subnodes in the chronological order (i.e. older replies precede newer ones). Note that a post along with its direct and indirect replies forms a subtree as a whole.\n\nLet us take an example. Suppose: a user made an opening post with a message hoge; another user replied to it with fuga; yet another user also replied to the opening post with piyo; someone else replied to the second post (i.e. fuga\u201d) with foobar; and the fifth user replied to the same post with jagjag.\nThe tree of this thread would look like:\n\nhoge\n\u251c\u2500fuga\n\u2502\u3000\u251c\u2500foobar\n\u2502\u3000\u2514\u2500jagjag\n\u2514\u2500piyo\n\nFor easier implementation, Nathan is thinking of a simpler format: the depth of each post from the opening post is represented by dots.

Davis is running a company. His company owns a web service which has a lot of users.

For example, staff working at the company often trip over a cable. No damage if the cable is disconnected. It's just lucky. Computers may fall down and get broken if the cable is connected. He is about to introduce a new computer and a new cable. He wants to minimize staff's steps over the new cable.\n\n\nHis office is laid-out in a two-dimensional grid with H \\times W cells. The new cable should weave along edges of the cells. Each end of the cable is at a corner of a cell. The grid is expressed in zero-origin coordinates, where the upper left corner is (0, 0).\n\n\nEach staff starts his/her work from inside a certain cell and walks in the office along the grid in a fixed repeated pattern every day. A walking pattern is described by a string of four characters U, D, L and R. U means moving up, D means moving down, R means moving to the right, and L means moving to the left.

In this system, each citizen votes for a political party, and the number of seats a party wins will be proportional to the number of votes it receives.

To the $y$-th candidate of a party which received $x$ votes, assign the value $\\dfrac{x}{y}$. Then all the candidates are sorted in the decreasing order of their assigned values. The first $T$ candidates are considered to win, where $T$ is the total number of seats, and the number of seats a party win is the number of its winning candidates. \n\n\nThe table below shows an example with three parties.

The only system adopted in this country is the party-list proportional representation. In this system, each citizen votes for a political party, and the number of seats a party wins will be proportional to the number of votes it receives. Since the total number of seats in the parliament is an integer, of course, it is often impossible to allocate seats exactly proportionaly. In JAG Kingdom, the following method, known as the D'Hondt method, is used to determine the number of seats for each party. \n\n\nAssume that every party has an unlimited supply of candidates and the candidates of each party are ordered in some way. To the $y$-th candidate of a party which received $x$ votes, assign the value $\\dfrac{x}{y}$. Then all the candidates are sorted in the decreasing order of their assigned values. The first $T$ candidates are considered to win, where $T$ is the total number of seats, and the number of seats a party win is the number of its winning candidates. \n\n\nThe table below shows an example with three parties. The first party received $40$ votes, the second $60$ votes, and the third $30$ votes. If the total number of seats is $T = 9$, the first party will win $3$ seats, the second $4$ seats, and the third $2$ seats. \n\n\n\nWhen selecting winning candidates, ties are broken by lottery; any tied candidates will have a chance to win. For instance, in the example above, if $T = 5$ then two candidates tie for the value $20$ and there are two possible outcomes: \n\n\n The first party wins $2$ seats, the second $2$ seats, and the third $1$ seat. \n The first party wins $1$ seat, the second $3$ seats, and the third $1$ seat. \n\nYou have just heard the results of the election on TV.
