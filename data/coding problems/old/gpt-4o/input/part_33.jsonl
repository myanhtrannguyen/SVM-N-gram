Among these $N$ students, $A$ first grade students, $B$ second grade students, and $C$ third grade students are members of the Programming Society. Note that there may be some students who are not the members of the Programming Society, so $A+B +C$ can be less than $N$.\n\n\nThere are good relationships between members of the same grade in the Society. Thus, there is a chat group in the SNS for each grade, and the Society members of the same grade can communicate with each other instantly via their group chat. On the other hand, the relationships between any different grades are not so good, and there are no chat group for the entire Society and the entire high school.\n\n\nIn order to broadcast a message to all the Society members on the SNS, the administrator of the Society came up with a method: the administrator tells the message to one of the $N$ students and have them spread the message on the SNS via the chat groups and their friends. (The administrator itself does not have an account for the SNS.) As the members of the same grade can broadcast the message by the chat group for the grade, we can assume that if one of a grade gets the message, all other members of that grade also get the message instantly. Therefore, if the message is told to at least one member of each grade, we can assume that the message is broadcasted to the all members of the Society on the SNS.\n\n\nBecause it is bothering to communicate between friends, we want to minimize the number of communications between friends.

The next line contains an integer $M$ ($2 \\leq M \\leq 20$), where $M$ is the number of points composing the east riverside. Each of the following $M$ lines contains two integers $ex_i$ and $ey_i$ ($0 \\leq ex_i, ey_i \\leq 1,000$): the coordinate of the $i$-th point of the east riverside is ($ex_i, ey_i$). The east riverside is a polygonal line obtained by connecting the segments between ($ex_i, ey_i$) and ($ex_{i+1}, ey_{i+1}$) for all $1 \\leq i \\leq M - 1$.\n\n\nYou can assume that test cases are under the following conditions.\n\n\n $wy_1$ and $ey_1$ must be 0, and $wy_N$ and $ey_M$ must be 1,000.\n Each polygonal line has no self-intersection.\n Two polygonal lines representing the west and the east riverside have no cross point.\n A point $s$ must be on the west part of the city.

Note that each road doesn't have to be a straight line, but the intersection length with the river must be zero.\n\n\nIn order to cut building costs, the mayor intends to build a highway satisfying the following conditions:\n\n\n Since bridge will cost more than roads, at first the length of a bridge connecting the east part and the west part must be as short as possible.\n Under the above condition, the sum of the length of two roads is minimum.\n\n\nYour task is to write a program computing the total length of a highway satisfying the above conditions.\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of a single test case. The test case is formatted as follows.\n\n$sx$ $sy$ $tx$ $ty$\n$N$\n$wx_1$ $wy_1$\n...\n$wx_N$ $wy_N$\n$M$\n$ex_1$ $ey_1$\n...\n$ex_M$ $ey_M$\n\n\nAt first, we refer to a point on the city by a coordinate ($x, y$): the distance from the west side is $x$ and the distance from the north side is $y$.\n\n\nThe first line contains four integers $sx$, $sy$, $tx$, and $ty$ ($0 \\leq sx, sy, tx, ty \\leq 1,000$): points $s$ and $t$ are located at ($sx, sy$) and ($tx, ty$) respectively. The next line contains an integer $N$ ($2 \\leq N \\leq 20$), where $N$ is the number of points composing the west riverside. Each of the following $N$ lines contains two integers $wx_i$ and $wy_i$ ($0 \\leq wx_i, wy_i \\leq 1,000$): the coordinate of the $i$-th point of the west riverside is ($wx_i, wy_i$). The west riverside is a polygonal line obtained by connecting the segments between ($wx_i, wy_i$) and ($wx_{i+1}, wy_{i+1}$) for all $1 \\leq i \\leq N -1$. The next line contains an integer $M$ ($2 \\leq M \\leq 20$), where $M$ is the number of points composing the east riverside. Each of the following $M$ lines contains two integers $ex_i$ and $ey_i$ ($0 \\leq ex_i, ey_i \\leq 1,000$): the coordinate of the $i$-th point of the east riverside is ($ex_i, ey_i$). The east riverside is a polygonal line obtained by connecting the segments between ($ex_i, ey_i$) and ($ex_{i+1}, ey_{i+1}$) for all $1 \\leq i \\leq M - 1$.\n\n\nYou can assume that test cases are under the following conditions.\n\n\n $wy_1$ and $ey_1$ must be 0, and $wy_N$ and $ey_M$ must be 1,000.\n Each polygonal line has no self-intersection.\n Two polygonal lines representing the west and the east riverside have no cross point.\n A point $s$ must be on the west part of the city. More precisely, $s$ must be on the region surrounded by the square side of the city and the polygonal line of the west riverside and not containing the east riverside points.\n A point $t$ must be on the east part of the city. More precisely, $t$ must be on the region surrounded by the square side of the city and the polygonal line of the east riverside and not containing the west riverside points.\n Each polygonal line intersects with the square only at the two end points. In other words, $0 < wx_i, wy_i < 1,000$ holds for $2 \\leq i \\leq N - 1$ and $0 < ex_i, ey_i < 1,000$ holds for $2 \\leq i \\leq M - 1$.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput single-space separated two numbers in a line: the length of a bridge and the total length of a highway (i.e. a bridge and two roads) satisfying the above mayor's demand.

The purpose of ACM does not matter to you. The only important thing is that workstyles of ACM members are polarized: each member is either a workhorse or an idle fellow.\n\n\nEach member of ACM has a motivation level. The members are ranked by their motivation levels: a member who has a higher motivation level is ranked higher. When several members have the same value of motivation levels, the member who joined ACM later have a higher rank. The top 20% highest ranked members work hard, and the other (80%) members never (!) work. Note that if 20% of the number of ACM members is not an integer, its fraction part is rounded down.\n\n\nYou, a manager of ACM, tried to know whether each member is a workhorse or an idle fellow to manage ACM. Finally, you completed to evaluate motivation levels of all the current members. However, your task is not accomplished yet because the members of ACM are dynamically changed from day to day due to incoming and outgoing of members. So, you want to record transitions of members from workhorses to idle fellows, and vice versa.\n\n\nYou are given a list of the current members of ACM and their motivation levels in chronological order of their incoming date to ACM. You are also given a list of incoming/outgoing of members in chronological order.\n\n\nYour task is to write a program that computes changes of workstyles of ACM members.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 50,000$) that means the number of initial members of ACM. The ($i$ + 1)-th line of the input contains a string $s_i$ and an integer $a_i$ ($0 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^5$), separated by a single space. $s_i$ means the name of the $i$-th initial member and $a_i$ means the motivation level of the $i$-th initial member. Each character of $s_i$ is an English letter, and $1 \\leq |s_i| \\leq 20$. Note that those $N$ lines are ordered in chronological order of incoming dates to ACM of each member.\n\n\nThe ($N$ + 2)-th line of the input contains a single integer $M$ ($1 \\leq M \\leq 20,000$) that means the number of changes of ACM members. The ($N$ + 2 + $j$)-th line of the input contains information of the $j$-th incoming/outgoing member. When the $j$-th information represents an incoming of a member, the information is formatted as \"$+ t_j b_j$\", where $t_j$ is the name of the incoming member and $b_j$ ($0 \\leq b_j \\leq 10^5$) is his motivation level. On the other hand, when the $j$-th information represents an outgoing of a member, the information is formatted as \"$- t_j$\", where $t_j$ means the name of the outgoing member. Each character of $t_j$ is an English letter, and $1 \\leq |t_j| \\leq 20$. Note that uppercase letters and lowercase letters are distinguished. Note that those $M$ lines are ordered in chronological order of dates when each event happens.\n\n\nNo two incoming/outgoing events never happen at the same time. No two members have the same name, but members who left ACM once may join ACM again.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the log, a sequence of changes in chronological order.

For example, \"()()\" and \"(()())\" are balanced strings. \")(\" and \")()(()\" are not balanced strings.\n\n\nDave has a string consisting only of '(' and ')'. It satis\fes the followings:\n\n\n You can make it balanced by swapping adjacent characters exactly $A$ times. \n For any non-negative integer $B$ ($B < A$), you cannot make it balanced by $B$ swaps of adjacent characters.\n It is the shortest of all strings satisfying the above conditions.\n\n\nYour task is to compute Dave's string. If there are multiple candidates, output the minimum in lexicographic order. As is the case with ASCII, '(' is less than ')'.\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of a single test case, which contains an integer $A$ ($1 \\leq A \\leq 10^9$).\n\nOutput\n\nOutput Dave's string in one line.

We refer to the block at the $i$-th from west and the $j$-th from north as $(i, j)$. The westernmost and northernmost block is $(1, 1)$, and the easternmost and southernmost block is $(W,H)$. To make the area good scenery, the block $(i, j)$ has exactly one house if and only if both of $i$ and $j$ are odd numbers.\n\n\nYour task is to construct a water pipe network in the area such that every house in the area is supplied water through the network. A water pipe network consists of pipelines. A pipeline is made by connecting one or more pipes, and a pipeline with l pipes is constructed as follows:\n\n\n choose a first house, and connect the house to an underground water source with a special pipe.\n choose an $i$-th house ($2 \\leq i \\leq l$), and connect the $i$-th house to the ($i - 1$)-th house with a common pipe.

An $i$-th house must be located at either $(x - 2, y + 2)$, $(x, y + 2)$, or $(x + 2, y + 2)$. A common pipe connecting two houses must be located at $(x - 1, y + 1)$, $(x, y + 1)$, or $(x + 1, y + 1)$, respectively.\n\n\nIn addition, you should notice the followings when you construct several pipelines:\n\n\n For each house, exactly one pipeline is through the house.\n Multiple pipes can be located at one block.\n\n\nIn your task, common pipes are common, so you can use any number of common pipes.

Some of the blocks which do not contain a house seem to be home of fierce dogs. Each dog always stays at his/her home block.

Note that when you locate multiple pipes at the same block, each pipe-locating costs 1 unit time for no-dog blocks and 2 for dog-living blocks, respectively. By the way, special pipes are very special, so locating a special pipe costs 0 unit time.\n\n\nYou, a proud pipe fitter, want to accomplish this task as soon as possible. Fortunately, you get a list of blocks which are home of dogs. You have frequently participated in programming contests before being a pipe fitter.

The second line has an integer $N$ ($0 \\leq N \\leq 100,000$), which is the number of dogs in the area.

The area in which you will take charge of piping work is a rectangular shape with $W$ blocks from west to east and $H$ blocks from north to south. We refer to the block at the $i$-th from west and the $j$-th from north as $(i, j)$. The westernmost and northernmost block is $(1, 1)$, and the easternmost and southernmost block is $(W,H)$. To make the area good scenery, the block $(i, j)$ has exactly one house if and only if both of $i$ and $j$ are odd numbers.\n\n\nYour task is to construct a water pipe network in the area such that every house in the area is supplied water through the network. A water pipe network consists of pipelines. A pipeline is made by connecting one or more pipes, and a pipeline with l pipes is constructed as follows:\n\n\n choose a first house, and connect the house to an underground water source with a special pipe.\n choose an $i$-th house ($2 \\leq i \\leq l$), and connect the $i$-th house to the ($i - 1$)-th house with a common pipe. In this case, there is a condition to choose a next $i$-th house because the area is slope land. Let $(x, y)$ be the block of the ($i - 1$)-th house. An $i$-th house must be located at either $(x - 2, y + 2)$, $(x, y + 2)$, or $(x + 2, y + 2)$. A common pipe connecting two houses must be located at $(x - 1, y + 1)$, $(x, y + 1)$, or $(x + 1, y + 1)$, respectively.\n\n\nIn addition, you should notice the followings when you construct several pipelines:\n\n\n For each house, exactly one pipeline is through the house.\n Multiple pipes can be located at one block.\n\n\nIn your task, common pipes are common, so you can use any number of common pipes. On the other hand, special pipes are special, so the number of available special pipes in this task is restricted under ICPC regulation.\n\n\nBesides the restriction of available special pipes, there is another factor obstructing your pipe work: fierce dogs. Some of the blocks which do not contain a house seem to be home of fierce dogs. Each dog always stays at his/her home block. Since several dogs must not live at the same block as their home, you can assume each block is home of only one dog, or not home of any dogs.\n\n\nThe figure below is an example of a water pipe network in a 5 $\\times$ 5 area with 4 special pipes. This corresponds to the first sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocating a common pipe at a no-dog block costs 1 unit time, but locating a common pipe at a dog-living block costs 2 unit time because you have to fight against the fierce dog. Note that when you locate multiple pipes at the same block, each pipe-locating costs 1 unit time for no-dog blocks and 2 for dog-living blocks, respectively. By the way, special pipes are very special, so locating a special pipe costs 0 unit time.\n\n\nYou, a proud pipe fitter, want to accomplish this task as soon as possible. Fortunately, you get a list of blocks which are home of dogs. You have frequently participated in programming contests before being a pipe fitter.

To determine the revision $R_{ENBUG}$ ($R_{PASS} < R_{ENBUG} \\leq R_{RC}$) in which our software started to fail, we must test our product revision-by-revision.\n\n\nHere, we can assume the following conditions:\n\n\n When we test at the revision $R$, the test passes if $R < R_{ENBUG}$, or fails otherwise.\n It is equally possible, which revision between $R_{PASS} + 1$ and $R_{RC}$ is $R_{ENBUG}$.\n\n\nFrom the first assumption, we don't need to test all the revisions. All we have to do is to find the revision $R$ such that the test at $R - 1$ passes and the test at $R$ fails. We have $K$ testing devices. Using them, we can test at most $K$ different revisions simultaneously. We call this \"parallel testing\". By the restriction of the testing environment, we cannot start new tests until a current parallel testing finishes, even if we don't use all the $K$ devices.\n\n\nParallel testings take some cost. The more tests fail, the more costly the parallel testing becomes. If $i$ tests fail in a parallel testing, its cost is $T_i$ ($0 \\leq i \\leq K$). And if we run parallel testings multiple times, the total cost is the sum of their costs.\n\n\nOf course we want to minimize the total cost to determine $R_{ENBUG}$, by choosing carefully how many and which revisions to test on each parallel testing. What is the minimum expected value of the total cost if we take an optimal strategy?\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of a single test case with the following format.\n\n$R_{PASS}$ $R_{RC}$ $K$\n$T_0$ $T_1$ ... $T_K$\n\n\n$R_{PASS}$ and $R_{RC}$ are integers that represent the revision numbers of our software at which the test passed and failed, respectively. $1 \\leq R_{PASS} < R_{RC} \\leq 1,000$ holds. $K$ ($1 \\leq K \\leq 30$) is the maximum number of revisions we can test in a single parallel testing. $T_i$ is an integer that represents the cost of a parallel testing in which $i$ tests fail ($0 \\leq i \\leq K$). You can assume $1 \\leq T_0 \\leq T_1 \\leq ... \\leq T_K \\leq 100,000$.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput the minimum expected value of the total cost.

There are $N$ players including you.\n\n\n  This game consists of multiple rounds. While the rounds go, the number of remaining players decreases. In each round, each remaining player will select an arbitrary shape independently. People who show rocks win if all of the other people show scissors. In this same manner, papers win rocks, scissors win papers. There is no draw situation due to the special rule of this game: if a round is tied based on the normal rock-paper-scissors game rule, the player who has the highest programming contest rating (this is nothing to do with the round!) will be the only winner of the round. Thus, some players win and the other players lose on each round. The losers drop out of the game and the winners proceed to a new round. They repeat it until only one player becomes the winner.\n\n\nEach player is numbered from $1$ to $N$. Your number is $1$.
