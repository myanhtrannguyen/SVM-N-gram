(Here the least significant bit is considered the 1-st least significant bit.)\n\n\n\nAfter Snuke finishes doing operations, Takahashi tries to sort a in ascending order by doing the operation below some number of times.

In the cinema there are N rows with N seats each, forming an N\\times N square. We denote with 1, 2,\\dots, N the viewers in the first row (from left to right); with N+1, \\dots, 2N the viewers in the second row (from left to right); and so on until the last row, whose viewers are denoted by N^2-N+1,\\dots, N^2.\nAt the end of the movie, the viewers go out of the cinema in a certain order: the i-th viewer leaving her seat is the one denoted by the number P_i. The viewer P_{i+1} waits until viewer P_i has left the cinema before leaving her seat.\nTo exit from the cinema, a viewer must move from seat to seat until she exits the square of seats (any side of the square is a valid exit). A viewer can move from a seat to one of its 4 adjacent seats (same row or same column).\nWhile leaving the cinema, it might be that a certain viewer x goes through a seat currently occupied by viewer y; in that case viewer y will hate viewer x forever. Each viewer chooses the way that minimizes the number of viewers that will hate her forever.\nCompute the number of pairs of viewers (x, y) such that y will hate x forever.\n\n\n\n\nConstraints\n2 \\le N \\le 500\nThe sequence P_1, P_2, \\dots, P_{N^2} is a permutation of \\{1, 2, \\dots, N^2\\}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInputThe input is given from Standard Input in the format\nN\nP_1 P_2 \\cdots P_{N^2}\n\n\n\n\n\nOutputIf ans is the number of pairs of viewers described in the statement, you should print on Standard Output\nans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Input 13\n1 3 7 9 5 4 8 6 2\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Output 11\n\nBefore the end of the movie, the viewers are arranged in the cinema as follows:\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\n\nThe first four viewers leaving the cinema (1, 3, 7, 9) can leave the cinema without going through any seat, so they will not be hated by anybody.\nThen, viewer 5 must go through one of the seats where viewers 2, 4, 6, 8 are currently seated while leaving the cinema; hence he will be hated by at least one of those viewers.\nFinally the remaining viewers can leave the cinema (in the order 4, 8, 6, 2) without going through any occupied seat (actually, they can leave the cinema without going through any seat at all).\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Input 24\n6 7 1 4 13 16 10 9 5 11 12 14 15 2 3 8\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Output 23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Input 36\n11 21 35 22 7 36 27 34 8 20 15 13 16 1 24 3 2 17 26 9 18 32 31 23 19 14 4 25 10 29 28 33 12 6 5 30\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Output 311"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}
