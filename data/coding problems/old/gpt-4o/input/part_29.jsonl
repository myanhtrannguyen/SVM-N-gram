So he cannot place the tubes over the faucets, nor under the exit of another tubes. Moreover, the tubes cannot be crossed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, Arthur did not want to give up. Although one-to-many division at an arbitrary ratio is impossible, he decided to minimize the number of faucets used. He asked you for a help to write a program to calculate the minimum number of faucets required to pour water into the vessel, for the number of columns and the ratio at which each column is going to be filled.\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of an integer sequence.\n\n\nThe first integer indicates N, the number of columns in the vessel. Then the following N integers describe the capacity by which each column should be filled. The i-th integer in this part specifies the ratio at which he is going to pour water into the i-th column.\n\n\nYou may assume that N \u2264 100, and for all i, vi \u2264 1000000.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput the number of the minimum faucet required to complete the operation.\n\nSample Input and Output\nInput #1\n\n2 1 1\n\nOutput #1\n\n1\n\n\nInput #2\n\n2 3 1\n\nOutput #2\n\n2\n\n\nInput #3\n\n2 2 1\n\nOutput #3\n\n2\n\n\nInput #4\n\n4 3 1 1 3\n\nOutput #4\n\n3\n\n\nInput #5\n\n3 1 2 1\n\nOutput #5\n\n3\n\n\nInput #6\n\n5 1 2 3 4 5\n\nOutput #6\n\n5\n\n\nInput #7\n\n7 8 8 1 1 2 4 8\n\nOutput #7\n\n1"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

On the wall of this room, there are statues and a locked\ndoor. The door lock is opening if the beams are hitting every statue.\nIn this room, there are pillars, mirrors and crystals. A mirror reflects\na laser beam. The angle of a mirror should be vertical, horizontal or diagonal.\nA crystal split a laser beam into two laser beams with \u03b8\u00b1(\u03c0/4)\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle of the incident laser beam. He can push one mirror or\ncrystal at a time. He can push mirrors/crystals multiple times. But he can push\nup to two of mirrors/crystals because the door will be locked forever when he\npushes the third mirrors/crystals.\nTo simplify the situation, the room consists of W times H\nunit square as shown in figure 1.\n\nFigure 1\nHe can move from a square to the neighboring square vertically or\nhorizontally. Please note that he cannot move diagonal direction. Pillars,\nmirrors and crystals exist on the center of a square. As shown in the figure 2,\nyou can assume that a mirror/crystal moves to the center of the next square at\nthe next moment when he push it. That means, you don't need to consider a state\nabout pushing a mirror/crystal.\n\nFigure 2\nYou can assume the following conditions:\n\nthe direction of laser beams are horizontal, vertical or diagonal,\nthe embrasure is shooting a laser beam to the center of the\n\tneighboring square,\nthe embrasure is on the wall,\nhe cannot enter to a square with pillar,\na mirror reflects a laser beam at the center of the square,\na mirror reflects a laser beam on the both side,\na mirror blocks a laser beam if the mirror is parallel to\n\tthe laser beam,\na crystal split a laser beam at the center of the square,\ndiagonal laser does not hit a statue,\nand he cannot leave the room if the door is hit by a vertical, horizontal or\n\tdiagonal laser.\n\nIn order to leave this deadly room, he should push and move mirrors and\ncrystals to the right position and leave the room from the door.

A glyph may be flipped.\n <box> is a rectangle surrounding a <seq>.

in one line.\n\nSample Input\n\n2 1\na 11 9\n****.....\n.*.*.....\n.*.*.....\n.*..*....\n.**..*...\n..**..*..\n..*.*....\n..**.*.*.\n..*..*.*.\n..*****.*\n******.**\nb 10 6\n....*.\n....*.\n....*.\n....*.\n....*.\n....*.\n....*.\n....*.\n.**..*\n*****.\n19 55\n*******************************************************\n*.....................................................*\n*.********************.********************...........*\n*.*..................*.*..................*...........*\n*.*.****.............*.*.............****.*.****......*\n*.*..*.*..........*..*.*..*..........*.*..*..*.*......*\n*.*..*.*..........*..*.*..*..........*.*..*..*.*......*\n*.*..*..*.........*..*.*..*.........*..*..*..*..*.....*\n*.*..**..*........*..*.*..*........*..**..*..**..*....*\n*.*...**..*.......*..*.*..*.......*..**...*...**..*...*\n*.*...*.*.........*..*.*..*.........*.*...*...*.*.....*\n*.*...**.*.*......*..*.*..*......*.*.**...*...**.*.*..*\n*.*...*..*.*......*..*.*..*......*.*..*...*...*..*.*..*\n*.*...*****.*..**..*.*.*.*..**..*.*****...*...*****.*.*\n*.*.******.**.*****..*.*..*****.**.******.*.******.**.*\n*.*..................*.*..................*...........*\n*.********************.********************...........*\n*.....................................................*\n*******************************************************\n2 3\na 2 3\n.*.\n***\nb 3 3\n.*.\n***\n.*.\n2 3\n.*.\n***\n4 3\n***\n*.*\n*.*\n***\n9 13\n************.\n*..........*.\n*.......*..*.\n*...*..***.*.\n*..***.....*.\n*...*......*.\n*..........*.\n************.\n.............\n3 1\na 2 2\n.*\n**\nb 2 1\n*\n*\nc 3 3\n***\n*.*\n***\n11 16\n****************\n*..............*\n*....*********.*\n*....*.......*.*\n*.*..*.***...*.*\n*.**.*.*.*.*.*.*\n*....*.***.*.*.*\n*....*.......*.*\n*....*********.*\n*..............*\n****************\n0 0\n\nOutput for the Sample Input\n\n[[ab][ab]a]\n#\na\n[]\n[ba]\n#\n[[cb]a]\n#"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}
