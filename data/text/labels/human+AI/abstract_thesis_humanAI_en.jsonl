Existing fiber-based QKD systems are limited to transmission distances of less than 1000 km. Satellite QKD presents a viable alternative for longer distances but introduces challenges related to environmental noise and the rapid relative movement of the transmitter and receiver. Consequently, these systems utilize a classical channel, essentially a timing and synchronization system, in conjunction with the quantum channel. Peide Zhang.et.al suggested transmitting a positioning sequence (a de Bruijn sequence) within these systems. Considering timing jitter performance, prolonged periods without pulses should be avoided. In Zhang's approach, each bit is represented by two pulse slots (on-on for 1 and on-off for 0) to prevent consecutive no-pulses. However, this Hybrid de Bruijn code requires 2npulse slots for a de Bruijn sequence of length nand necessitates receiving a subsequence of 2 lognpulse slots for position identification. This thesis introduces run length limited de Bruijn sequences, where each binary bit is represented by a single pulse slot (1is on and 0is off), offering a more efficient approach to synchronization and avoidance of extended no-pulse intervals. The RdB sequences demonstrate improved generality and efficiency compared to previous methods. This work provides the first explicit formula for determining the maximal length of run length limited de Bruijn sequences. Furthermore, it presents an efficient construction method for maximal-length run length limited de Bruijn sequences using Lyndon words.

However, managing identities and authentication poses a notable challenge within the blockchain environment, despite its numerous advantages. To address this issue, it is essential to develop software that connects traditional web authentication methods with blockchain systems. This intermediary software would create a more user-friendly and accessible blockchain environment, allowing users to effortlessly access blockchain services and applications with reliable identity verification. Blockchain is recognized for its robust security features, and any software integration must sustain this security level while aligning with conventional web authentication protocols. Neglecting to adequately address security issues could jeopardize the credibility of blockchain technology. Techniques like Shamirâ€™s Secret Sharing (SSS) and Distributed Key Generation (DKG) offer promising solutions to these challenges. SSS is a cryptographic method that splits a secret into several parts, distributing them among participants, thus ensuring that no single individual has full access to the secret, which enhances security and minimizes the risk of unauthorized access. DKG allows for the collective generation of cryptographic keys without depending on a single trusted party, thereby adding an additional layer of security and decentralization to the authentication process. My goal is to create a social authentication solution for decentralized applications (DApps) using SSS and DKG techniques. This solution would enable users to authenticate via their social media accounts while ensuring their privacy and security through the implementation of secure and distributed authentication protocols.

Nonetheless, these translation models necessitate extensive training data and often face difficulties when dealing with texts from specific domains. A domain may be defined as texts related to a particular topic or texts intended for a specific purpose. Although NMT systems can be fine-tuned for enhanced translation accuracy within a target domain if provided with a representative training corpus, this adaptation approach can lead to drawbacks, such as susceptibility to errors from out-of-domain inputs and \"catastrophic forgetting\" of previously learned domains in the training data. Furthermore, single translation systems are required to manage numerous potential domains in practical scenarios, rendering the \"one domain one model\" strategy impractical. An effective solution lies in the development of multi-domain NMT systems that are trained across various domains and adapted for multiple target domains. This strategy is justified by two main reasons: first, a larger training corpus aids in the generalization of the NMT system; second, text from one domain can significantly assist in tuning an NMT model to a closely related domain. The limited availability of data and the potential benefits of positive transfer further support the rationale for creating multilingual NMT systems. Operating multiple bilingual machine translation systems demands substantial hardware resources as the number of language pairings increases quadratically with the addition of languages. Hence, both multi-domain and multilingual NMT systems are crucial for optimizing resources within the machine translation industry and enhancing translation quality. My research is inspired by the concept of incorporating a domain tag for individual sentences, a method that has proven to be highly effective in training for multilingual and multi-domain machine translation. The proposed method prioritizes data quality while maintaining the integrity of the model's architecture. This thesis aims to develop a multi-domain machine translation system specifically focused on three domains: legal, medical, and technology. The multi-domain machine translation system consists of two main components: domain classification and neural machine translation. Before entering the NMT stage, sentences are processed through a domain classification module that determines the domain of each sentence.

Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses this by leveraging readily available unlabeled data to adapt models to new data distributions. Existing domain adaptation methods often focus solely on aligning intra-class representational distributions across domains, neglecting the inter-class structural relationships. This can lead to reduced discriminability of aligned representations in the target domain compared to the source domain. To address this limitation, this study introduces Multi-level Contrastive Learning for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (MCLDA), a novel one-stage adaptation framework. MCLDA emphasizes the semantic concepts of individual pixels to promote class-discriminative learning, thereby improving the performance of self-training methods. The method begins by formulating a pixel-wise contrastive loss that considers relationships between pixel-wise representations from both domains, effectively grouping pixel representations of the same category while separating those from different categories. Contrastive loss is applied at both the feature and output levels. Furthermore, a novel mixing strategy is proposed to mitigate dataset imbalance by repeatedly copying pixels from under-represented classes in source images and pasting them into target images. Experimental results on the GTA5 â†’Cityscapes benchmark show that the proposed method achieves 56.76 in terms of mIoU.

By fostering a network of partners to collaboratively develop interfaces, applications, and robust commerce stores, Shopify has solidified its position. E-commerce websites, such as those built on Shopify, offer a range of advanced features, including multi-layer catalogs, shopping carts, favorite pages, price comparisons, cross-selling, ordering, payment processing, marketing campaigns, customer management, and collection management, as seen in Figure A (References: [citation]). However, through practical experience with e-commerce products, it has become apparent that certain essential features are lacking, highlighting the need for customization to cater to the specific needs of businesses and store owners. This realization has motivated the selection of the research topic, \"Designing a search page application on Shopify e-commerce platform\", as outlined in Figure B (References: [citation]), with the aim of developing a tailored solution that can be integrated into commerce systems to support store owners in utilizing products effectively.", "label": "human + AI", "label_detailed": "human + Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo"}
{"solution_id": "gemini20-0026", "problem_id": "00260001", "content": "In contemporary society, multilingualism is increasingly important, as foreign language acquisition enhances job prospects and facilitates intercultural communication and understanding. Consequently, children are often encouraged to learn a foreign language early in life. English, a prominent foreign language in our nation, is being introduced to children at younger ages due to its integration into many countriesâ€™ educational curricula. While traditional English language learning methods remain valuable, they are limited by geographical location, time constraints, and potential cost. Technological advancements have significantly influenced English language learning; the proliferation of smartphones, computers, and communication technologies enables learners to access English learning resources with greater flexibility. Numerous English learning applications have emerged across various platforms, each possessing unique strengths and weaknesses, although only a few offer a holistic language learning experience. This thesis details the design and development of a web application intended for teaching and learning English, incorporating features such as a dictionary, flashcards, lessons, and exercises. Furthermore, the system includes administrative functionalities for managing users and content.", "label": "human + AI", "label_detailed": "human + Gemini 2.0"}
{"solution_id": "gpt-4o-mini-0027", "problem_id": "00270001", "content": "During the Fourth Industrial Revolution, significant advancements in technology have greatly benefited humans across various domains, particularly in consumer shopping. However, due to geographical constraints and time factors, individuals are now dedicating more time to shopping, leading to the rise of online commerce. This trend became especially prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic, where online shopping served as a vital solution, enabling consumers to maintain their livelihoods and assisting producers and distributors in enhancing their operations. Presently, Vietnam has nearly 45 million individuals engaged in online shopping, which offers convenience and time savings, allowing consumers to select essential items for daily life without excessive travel as long as they have internet access. Nevertheless, online shopping is fraught with challenges, including the delivery of substandard or counterfeit products by sellers. Some vendors only display images and prices, leaving buyers waiting indefinitely for deliveries, even after completing transactions. Additionally, there are risks associated with the exposure of personal information during online shopping. Customers can mitigate these risks by choosing reputable e-commerce platforms and urging the government to take measures to ensure the reliability of products sold online. I propose developing an e-commerce platform designed to facilitate the purchase of authentic goods with reasonable shipping costs and prompt delivery. This initiative will require the establishment of a subsystem for suppliers to manage their products and distribution effectively. This research project focuses on creating such a module for suppliers within my e-commerce system, which I have named Soda e-commerce. This subsystem is designed with a user-friendly interface to enhance the experience for suppliers, enabling them to effectively showcase their products on Soda e-commerce.", "label": "human + AI", "label_detailed": "human + GPT-4o-mini"}
