Domain adaptation for semantic segmentation has emerged as a promising solution to bridge this gap, but existing methods often struggle to align features effectively across domains. This thesis addresses this challenge by proposing **MCLDA: Multi-level Contrastive Learning for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation**, a novel framework designed to enhance domain adaptation performance through multi-level feature alignment and contrastive learning.  \n\nThe primary objective of this research is to develop a robust domain adaptation framework that leverages contrastive learning at multiple feature levelsâ€”pixel, region, and globalâ€”to improve the alignment of source and target domain representations.

This thesis addresses the challenge of domain adaptive semantic segmentation by proposing a novel approach called Multi-level Contrastive Learning for Domain Adaptation (MCLDA). The motivation stems from the observation that existing methods often struggle to align feature distributions across domains effectively, particularly at different semantic levels.\n\nThe primary objective of this work is to develop a domain adaptive semantic segmentation model that achieves robust performance on target domains without requiring labeled target data. Specifically, MCLDA aims to learn domain-invariant features by minimizing the discrepancy between source and target domain representations at multiple levels. This is achieved through a novel contrastive learning framework.\n\nMCLDA employs a deep convolutional neural network architecture, incorporating ResNet as the backbone for feature extraction. The contrastive learning framework leverages both pixel-level and feature-level constraints to align representations. Pixel-level contrastive learning encourages similar pixels to cluster together while pushing dissimilar pixels apart, thereby enhancing feature discrimination within each domain. Feature-level contrastive learning then aligns the global feature distributions across domains, promoting domain invariance. The model is trained using adversarial learning to further reduce domain discrepancy.\n\nThe results demonstrate that MCLDA significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation methods on several benchmark datasets. The achieved outcomes highlight the effectiveness of multi-level contrastive learning in capturing domain-invariant semantic information. The key contribution lies in the innovative integration of pixel-level and feature-level contrastive learning, which enables robust adaptation to unseen target domains.\n\nIn conclusion, this thesis presents MCLDA, a novel and effective approach for domain adaptive semantic segmentation.
