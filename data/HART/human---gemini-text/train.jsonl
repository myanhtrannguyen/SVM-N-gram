{"text": "Deep learning holds immense promise for revolutionizing medicine, yet its integration into clinical practice faces a significant hurdle: trustworthiness.  Doctors and patients need to trust the AI's diagnostic capabilities, requiring not just high accuracy but also clear explanations and reliable decision-making processes.  This study addresses this challenge by focusing on building inherently interpretable models for medical AI, specifically targeting Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis.\n\nExplainability and reliability are paramount for trustworthy medical AI.  Explainability ensures that the rationale behind an AI's diagnosis is transparent, increasing acceptance among patients and clinicians. Reliability, on the other hand, guarantees that predictions are based on relevant patterns rather than spurious correlations or biases, often referred to as \"Clever Hans\" behavior.  While post-hoc explainability tools exist for complex black-box models, they can be unreliable.  Therefore, this paper prioritizes building interpretable models, providing insights into their decision-making process during the training phase itself.\n\nExisting AD diagnostic models often rely on deep neural networks (DNNs), which, despite their performance, lack interpretability, hindering their clinical adoption.  Further complicating matters, AD diagnosis frequently involves multiple modalities like CT and MRI scans.  While combining these modalities can improve accuracy, it poses a further challenge for interpretable model design.  This work tackles these challenges by introducing a novel approach that guides the training process to penalize reliance on irrelevant cues, even if the predictions are correct.  This ensures the model learns genuine patterns, promoting reliability and generalizability to unseen data.\n\nSpecifically, we propose an interpretable, multimodal model for classifying AD across its various stages, from early detection (mild cognitive impairment) to more severe forms.  This fine-grained classification surpasses existing approaches that typically offer only binary classifications or combine multiple stages.  Our model leverages a novel Jacobian-Augmented Loss function (JAL) incorporating Jacobian Saliency Maps (JSM) as a model self-debugger.  JSMs, calculated during preprocessing, highlight relevant image regions, enhancing both model precision and interpretability.  This modality-agnostic approach seamlessly integrates multiple data sources, focusing on images, a crucial aspect for early AD detection.\n\nThe JAL function not only guides the model toward accurate predictions but also penalizes reliance on incorrect cues, mimicking a debugging process.  This ensures the model avoids Clever Hans behavior, learning from genuine patterns and increasing the trustworthiness of its predictions.  Furthermore, the use of JSM provides insights into the model's decision-making, making it more transparent and interpretable.\n\nIn summary, this paper contributes:\n\n*   A novel loss function, JAL, incorporating JSM for model self-debugging, improving both accuracy and interpretability.\n*   Multimodal data fusion using two distinct techniques, demonstrating JAL's adaptability to various modalities.\n*   Fine-grained, four-class AD classification, exceeding the accuracy of existing coarse-grained approaches.\n*   Comprehensive evaluation, including an ablation study, validating the efficacy of JSM for reliable predictions and trustworthy interpretations.  This work addresses the critical need for trustworthy AI in medicine, paving the way for greater clinical adoption of AI-driven diagnostic tools."}

{"text": "The article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" describes how a NASA spacecraft orbiting Mars, while scouting landing sites for a future mission, captured an image resembling a human face. This shadowy likeness, seemingly smiling back at the camera, sparked considerable speculation.\n\nWhile some theorized the face could be evidence of alien activity—a landing site, a takeoff point, or even a deliberate construction—the article explains it is most likely a rock formation.  The grainy 1976 image, taken by the Viking 1 orbiter, fueled the imagination of many. Some skeptics even suggested that Martian clouds, through which the spacecraft’s cameras peered, were intentionally obscuring alien structures.  However, the \"face\" is located in Mars' northern latitudes, where it was winter at the time of the photograph.  The apparent haze was more likely atmospheric conditions, perhaps wind-blown snow.\n\nThe idea of aliens deliberately creating such a recognizable feature, knowing it would eventually be discovered, seems far-fetched.  A subsequent, higher-resolution image taken by the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) in 2001 provided a much clearer view of the formation. This more detailed picture revealed the \"face\" to be nothing more than a mesa-like rock formation, dispelling the earlier theories.  While the 1976 image generated considerable excitement and speculation, the 2001 photograph reassured the public that there was no mystery to fear or be surprised by."}

A man lost between reality and technology, stalked by a short, rotund figure and an eerily tall, elegant, thin one.  I had mused over its creativity, how compelling the narrative was.\n\nYet, the story clung to me, a persistent thought lodged in the back of my mind. Watching.  I returned to my normal life, but a part of me remained alert, an awareness I didn't fully grasp until the second or third time I saw *them*. \"Oh hey, look at that fat little man and that tall, skinny man,\" I'd think, \"that reminds me of the Otherlanders.\" I was so naive.  It continued, this unsettling pattern. Everywhere I went, I noticed their embodiment—in men, women, couples, even animals, but never in anyone I knew.  I only recognized the size relation, the stark contrast. I never saw them again after that initial glance, yet they would always return.  Walking hand-in-hand through a brewery, making a delivery in the field where I worked, sitting at the movies, riding bikes down the street, even as birds in windows or squirrels in trees. Always there. Always two. What did they want? This couldn't be coincidence anymore.\n\nWhat *was* the story about? I tried to find it again, but there was no trace, no similar tales online or in libraries. The mystery began to consume me. What had the man haunted by these figures wanted? Needed? Loved? What did he… fear?\n\nI resolved to speak to them. I had never tried before.  Standing in the middle of the field, I waited for the short, rotund figure and the tall, elegant one to invade my space, to observe, to follow. The wind rustled the cheatgrass and sagebrush around me.  I could hear the highway rumbling over the hillside behind me as I scanned the plains.\n\n\"Hello, Elat.\"\n\nThey stood before me. I saw no footprints in the sand to indicate their approach.  Fear gripped me, but I noted the tall, thin, regally boned man in a tight pinstripe suit beside a smaller man with a bowler hat and a portly mustache attempting, and failing, to hide his bulbous face.\n\n\"How… how do you know my name?\"\n\n\"Elat Das, this *is* your name?\"\n\n\"Why are you following me?

{"text": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer a compelling solution for autonomous inspection of structures like wind turbines, eliminating the risks associated with manual climbing or the high costs of disassembling components for inspection.  This work focuses on developing a method for autonomous visual inspection of wind turbine rotor blades *while the turbine is rotating*, offering significant advantages over traditional methods that require halting operation.\n\nTraditionally, wind turbine inspection involved either personnel physically climbing the turbine, a dangerous task, or dismantling the rotor blades, a costly procedure.  Stopping turbine operation for inspection, as required by existing UAV-based inspection methods focusing on stationary turbines, also introduces inconvenience and expense. Inspecting a rotating turbine circumvents these issues.\n\nSeveral studies have explored UAVs, primarily quadrotors, for inspecting *stationary* wind turbines [1]-[4].  For instance, [1] presents a vision-based system using LiDAR and a camera, integrating YOLOv3 and a customized Hough transform.  [2] introduces a machine vision module for UAV navigation during inspection, estimating relative position and blade position using Hough transform and Kalman filter.  [3] focuses on generating a 3D wind turbine map, path planning, and collision avoidance using GPS and 2D LiDAR.  Building upon previous work [4], a semi-autonomous system with a LiDAR-equipped UAV was developed for blade inspection, generating blade images and a 3D turbine model.  Finally, [5] provides a review of non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques for wind turbines, focusing on the inspection methods themselves rather than their implementation.\n\nResearch on inspecting *rotating* wind turbines using UAVs is significantly more limited due to the dynamic environment and the constant need to maintain a safe distance from the moving blades.  However, some promising results have emerged.  [6] proposes a novel method for strain monitoring using optical digital image correlation, validated with strain gauges.  Similarly, [7] employs a drone-mounted digital image correlation system for precise dynamic blade characterization during rotation.\n\nDespite these advancements, challenges remain, including developing robust blade detection and tracking algorithms, ensuring safe UAV operation in the dynamic environment, and effectively managing dynamically acquired blade information.\n\nThis article presents our work on inspecting rotating wind turbines with a UAV. Our system determines the relative position of the rotating turbine using LiDAR, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and GPS.  We also developed a method for visual inspection of the rotating blades by planning a suitable trajectory and triggering a gimbal-mounted camera.  The system was experimentally tested using data collected at a real-world wind farm.\n\nThe article is structured as follows: Section I introduces the topic and provides a literature review. Section II details the 3D model generation and model matching algorithm for processing LiDAR data. Section III describes the trajectory generation algorithm for inspecting rotating blades and the autonomous camera triggering setup. Section IV presents experimental results from a real-world wind farm and discusses the findings. Finally, Section V concludes the study, summarizing the work and suggesting future research directions."}

{"text": "**Henri: A Northeast Tropical Storm**\n\nNEW YORK — Henri, downgraded to a tropical storm on Sunday, churned inland across the Northeast. Here’s a breakdown of this unusual weather event:\n\n**Henri's Status and Impact**\n\nHenri, downgraded from hurricane status early Sunday, made landfall in Rhode Island at midday. By Sunday evening, it weakened further while moving over western Massachusetts and Connecticut.  While wind speeds decreased to 40 mph (64 kph), the primary threat remains heavy rainfall, leading to potential storm surges and inland flooding, historically more dangerous than high winds.\n\nHenri veered west after landfall, impacting Connecticut and New York's Hudson River Valley with heavy rain and potential flooding. While the storm surge wasn't as significant as Superstorm Sandy in 2012, the storm's slow movement concentrates rainfall, increasing flood risks.  The storm is forecast to move east early Monday, affecting Vermont and New Hampshire before exiting into the Gulf of Maine.\n\n**Hurricanes vs. Tropical Storms**\n\nThe distinction lies in sustained wind speeds. Hurricanes have sustained winds of 74 mph or higher, while tropical storms have sustained winds up to 73 mph.\n\n**Historical Context: Henri, Bob, and Gloria**\n\nHenri’s near-hurricane landfall would have been New England's first in 30 years.  Hurricane Bob in August 1991 caused 17 deaths and $1.5 billion in damage.  Connecticut residents may recall Hurricane Gloria in September 1985, which hit Long Island and Connecticut, resulting in eight deaths and nearly $1 billion in damage.\n\n**Storm Naming Conventions**\n\nThe World Meteorological Association assigns human names to Atlantic storms, cycling through a list of 21 names each season.\n\n**Formation and Climate Change**\n\nTwo factors contribute to northward-tracking storms: a tropical system and steering currents. While rare, Henri's path isn't directly attributed to climate change, although global warming is known to intensify hurricanes, making them stronger and wetter.\n\n**Preparedness and Comparisons**\n\nResidents are advised to take standard precautions: secure boats, fuel vehicles, stock supplies, and prepare for potential power outages, which could last a week or more. While Henri is unlikely to replicate Superstorm Sandy’s impact on New York City and the Jersey Shore, the Hudson River Valley faces significant flood risk.  Unlike Sandy, Henri provided less preparation time.\n\n**Comparisons to Other Storms**\n\nHenri is unrelated to 1991's \"Perfect Storm\" (also known as the Halloween Storm), a nor'easter that later developed a hurricane at its center.  This unnamed hurricane would have been called \"Henri\" due to the six-year recycling of Atlantic hurricane names (excluding retired names like Katrina and Bob).  The 2000 film \"The Perfect Storm\" depicts this event, not Hurricane Bob. While Hurricane Irene in 2011 impacted Vermont, it had weakened to a tropical storm by then.\n\n**Current Situation and Governor's Status**\n\nDespite some schools returning, tourists remain on the Atlantic coast.  Outgoing Governor Cuomo, whose term ends Monday at 11:59 p.m. EDT, is currently managing the state's response to Henri."}

{"text": "Network softwarization has revolutionized service deployment and management, offering unprecedented flexibility and reconfigurability.  Replacing hardware-based network functions with virtual network functions (VNFs) eliminates hardware constraints, and cloud computing with software-based networks allows service providers to optimize resource utilization in data centers [1].\n\nHowever, the increasing number of network devices and interconnections [2], coupled with the proliferation of services through virtual networks, has led to greater complexity and scale.  This expansion presents significant management challenges, potentially degrading service quality and consistency [1], [2].\n\nRecognizing the need for reliable service delivery, providers are turning to data-driven approaches for virtual network management.  These approaches leverage big data and machine learning (ML) to effectively manage large-scale networks with intricate dependencies.  Anomaly detection, a crucial network management technique, aims to maintain service quality by rapidly identifying and addressing abnormal system behavior [3], [4], [5].\n\nExisting ML-based anomaly detection methods for VNFs often rely on data collected from the operating system (OS) or hypervisor of virtual machines (VMs) [1], [6], [7]. For instance, [1] collected a dataset and applied techniques like decision tree-based gradient boosting machine (GBM), XGBoost, and deep neural networks (DNNs) to differentiate anomalous instances from normal ones.\n\nHowever, these methods often overlook valuable sequential information inherent in the VNF sequence—a critical factor given that network traffic traverses VNF instances arranged in a specific order [8].  Moreover, if services require different service function chain (SFC) compositions (varying in VNF type, order, and number), existing approaches often necessitate training separate models, particularly when the number of VNF instances differs due to input dimension discrepancies.  Furthermore, they often fail to leverage temporal information within time-series monitoring data, which could be crucial when anomalies exhibit temporal patterns, as illustrated in Figure 1.\n\nTo capture sequential information within the VNF sequence, we employ unidirectional and bidirectional recurrent neural networks (Uni- and Bi-RNNs) and Transformers.  These sequential architectures accommodate variable-length input sequences, making our models compatible with data from SFCs with varying numbers of VNFs.  This compatibility enables joint training across datasets from different SFCs.  Additionally, to capture temporal information, we utilize RNNs, which process monitoring data at a given time step alongside a series of inputs from previous time steps.\n\nTo further enhance the utilization of temporal information, we incorporate an additional component that leverages the prediction from the preceding time step."}

However, traditional ML algorithms are vulnerable to various attacks, particularly evasion attacks, where carefully crafted input perturbations force prediction errors (Biggio et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2015; Papernot et al., 2016a; Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2016).\n\nWhile extensive research exists on evasion attacks against linear classifiers (Lowd & Meek, 2005; Biggio et al., 2011) and, more recently, deep neural networks (Szegedy et al., 2014; Goodfellow et al., 2015), fewer studies address tree-based models. Decision trees offer interpretability (Tolomei et al., 2017), providing human-understandable predictions based on syntactic checks of domain features—a particularly appealing characteristic in security contexts.  Furthermore, decision tree ensembles are among the most effective methods for non-perceptual problems and are widely used in Kaggle competitions (Chollet, 2017).\n\nThis paper presents Feature Partitioned Forest (FPF), an algorithm that constructs robust decision tree ensembles resistant to evasion attacks. The resulting binary classifier is often robust by construction.  Given a test instance targeted by an attacker, if most trees in the ensemble accurately classify that instance, the attacker is unlikely to successfully compromise the entire ensemble. Our method relies on a specific feature sampling technique: we randomly equipartition the feature set and train each tree on a distinct partition.  Furthermore, consistent with adversarial learning, we assume a threat model that limits the attacker's budget, restricting the number of manipulable features and thus bounding the distance between the original and perturbed instances. We also propose an efficient approximate certification method for our tree ensembles, assessing the minimal accuracy on a given dataset without requiring computationally expensive evasion attack simulations."}

While often overlooked, Venus is the closest planet to us in terms of size and density, making it practically Earth's twin.\n\nHowever, despite this proximity, Venus presents significant challenges for exploration.  As noted, its reputation as a difficult planet to study is well-earned.  The incredibly hot temperatures make it the hottest planet in our solar system, and the atmospheric pressure far exceeds that of Earth. These extreme conditions create a hostile environment for human exploration.\n\nDespite these challenges, studying Venus can illuminate much about planetary evolution.  Paragraph 4 highlights this by referring to Venus as our \"sister planet\" and pondering why it became so inhospitable.  Evidence suggests that Venus once possessed vast oceans, much like Earth.  Even now, it shares similar geological features with our planet, including valleys, mountains, and craters.  Understanding how Venus evolved so differently from Earth, despite their initial similarities, is crucial for our understanding of planetary science.\n\nLearning about Venus reveals both its differences and similarities to Earth, making it an intriguing area of study.  While many people may be unfamiliar with the specifics of this planet, its relative closeness and unique characteristics make it a prime candidate for continued exploration and research."}

I personally believe that companies should not produce these vehicles due to several potentially dangerous flaws.  Because these cars are programmed to strictly adhere to all traffic laws, paradoxically, they might cause more accidents.\n\nOne reason for this is the mixed traffic environment. Not everyone will own a driverless car, and human drivers are notorious for not always following the rules. An autonomous vehicle traveling at precisely the speed limit might not be able to react safely to a human driver behaving unpredictably, such as suddenly stopping or crossing the road illegally.\n\nAnother concern involves the potential for driver complacency.  Someone in a driverless car might fall asleep or become distracted, assuming the car will handle everything.  However, unforeseen circumstances could arise that require human intervention, and the driver might not be able to react quickly enough to take control, potentially leading to a serious accident or even fatalities."}

{"text": "Flattening the COVID-19 infection curve is crucial for preventing healthcare systems from being overwhelmed.  A flatter curve distributes the need for healthcare over time, keeping peak hospitalizations below capacity. This means fewer people require hospitalization simultaneously, reducing strain on resources.  Flattening is achieved through pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., vaccination, medicine) and non-pharmaceutical measures (e.g., social distancing, self-isolation, quarantine).  This concept is relevant not only for COVID-19 but for any virus-based epidemic.  Flattening the curve provides more time to prepare for patient influx and allows for better individualized care, ultimately reducing the burden on healthcare services.\n\nThe effectiveness of interventions, like targeted isolation, can be influenced by the underlying structure of social networks.  Recent studies have investigated COVID-19 spread using network science and graph theory [3, 7, 21, 32], even exploring the analogy of cyber-physical malware contagion [6].  These studies analyze epidemic dynamics considering network types (e.g., scale-free, clustered scale-free, small-world) and graph-theoretic properties (e.g., clustering, small-worldness, assortativity, preferential mixing, community structures).\n\nThis paper focuses on targeted isolation within small-world networks, modeled using the Watts-Strogatz (WS) model [44].  Characterized by high clustering (dense local connections) and short path lengths (efficient global reach), these networks mirror real-world social structures. We investigate whether these characteristics are advantageous for targeted interventions.  Specifically, we examine whether identifying and isolating central individuals based on centrality measures can effectively flatten the infection curve, as suggested by theoretical [3, 11] and real-world data [33].\n\nThe literature on network science and epidemic modeling is extensive.  Studies have shown that clustering can have varying effects on disease spread, sometimes accelerating it (co-infected diseases in non-clustered networks [18]) and sometimes hindering it (hierarchical networks [17], single infection outbreaks [19]).  Other research indicates that epidemics spread faster in networks with overlapping communities [37].  The impact of clustering has also been explored by comparing scale-free and clustered scale-free networks concerning infection curve flattening [11] and epidemic outbreaks [12].  Clustering's role is further evident in social network controllability [9], Ebola transmission [36], and respiratory infection epidemics [41].  Regarding the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, research suggests community lockdowns are less effective than self-isolation and social distancing [16].  While the effect of small-worldness on infection curve flattening remains largely unexplored, some studies have examined its influence on diffusion processes [29], herd immunization [40], and epidemic outbreaks [31].\n\nOur approach relates to, but is distinct from, network immunization.  While both aim to mitigate disease impact, they employ different strategies.  Infection curve flattening focuses on slowing overall spread through population-level measures. Network immunization targets key individuals within specific networks for preventative measures.  Both strategies, however, identify and target key individuals or behaviors driving transmission.  Our method can complement network immunization as part of a comprehensive disease control strategy.  For further understanding of network immunization, readers can refer to [12, 14, 15, 25, 26, 30, 40].  Other relevant works on network immunization and epidemic control include studies on community-based control [14], bond percolation models [27], comparison of immunization strategies [45], optimized targeted immunization [42], and mitigation in multi-layer networks [24, 47]."}

{"text": "Planning is a central problem in Artificial Intelligence, the objective of which is to generate a plan of actions at a symbolic level, starting from an initial state, to achieve a predefined goal [1]. However, planning in AI poses multiple challenges, particularly those related to the formalization and reasoning about actions, plans, change, time, and objectives.  It also raises issues related to robustness in handling partially known world states or non-deterministic actions, algorithmic problems in plan generation, and problems of execution control, reactivity to unforeseen environmental changes, and adaptation of existing plans.\n\nClassical planning experienced considerable growth due to the richness of modeling languages and the efficiency of plan generation systems.  Nevertheless, classical planning suffered from a weakness stemming from two strong simplifying assumptions:  the availability of perfect knowledge, at all times, of the system state and the effects of actions, and the certainty that changes in the system state result solely from the execution of planned actions. To address this weakness, the field of planning under uncertainty [2] emerged, proposing the integration of actions with probabilistic effects and then additive utility functions on goals, leading to a family of planning approaches based on decision theory [3] and using representation languages traditionally known in artificial intelligence: logic, constraints, or Bayesian networks.  The use of these representation languages led to a significant increase in the complexity of plan generation algorithms, the resolution of which became a challenge for the AI community. This is how the idea of using multi-agent systems arose among researchers.\n\nIndeed, extending planning to the multi-agent systems framework led to distributed planning [4], [11], in which the planning domain is distributed among a set of agents. These agents can be cooperative, meaning they share a common global objective and complementary capabilities to achieve it, or individualistic, meaning they have individual objectives that they can achieve without external assistance. In both cases, agents must be able to generate plans that allow the achievement of either sub-goals necessary for a global objective or individual objectives.  There is some existing work on distributed planning in the literature. We cite, among others, [177], [178], [179], [180].\n\nThe agent paradigm is becoming increasingly important for its ability to address complex systems characterized by indeterminism, emergence, and unpredictable evolution. It is very effective for managing the heterogeneous nature of a system's components, modeling interactions between these components, and attempting to understand the resulting emergent phenomena. This is linked to the fact that an agent possesses behavior, characterized mainly by four properties [5]:\n\n* **Autonomy or Proactivity:** The ability to act without external intervention; initiative-taking.\n* **Sensitivity:** The ability to perceive the environment or other agents.\n* **Locality:** Limitations in perception and actions.\n* **Flexibility:** Reaction to perceived changes.\n\nIndeed, an agent is not limited to reacting only to method invocations, as is often the case in the object paradigm, but also to any other observable change in its environment.  Taking these changes into account automatically translates into a set of new actions that the agent must execute. The determination of these actions depends on the nature of the agent [6].  For example, if the agent is rational, the actions to be determined must not conflict with the agent's utility function; if the agent is goal-oriented, these actions must not conflict with the agent's goal; if the agent is reactive with a model, these actions are predetermined by a set of rules, etc.\n\nThe agent's behavior thus offers advantages, but the new actions to be executed by the agent, in order to take into account the unpredictable changes that characterize its environment, can create a problem during distributed planning. In classical planning, the set of actions to be planned is defined beforehand and does not undergo any changes, thus ensuring the reliability of the generated plan until the end of its execution.  However, in distributed planning, each agent may experience changes in its set of actions to be planned, following unpredictable changes in its environment. Due to changes in the set of actions, the plan the agent was executing becomes obsolete because it does not consider the new actions the agent must execute to accommodate the unpredictable changes in its environment. The agent is therefore forced to generate a new plan. Consequently, the need for a dynamic planning approach that can generate new plans at any time, as changes occur, to take into account new actions becomes self-evident. This represents the focal point of our work, in which we propose a new dynamic distributed planning approach capable of taking into account changes that may occur in the set of actions to be planned. Our approach fits within the context of distributed planning for distributed plans where each agent can produce its own plans.  According to our approach, plan generation is based on constraint satisfaction using genetic algorithms."}

{"text": "Text recognition, the process of transcribing visual information into text, is a critical technology bridging vision and language.  Its applications are diverse, ranging from visual search to document digitization.\n\nDespite recent advancements in text recognition, challenges persist, particularly in recognizing fine-grained text categories with variations in fonts and colors.  This difficulty is compounded by the limited availability of labeled real-world data.  While synthetic data has been employed in previous studies (e.g., [12, 20, 36, 44, 45, 60]) with some success, the performance gap between synthetic and real-world data remains a significant hurdle.\n\nTo mitigate the reliance on labeled real-world data, researchers have explored pre-training techniques, broadly categorized into two approaches: strengthening visual representations using unlabeled real images and incorporating language priors with a language model.  Some studies (e.g., [32, 58]) have leveraged contrastive learning and masked image modeling with large unlabeled image datasets to enhance visual representations.  Others (e.g., [12, 41]) have utilized pre-trained language models to guide or correct recognition model predictions.  While these methods have shown promise by incorporating visual or linguistic priors, they suffer from two key limitations. First, they often focus exclusively on either visual or linguistic knowledge, neglecting the inherent interplay of both within text images. This narrow focus can lead to reduced accuracy. Second, some previous approaches (e.g., [12, 41]) introduce language priors through a detached language model, preventing gradient flow between the recognition and language models and potentially hindering optimal performance.\n\nThis paper proposes a novel approach that leverages both visual and linguistic priors through pre-training to enhance text recognition performance.  We unify vision and language pre-training within a classical encoder-decoder framework.  Specifically, we pre-train the feature encoder on a large set of unlabeled real text images using masked image modeling, enabling the extraction of richer visual representations through self-supervision.  Concurrently, we directly pre-train the sequence decoder to improve its language modeling capabilities.\n\nTo achieve this unified pre-training, we first transform a text corpus into synthetic text images, aligning data modalities.

First, it can identify a range of emotions like happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This awareness can foster empathy among students, helping them understand and respond kindly to their classmates' feelings.  It can also promote self-awareness, allowing students to recognize and manage their own emotions more effectively.\n\nSecond, this technology can detect confusion and boredom.  This allows teachers to identify students who need extra help and adjust their teaching to keep students engaged and motivated.  By recognizing these subtle cues, teachers can gain valuable insights into their students' learning experiences and identify potential challenges they might be facing both inside and outside the classroom.\n\nFinally, by understanding students' emotional states, teachers can significantly improve communication and build stronger relationships. They can offer appropriate support, whether it's providing space and time for a struggling student or engaging in a conversation to help process difficult emotions. This understanding can also empower teachers to incorporate lessons on emotional regulation and resilience, creating a more positive and supportive learning environment.  Ultimately, this technology has the potential to benefit both teachers and students, fostering a more empathetic, responsive, and effective classroom."}

{"text": "Federated Learning (FL) [35] allows a set of clients to collaboratively solve a machine learning problem coordinated by a central server.  Clients retain their data locally for privacy, sharing only model parameters periodically.  While existing research addresses FL challenges like user privacy [35, 39, 53], communication cost [17, 21, 31, 50, 55], and data heterogeneity [5, 13, 20, 29, 54], a critical issue remains largely unexplored: the impact of noisy labels in user data.  Manual annotation often introduces incorrect labels, which existing FL algorithms like FedAvg [35] fail to account for, treating all samples equally.  This leads to overfitting on noisy labels and poor generalization performance.  Developing robust algorithms is challenging because data privacy prevents the server from directly verifying label quality.  While recent approaches [8, 52, 59] utilize clean validation sets, this paper introduces a novel approach, formally framing the noisy label problem as a bilevel optimization problem and providing two efficient algorithms with guaranteed convergence.\n\nOur approach identifies noisy labels based on their contribution to training, measured using a Shapley value-inspired [46] approach.  For each sample 𝑠 in dataset D, we compare the generalization performance of a model trained on subset S ⊂ D/{𝑠} to a model trained on 𝑆 ∪ {𝑠}.  The difference reflects label quality: correct labels improve generalization, while mislabeled samples hinder it.  The Shapley value, averaging this difference over all possible subsets S, quantifies a sample's contribution.  However, its NP-hard computation necessitates an alternative.  We introduce sample weights, transforming the problem into finding optimal weights for generalization performance.  This results in a bilevel optimization problem [44, 48, 56] with inner and outer problem levels.  While efficient gradient-based algorithms [15, 18, 26] exist for non-distributed bilevel problems, efficient FL-specific solutions remain unexplored. The key challenge lies in evaluating the hypergradient (gradient with respect to the outer problem variable) in the FL setting."}
{"text": "The \"Face on Mars\" has captivated the public imagination since NASA first unveiled an image that appeared to show a human-like face on the Martian surface.  This image fueled speculation about alien civilizations and even starred in movies, talk shows, and magazines. Many people strongly believed it was an alien monument. Others argued it was merely a natural landform, unintentionally appearing facial.\n\nAs a scientist, I subscribe to the latter explanation.  The initial image, taken by the Viking spacecraft, lacked the resolution to definitively determine the nature of the formation. However, on April 5th, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor, equipped with the higher-resolution Mars Orbiter Camera, flew over the Cydonia region where the \"face\" is located.  Michael Malin and his team captured an image ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.  Thousands of people anxiously awaited the release of this image on a JPL website."}

{"text": "Are driverless cars a good idea? I believe they are not, due to safety concerns, cost, and legal hurdles.\n\nFirst, safety remains a significant concern.  The article raises the critical question of liability: \"If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault—the driver or the manufacturer?\"  It also mentions that driverless cars use light signals to indicate traffic jams and other safety issues. However, what happens if a human driver is distracted and doesn't react to these signals in time?  What if the signals malfunction?  Furthermore, potential issues like malfunctioning anti-lock brakes add to these concerns.  There are simply too many potential points of failure to guarantee safety on the road.\n\nSecond, the cost of implementing driverless car technology is prohibitive.  The article points out that these vehicles often require \"smart roads\" with extensive infrastructure upgrades: \"These smart roads systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical.\"  This cost would inevitably be passed on to consumers, making these supposedly \"eco-saving\" cars unaffordable for many. The article continues, \"Without the option of smarter roads, manufacturers turned to smarter cars...\"  Even shifting the technological burden to the vehicles themselves results in significantly higher manufacturing costs, ultimately driving up the price for consumers.  The expense of these \"smart\" cars outweighs any potential benefits.\n\nThird, legal restrictions hinder the widespread adoption of driverless cars. Some states require \"a human driver in control at all times.\" This demonstrates a lack of trust in fully autonomous vehicles, even if the technology were perfected.  The article notes that other \"states will follow as soon as the cars are proven reliably safe.\"  This cautious approach underscores the prevailing skepticism about the safety and reliability of driverless technology."}

{"text": "Des figures du mouvement prodémocratie de Hong Kong risquent la prison.  Mardi, trois vétérans du mouvement et six co-prévenus ont été reconnus coupables de \"troubles à l'ordre public\" pour leur rôle dans les manifestations monstres de 2014, surnommées la \"révolte des parapluies\".  Ces manifestations, qui avaient paralysé l'ex-colonie britannique pendant plus de deux mois, réclamaient à Pékin des réformes politiques et un suffrage universel libre pour l'élection du chef du gouvernement local.\n\nParmi les condamnés figurent Chan Kin-man, 60 ans, professeur de sociologie, Benny Tai, 54 ans, professeur de droit, et Chu Yiu-ming, 75 ans, pasteur baptiste.  Ces trois hommes sont les fondateurs du mouvement \"Occupy Central\", créé en 2013.  Ils ont été reconnus coupables de conspiration en vue de commettre un trouble à l'ordre public. MM. Tai et Chan ont également été condamnés pour incitation à commettre un trouble à l'ordre public, mais ont été relaxés du chef \"d'incitation à inciter\" à de tels troubles.  Chaque prévenu encourt jusqu'à sept ans de prison en vertu de la \"Common law\", l'ancien système britannique fondé sur la jurisprudence.  L'accusation a choisi cette voie plutôt que le code pénal classique, où les peines encourues n'auraient été que de trois mois.  On ignore quand les sentences seront prononcées.\n\nLe but initial d'\"Occupy\" était de bloquer le quartier d'affaires si Pékin refusait d'instaurer un suffrage universel libre.  Cependant, le mouvement étudiant et la jeunesse ont pris l'ampleur, et la situation a dégénéré lorsque la police a utilisé du gaz lacrymogène contre les manifestants, qui se sont protégés avec des parapluies, donnant son nom à la révolte.\n\nCe procès a été dénoncé par les défenseurs des droits de l'homme, comme Amnesty International et Human Rights Watch, qui le qualifient de politique et s'inquiètent des restrictions de libertés à Hong Kong.  Ils estiment que l'utilisation de chefs d'inculpation mal définis sur les troubles à l'ordre public menace la liberté d'expression.  Man-kei Tam, directeur d'Amnesty Hong Kong, souligne le danger croissant de poursuites pour militantisme pacifique et la volonté des autorités d'étouffer le débat sur les sujets sensibles comme la démocratie et l'autonomie.\n\nLe juge Johnny Chan a rejeté ces arguments, affirmant que sa décision n'aurait pas d'impact sur le droit de manifester et que les manifestations en question sortaient du cadre légal de la liberté d'expression en raison de leur caractère déraisonnablement nuisible.  L'accusation a soutenu que les manifestations avaient causé du tort aux habitants en bloquant la circulation.\n\nMalgré la condamnation, les trois vétérans sont restés déterminés.  Arrivés au tribunal de Kowloon West,  M. Tai a déclaré :  \"Peu importe ce qu'il se passe aujourd'hui, je suis sûr que beaucoup de gens vont se rassembler et continuer à lutter pour la démocratie à Hong Kong. Nous allons persévérer, nous n'allons pas jeter l'éponge\".  Chan Kin-man a ajouté : \"Je crois toujours au pouvoir de l'amour et de la paix. Je n'ai aucun regret pour ce que j'ai fait\".  Ce procès illustre les tensions croissantes entre Hong Kong, qui jouit théoriquement de libertés garanties par le principe \"Un pays, deux systèmes\", et l'emprise grandissante de Pékin.  Depuis la rétrocession en 1997, de nombreux militants ont été poursuivis, emprisonnés, ou empêchés de se présenter aux élections."}

The slogan no longer accurately represents Santa Cruz and has sparked debate about the city's identity.\n\nSanta Cruz needs a new slogan.  Locals have suggested alternatives like \"Keep Santa Cruz Natural\" or \"Keep Santa Cruz Safe.\"  Recently, local artists created an art project titled \"We Are Santa Cruz,\" a title that embodies the positive spirit of the community.

Attributes, such as clothing color and type, offer human-understandable semantics and have been used as mid-level ReID features [18].  However, no existing method leverages attributes to explain ReID results.  This paper aims to develop an attribute-guided interpreter to answer two key questions: 1) which attributes differentiate two individuals, and 2) how much each attribute contributes to this difference, as visualized in Figure 1(b).  Such an interpreter can help users focus on key discrepancies and aid developers in improving ReID accuracy, as shown in Figure 1(c).\n\nInterpreting ReID models with attributes presents unique challenges.  The distance-based output of ReID models complicates the use of class activation or gradients for visualization and semantic disentanglement, unlike classification tasks [24, 47].  The diverse and imbalanced nature of real-world attributes [7, 15, 18] can introduce biases, with prominent attributes like coats potentially overshadowing smaller yet discriminative attributes like hats.  Furthermore, the availability of only weakly-annotated image-level or ID-level attribute labels, without precise bounding boxes or masks [18], hinders accurate attribute localization and visualization.\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose Attribute-guided Metric Distillation, a post-hoc method for explainable person ReID.  We introduce a pluggable interpreter network that leverages knowledge from a target ReID model via metric distillation.  This interpreter, grafted onto the target model, inherits the initial CNN stages to utilize low-level and mid-level features.  The remaining layers incorporate an attribute decomposition head, enabling the generation of attribute-guided attention maps (AAMs) for input image pairs.  These AAMs visualize discriminative attributes and decompose visual features and distances into attribute-guided components, quantifying each attribute's contribution to the overall distance."}
{"text": "Depuis les années 1980, les pays du Maghreb subissent des invasions périodiques de criquets pèlerins, un phénomène inédit auparavant.  Si cela évoque les dix plaies d'Égypte, ces invasions ne sont en rien une malédiction : les criquets sont comestibles et appréciés des volailles.\n\nAutrefois, en Algérie par exemple, les criquets pèlerins arrivaient en été.  Attirés la nuit par les lampadaires, ils s'y brûlaient les ailes ou se jetaient dans les feux nocturnes.  Au petit matin, les poulets se régalaient de ces insectes grillés.\n\nOr, les nouvelles générations de criquets semblent moins sensibles à la lumière et au feu, témoignant peut-être d'une mutation ou d'une manipulation génétique en laboratoire occidental.\n\nL'Algérie a notamment été envahie par des nuées de sauterelles porteuses de puces RFID pour le téléguidage, placées sur l'abdomen, près de la tête et sur les pattes. Certaines arboraient des étiquettes numérotées à 9 ou 13 chiffres, semblables à des codes-barres.  Si certains laboratoires occidentaux ont reconnu marquer des insectes pour étudier leurs déplacements,  le nombre d'individus marqués (près de 20 % de la population de criquets) interroge.  En 1991,  sous le gouvernement des généraux Nezzar et Toufik, pendant la période des massacres imputés aux GIA (Groupes Islamiques Armés),  le gouvernement algérien a combattu ces sauterelles avec des insecticides présentés comme inoffensifs pour la population.  Or, ces pulvérisations, qui ont duré des mois, ont rendu les criquets impropres à la consommation,  condamnant les élevages de volailles.  Une opération similaire s'est déroulée simultanément en Californie, suggérant une possible orchestration conjointe de la France, des États-Unis, d'Israël (via le Mossad), du Maroc et de généraux algériens.\n\nContrôler un essaim de criquets pèlerins est relativement simple : il suffit d'équiper quelques individus meneurs pour que la colonie, grégaire par nature, les suive.  Dès 2006, l'Agence américaine des programmes de recherches avancée de défense (DARPA) explore le contrôle électronique d'insectes.  Fin 2012, en collaboration avec l'université de Caroline du Nord, elle a présenté un cafard de Madagascar \"piloté\" par impulsions électroniques.\n\nLa chute de Kadhafi a eu des conséquences inattendues, au-delà de la prolifération des armes. L'afflux massif de criquets pèlerins dans les pays du Sahel en est une.  Dans un communiqué du 5 juin, la FAO (Organisation des Nations unies pour l'alimentation et l'agriculture) tire la sonnette d'alarme. Malgré les efforts de l'Algérie et de la Libye depuis mi-mai (des infestations acridiennes y ont été signalées en janvier), les criquets progressent vers le Mali et le Niger, menaçant les cultures.  Comme l'expliquait \"Jeune Afrique\" le 10 juin, le régime de Kadhafi possédait un système anti-acridien performant. La révolution l'a démantelé et la lutte contre les criquets n'est pas une priorité pour les nouvelles autorités.\n\nLa Commission de lutte contre le criquet pèlerin dans la région occidentale (CLCPRO, un comité interrégional de la FAO créé en 2002 regroupant 11 pays du Maghreb et du Sahel) redouble d'efforts.  Fin mai, des essaims ont été signalés au Niger (régions d'Arlit et d'Agadez).  Des équipes ont été déployées pour enrayer la reproduction des insectes, favorisée par des pluies précoces. 700 hectares ont été traités, mais les essaims se dirigent vers le sud,  mettant en péril 500 000 hectares de cultures.\n\n[Photo d'un criquet pèlerin en Mauritanie en 2004, publiée sur Flickr par la Sopfcim (Société de protection des forêts contre les insectes et maladies).]\n\nCes efforts resteront vains si le Mali, membre de la CLCPRO, n'agit pas.  Or, la présence de groupes armés au nord du Mali, zone de reproduction des criquets, empêche l'accès des autorités et de la FAO.\n\nLa dernière invasion, entre 2003 et 2005, conjuguée à une sécheresse sévère, avait provoqué une famine dramatique au Niger en 2005, touchant 3 millions de personnes, dont 800 000 enfants.  Déjà confronté à une crise alimentaire (mauvaises récoltes de 2011), le Niger risque de subir des conséquences catastrophiques."}

{"text": "The increasing availability of electronic healthcare records, containing both patient state and clinician actions, has opened opportunities to use machine learning to model clinical decision-making policies. Consequently, off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) for optimal sequential clinical decisions has become a leading approach for AI-based interventions (Komorowski, 2018; Gottesman et al., 2019).  RL generally demonstrates promising performance, with the potential to surpass human experts when tested on retrospective or simulated data (Ernst et al., 2006; Bothe et al., 2013; Lowery & Faisal, 2013; Li et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020).  Initial RL-derived systems, autonomously intervening on patients, have been successfully deployed in controlled rehabilitation settings (Wannawas et al., 2021). However, hospital-based RL-driven interventions at the bedside carry greater risks due to patient health status and the potential negative impact of interventions. Therefore, there is a growing need to prioritize the development of inherently risk- and safety-aware RL systems for healthcare. This requires RL algorithms to account for noise and uncertainty in their operation and to make these critical performance factors interrogatable, allowing developers, regulators, and users to specify safety and trust margins.\n\nSepsis treatment in critical care is one area where RL has shown significant potential.  Sepsis is responsible for nearly a third of patient deaths (Stevenson et al., 2014), yet optimal decision-making policies remain unclear. RL methods applied to retrospective data have yielded promising results, potentially identifying individualized and clinically effective treatment decisions that could significantly reduce mortality (Komorowski, 2018). In this context, the RL agent's actions (sometimes referred to as the \"AI Clinician\") are communicated as recommendations (through a clinical decision support system, or CDSS) to a human expert, such as a critical care clinician, who can then choose to implement or disregard them. This intensive care application has rapidly become a popular use case for RL in healthcare, partly due to the public availability of high-density, high-quality datasets and the immediate utility of RL compared to supervised learning. Consequently, clinical trials of RL systems are expanding, but limitations in interpretability, safety, and trust must be addressed before widespread deployment can be considered.\n\nTwo primary sources of uncertainty limit the capability of an RL agent's optimal policy. First, noise or randomness inherent in the dynamics of both the patient's condition and the agent's actions introduces uncertainty. This aleatoric uncertainty (from the Latin *alea* for \"dice\") can be measured by repeating the same action and observing trial-to-trial variability (Faisal et al., 2008). It captures the inherent randomness in the system, including physiological processes, treatment effects, and healing outcomes—factors the agent can mitigate but not directly control.  In healthcare, many interventions have probabilistic outcomes, and it's crucial for stakeholders to understand whether a proposed outcome's success is influenced by chance.\n\nSecond, epistemic uncertainty (from the Greek *episteme* for \"knowledge\") reflects how well the model has learned from finite data and how well it can fit the problem.  In healthcare, this could indicate limited data for specific state-space regions or state transitions, such as encountering a new disease or prescribing a drug infrequently used for a particular patient type. Epistemic uncertainty is crucial for recommender system safety, allowing stakeholders to weigh AI recommendations against human judgment or seek expert opinions.\n\nConventional RL models typically do not provide access to these two types of uncertainty.  Even advanced probabilistic RL models, such as Bayesian RL (Ghavamzadeh et al., 2016) and distributional reinforcement learning (Bellemare et al., 2017), often confound or conflate them.  However, decomposing these components would significantly benefit the interpretation of RL agent treatment recommendations. For example, high aleatoric but low epistemic uncertainty in a given state would suggest inherent stochasticity, warranting heightened clinician attention. Conversely, high epistemic uncertainty would indicate insufficient data or model convergence, signaling that the model's output should be treated with caution."}

{"text": "Venus: A Worthy Pursuit Despite the Dangers\n\nVenus, often called the \"Evening Star,\" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, easily spotted by even amateur stargazers.  This striking celestial body, frequently referred to as Earth's twin due to its similar size and density, and occasionally its proximity, deserves our attention and further exploration. While undertaking such a mission presents undeniable risks, the potential rewards of understanding our closest planetary neighbor are immense.\n\nThe question arises: why invest our time and resources in exploring Venus?  The answer lies in the tantalizing possibilities it holds.  Venus possesses features analogous to Earth, including a rocky surface with valleys, mountains, and craters. This similarity sparks curiosity about the planet's composition and history, including the potential for shared geological materials between Earth and Venus.  Furthermore, the very presence of these familiar features raises intriguing questions about the potential for other, yet undiscovered, similarities.\n\nBefore sending humans, however, a preliminary robotic mission is crucial.  A demo rover could assess unforeseen hazards and gather further data on the planet's surface and atmosphere.  This information would be invaluable in preparing a safe and effective human mission.\n\nWhile Venus presents seemingly survivable conditions for humans in its upper atmosphere, with plentiful solar power and manageable radiation levels according to some studies, significant challenges remain.  The planet's incredibly dense atmosphere, composed almost entirely of carbon dioxide, and its extreme temperatures, hot enough to liquefy metal and crush deep-sea submarines, pose considerable obstacles.  These dangers necessitate careful planning and technological innovation to ensure the safety of any human explorers.\n\nDespite these challenges, the potential benefits of a Venus mission are compelling.  Further study could unveil new information about planetary formation, the evolution of atmospheres, and perhaps even the potential for life beyond Earth.  The author's argument for Venus exploration as a \"worthy pursuit despite the dangers\" is supported by the planet's unique characteristics, the possibility of scientific breakthroughs, and the inherent human drive to explore and understand the universe around us.  By taking measured steps, beginning with robotic exploration and culminating in carefully planned human missions, the United States, through collaborative scientific efforts, could achieve a significant victory in space exploration and expand our understanding of our place in the cosmos."}

{"text": "Southampton's comeback from two goals down against Burnley on Sunday might have looked fortunate, but underlying data reveals they deserved the win.  Their Fantasy Premier League Threat score, which measures the quality of goalscoring chances, reached a gameweek 30 high of 352.

{"text": "Semantic textual similarity (STS) and information retrieval (IR) tasks have been principal measures for tracking the progress of dense representation models (Agirre et al., 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016; Cer et al., 2017; Thakur et al., 2021).  While STS remains a common evaluation metric in sentence representation research, it is known for its limited real-world applicability (Neelakantan et al., 2022; Muennighoff et al., 2023b), inherent ambiguity (Deshpande et al., 2023), and performance orthogonality with IR and other downstream tasks (Reimers et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2023a).\n\nIn the era of large language models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020; Neelakantan et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2023) has become a favored alternative to standard end-to-end generative language models (OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023). This shift is driven by LLMs' inherent weaknesses regarding factual errors stemming from hallucinations (Ji et al., 2023), outdated knowledge (Vu et al., 2023), limitations with long-tailed knowledge (Kandpal et al., 2023; Malaviya et al., 2023), and reasoning failures, such as in logical deduction (Berglund et al., 2023).\n\nRAG is employed differently across various NLP tasks:\n\n* **Knowledge-Intensive Tasks:** RAG retrieves up-to-date and reliable knowledge references (Vu et al., 2023; Malaviya et al., 2023), which serve as new prompts for LLMs to extract information and formulate responses. This mitigates hallucinations (Ji et al., 2023) and reduces the need for frequent LLM fine-tuning.\n* **Reasoning-Dependent Tasks:** RAG fetches the most relevant chunks from extensive inputs to guide LLM focus, for example, in multi-hop question answering where reasoning across multiple documents is required.  Reasoning with such long contexts is challenging even for LLMs with extended context windows, and impossible for those with shorter ones (Xu et al., 2023).\n\nDespite the promise of dense retrievers for knowledge-intensive tasks, they struggle to retrieve reliable and cite-worthy references (Malaviya et al., 2023) compared to state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs used independently (OpenAI, 2023). This highlights a weakness in retrievers' ability to assist LLMs.  This discrepancy is amplified in reasoning-intensive tasks, where RAG often shows inconsistent gains or even performance degradation compared to standalone LLMs (Bai et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023).\n\nGiven the complex role of dense representation models in the LLM era, accurately assessing their advanced language understanding capabilities is crucial."}
{"text": "Identifying conserved quantities has significant practical applications, driving decades of research in applied mathematics.  This work presents a novel data-driven methodology for learning the symbolic forms of conservation laws, minimizing data requirements and automating parameter selection.\n\nTraditional approaches for discovering conservation laws include analytical methods, such as solving linear systems derived from stoichiometric matrices [2, 3, 4] for linear relations and employing more sophisticated techniques for nonlinear ones [5]. Lie group theory has also been extensively used [6, 7, 8, 9, 10].  Computationally, algorithms like manifold learning [11] and AI-Poincaré 2.0 [12] learn conservation laws from dynamical system inputs.  The Sparse Invariant Detector (SID) [13] offers a non-black-box linear algebraic approach.\n\nHowever, with the rise of data-driven modeling, the challenge lies in recovering conservation laws *without* a priori knowledge of system dynamics. Existing data-driven methods range from specialized approaches for Hamiltonian functions [14, 15] to more general neural network-based techniques like AI-Poincaré [16] and ConservNet [17].  Other approaches leverage deep neural nets with Noether's theorem [18], manifold learning with optimal transport [19], and machine learning to identify both conservation laws and dynamical system structure [20]. Koopman theory combined with data-driven regression provides symbolic representations [1].  These methods typically require between 100 [20] and over 1000 data points [12], with higher-order systems potentially needing more.  Robustness to noise remains a key challenge.\n\nThis paper adopts an SVD-based null space estimation method, offering robustness and lower data requirements.  Often, as few as 20 points suffice for accurate recovery, even with substantial noise.  Beyond minimizing data needs, the method learns the *functional form* of the conservation law(s), a feature shared with the sparse identification paradigm used in [1].  Challenges associated with this approach include choosing appropriate functional libraries and optimality thresholds.\n\nTo address these challenges, we develop a unified data-driven approach for automatically selecting the optimal learning library and polynomial degree.  This approach utilizes a sequence of data transformations, including SVD decomposition and echelon form reduction, letting the data guide the identification of the singular value gap and inform subsequent optimization parameter selection.  The method's effectiveness is demonstrated on various problems, including multiple and nonlinear conservation laws, with applications in physics and biology.\n\nOur proposed methodology offers two key advantages: (1) robust discovery of conservation laws with minimal data, even in the presence of noise and without knowledge of underlying dynamics, and (2) automated selection of optimal libraries and thresholds based on estimated noise and the singular values of the library matrix.  Due to the ease of SVD and LU-based implementation, this framework integrates well with other learning approaches."}

I opened it to find Don Reist, who invited me to Europe on a cattle boat. I couldn't refuse.\n\nIt was 1945. World War II raged in Europe, leaving many countries devastated.  These ravaged nations desperately needed supplies and food, aid that I and others would deliver.\n\nForty-four nations united to form the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). The organization hired \"Seagoing Cowboys\" to care for the horses, cows, and mules being shipped overseas. Don and I signed up for the job.\n\nWe arrived on August 14th, the day the war in the Pacific ended.  Don and I received our seaman's papers and boarded the SS *Charles W.

Our cargo: 335 horses and their feed.\n\nBeing 18 was precarious; I could have been drafted.\n\nBy my discharge in 1947, I had completed nine trips—the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. The cattle trips were incredible, yet demanding.  Crossing the Atlantic from the eastern United States took about two weeks, plus we cared for and fed the animals three times a day.\n\nHelping on my Aunt Katie's farm had prepared me somewhat for the work, but not for the dangers we faced.\n\nLife on board was also enjoyable.

It's crucial to understand and value what matters to others.  Some might find entertainment in observing conflict, but witnessing our allies embroiled in war while we remain passive is deeply unsettling.\n\nHelping others generates a cycle of support.  This could manifest in practical assistance, like help with a building project, or in shared experiences, such as preparing a meal together.  Regardless of the form it takes, offering assistance is inherently the right course of action.

People consistently prioritize the needs of their families, friends, and even pets.  Failing to address these crucial needs can lead to regrettable choices in the future.\n\nLuke's aid during World War II demonstrates this principle in action.  Countless individuals in that conflict sacrificed their lives to protect what they held dear.  Similarly, many would willingly make the ultimate sacrifice for loved ones."}
{"text": "I disagree with the concept of driverless cars.  Primarily, I believe they are inherently dangerous. The requirement for a driver to remain alert negates the very purpose of autonomous driving.  Alerts designed to recapture the driver's attention shouldn't be necessary. If a car is truly driverless, it should function without any human intervention.\n\nWhile I understand the appeal for long road trips, where one person typically bears the burden of driving, and the desire for drivers to rest, the safety implications are concerning.  Even if a sleeping driver is alerted to an impending accident, their reaction time and judgment could be severely impaired.  Expecting someone roused from sleep to instantly take control in a critical situation is unrealistic.  They might panic and exacerbate the situation, leading to further collisions. The potential for catastrophic failures with driverless technology is simply too high.\n\nWhile many anticipate the widespread adoption of such technology, I'm reminded of the dystopian future portrayed in the movie Wall-E, where people became obese and indolent due to reliance on automated systems.  Do we really want to follow that trajectory?  The United States already struggles with obesity, and eliminating the need to drive will further reduce opportunities for even minimal physical activity.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe driverless cars are a misguided innovation."}
{"text": "Ever felt bored in class, wishing for something more engaging than a tedious lecture?  Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology offers a potential solution. By recognizing facial expressions and interpreting emotions, FACS can revolutionize the classroom. It can gauge student interest, identify when a spark is needed, and even adjust the lesson's pace if a student becomes confused or frustrated.\n\nEmerging technologies like FACS hold immense potential for education.  This system could significantly improve student performance and foster genuine interest in learning.  As noted by its creator, Dr. Paul Ekman,  \"Six basic emotions—happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness—are associated with characteristic facial muscle movements.\"  This classification system forms the foundation of FACS, enabling it to recognize student engagement levels and provide valuable feedback to teachers.\n\nThis technology could also pinpoint students struggling due to disinterest. Dr. Huang suggests, \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" This adaptability could dramatically alter how students learn, catering to individual needs and preventing boredom by instantly adjusting the lesson.\n\nConfusion, anger, and even depression can significantly impact a child's learning.  FACS could identify these emotional states, potentially alerting school counselors when a student needs support.  Dr. Huang emphasizes the importance of nonverbal communication, stating, \"Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, so computers need to understand that, too.\"  This implies that FACS could also help students struggling with issues they might be hesitant to discuss, such as family problems affecting their schoolwork. By recognizing signs of depression, the system could help connect these students with necessary support."}

{"text": "Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm enabling collaborative model training across numerous devices without direct data sharing, driven by the increasing prevalence of machine learning in the Internet of Things (McMahan et al. 2017; Imteaj et al. 2022).  Traditional FL employs a parameter-server (PS) architecture where a central server aggregates models and broadcasts updates (Kairouz et al. 2019). However, this centralized approach suffers from communication bottlenecks and potential server vulnerabilities (Lian et al. 2017).\n\nDecentralized learning offers a promising alternative, utilizing peer-to-peer communication for faster convergence (Lian et al. 2017, 2018).  In this framework, each worker maintains a local model copy and collaborates with neighbors to achieve a consensus model.  However, data heterogeneity, a common challenge in both centralized and decentralized learning, can hinder performance. When data distributions vary significantly across workers, a single shared model may perform poorly on individual devices. Consequently, personalized decentralized learning, where each worker learns a tailored model (Vanhaesebrouck, Bellet, and Tommasi 2017; Dai et al. 2022), becomes crucial.\n\nThis paper advances personalized decentralized learning by leveraging the concept of shared representations.  Inspired by observations in centralized learning (Bengio, Courville, and Vincent 2013; LeCun, Bengio, and Hinton 2015), we exploit the idea that heterogeneous data, even with different labels, can share a common low-dimensional representation.  Following the pioneering work of Collins et al. (2021) in the centralized setting, we extend this principle to decentralized learning.  We propose that each worker's model comprises a shared global representation map (ϕ: R<sup>d</sup> → R<sup>z</sup>) and a personalized local head (θ<sub>i</sub>: R<sup>z</sup> → Y), where z ≪ d.  This structure simplifies local optimization of the worker-specific heads. While Collins et al. (2021) analyzed linear global representations, we address the open questions of developing a fully decentralized algorithm for the general non-linear case and providing its convergence analysis.\n\nSpecifically, we introduce DePRL, a decentralized algorithm that alternates updates between global representation and local head parameters to solve the optimization problem min<sub>ϕ∈Φ</sub> (1/N) Σ<sup>N</sup><sub>i=1</sub> min<sub>θi∈Θ</sub> F<sub>i</sub>(θ<sub>i</sub> • ϕ), where F<sub>i</sub>(•) represents worker i's loss function.  In each round, workers update their local head and global representation using stochastic gradient descent, share updated global representations with neighbors, and compute a weighted average to achieve consensus.\n\nUnlike conventional decentralized learning with a single shared model (Lian et al. 2017, 2018; Assran et al. 2019), DePRL involves coupled updates of local head and global representation parameters, requiring novel proof techniques for convergence analysis.  Our contributions are threefold:\n\n* **DePRL Algorithm:** We introduce DePRL, the first fully decentralized algorithm that learns a shared global representation and personalized local heads for improved performance in heterogeneous data environments.\n\n* **Convergence Rate:** We establish a new notion of ϵ-approximation solution and provide the first convergence analysis for personalized decentralized learning with shared non-linear representations. We demonstrate a convergence rate of O(1/√NK), where N is the number of workers and K is a sufficiently large number of communication rounds, indicating a linear speedup with respect to the number of workers. This result, highly desirable for large-scale decentralized systems, also guarantees consensus on the shared global representation while maintaining personalized local heads, offering insights into generalization to unseen workers.\n\n* **Evaluation:**  We empirically validate DePRL's performance and theoretical findings through experiments on various datasets with representative DNN models, demonstrating superior performance in heterogeneous settings compared to existing baselines."}

{"text": "The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) offers potential benefits in the classroom.  By analyzing students' facial expressions, FACS could identify confusion, boredom, or engagement with the lesson.  This has practical applications, particularly for students who hesitate to ask for help.  For instance, a classroom computer equipped with FACS could recognize a confused or bored student, prompting the teacher to offer assistance. This would be particularly helpful for students who, despite struggling, might not outwardly seek clarification. FACS could also provide valuable feedback, allowing teachers to adjust their lessons based on student engagement levels.  Imagine a scenario where a teacher, alerted by the system, proactively modifies their approach to re-engage a bored class.\n\nHowever, the use of FACS raises valid privacy concerns.  Many students already express unease about being watched, evidenced by the number who cover their laptop cameras. Even those who dismiss such concerns might feel uncomfortable knowing their expressions are constantly monitored.  This discomfort, shared by some parents, could create resistance to FACS implementation.\n\nWhile FACS offers intriguing pedagogical possibilities, student and parent comfort levels are paramount.  Ultimately, fostering an environment where students feel comfortable expressing their needs and feedback directly remains crucial.  While technology can play a supporting role, it shouldn't replace open communication between students and teachers."}
{"text": "For over thirty years, the question of the Face on Mars has lingered: alien artifact or natural landform?  Despite intense media scrutiny, evidence overwhelmingly supports the scientific conclusion that the Face is a natural formation, much like a butte or mesa common in the American West, contrary to the claims of conspiracy theorists.\n\nNASA's Viking 1 orbiter first captured the formation in 1976, describing it as \"an enormous head nearly two miles from end to end.\"  A few days later, when NASA released the image to the public, speculation about alien life ignited.  As the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" explains, \"The 'Face on Mars' had since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows—even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!\"  The article continues, \"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars—evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.\"  The media amplified the idea of extraterrestrial intelligence, often disregarding scientists' explanations.\n\nEighteen years after the Viking missions concluded, the Mars Global Surveyor, a Mars orbiter, flew over Cydonia (the region where the Face is located) for the first time. The orbiter team captured an image ten times sharper than the original Viking photographs.  These photos revealed a natural landform, not an alien monument.  On April 5, 1998, during a cloudless summer day on Mars, the Mars Global Surveyor passed over Cydonia again, close enough for the orbiter team to acquire an exceptionally detailed image using the camera's maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image represented 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photograph.\n\nJim Garvin, chief scientist of NASA's exploration program, explained, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\"  The image of the Face actually depicts the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" Garvin noted. \"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\""}

{"text": "Imagine a computer that can detect your emotions – whether you're happy, sad, or confused. This isn't science fiction; it's the potential of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology. While the idea of emotion-reading technology might seem intriguing on a personal level, its value truly shines in the classroom.\n\nDeveloped with the help of Professors Thomas Huang and Nicu Sebe, FACS can benefit not only students but also teachers and administrators. As mentioned in paragraph six of the original text, a classroom computer equipped with FACS could recognize student boredom or confusion.  Imagine you're having a bad day and face a daunting five-page essay.  While you might try to hide your frustration, this technology could subtly inform your teacher of your emotional state, allowing them to adjust accordingly, perhaps postponing the assignment to a better time.\n\nThis technology offers a significant advantage in understanding student engagement. Teachers could gain insight into how students genuinely feel about an activity or project.  What the teacher perceives as engaging might actually bore the students, leading to decreased effort and suboptimal learning.\n\nBeyond the classroom, this technology has applications in online advertising.  Paragraph six also mentions how online ads can adapt to your reactions. If you smile at a web ad, a similar one might appear next.  Frown, and the advertisement changes. This principle, applied to classroom computers and iPads, could personalize the learning experience and filter out distracting or irrelevant content.  While pop-up ads are often dismissed as annoying, the ability to tailor them to individual emotional responses could transform them into a more useful tool.\n\n\nThis technology holds promise for improving the learning environment and personalizing digital experiences.  It allows for a deeper understanding of individual emotional responses, paving the way for more responsive and effective educational strategies."}

Personne n’en est satisfait, et particulièrement les membres de la Convention Citoyenne pour le Climat, censés en être à l’origine.  Ébaubis, ces 150 citoyens ont réalisé avoir servi un nouveau coup de communication à Emmanuel Macron.  Face à cette injustice, ils ont manifesté début mai pour dénoncer le fait que seule une infime partie de leurs propositions seraient traduites en droit.\n\nL’un des aspects les plus marquants de ce projet de loi est la création du délit d’écocide, visant à punir de 10 ans de prison et 4,5 millions d’euros d’amende tout « comportement intentionnel ayant conduit à des atteintes graves et durables à l’environnement ».  Ce qualificatif d’« écocide »  interroge.  La nature,  n'étant ni une personne physique ni morale, ne peut se constituer partie civile selon le droit français.  Loin d'être une communauté d'intérêts homogène, la nature est un domaine où les intérêts divergent, même face à l'impact de l'homme.  Certaines plantes prospèrent sur les sols incendiés, certaines algues prolifèrent grâce à des pollutions aquatiques pourtant catastrophiques pour la faune. Le malheur des uns fait le bonheur des autres.\n\nDoit-on alors condamner l’assèchement des zones humides au XIXe siècle pour lutter contre le paludisme,  malgré la destruction d’espèces animales et végétales qui en a résulté ?  L’être humain faisant partie intégrante de la nature,  faudrait-il qualifier d’écocide les avortements et les euthanasies ?  Ces questions éthiques et juridiques démontrent la complexité du terme « écocide ».\n\nBien sûr, la protection d’un environnement sain est essentielle au bien-être humain.  Cependant, cette protection ne doit pas occulter la dignité supérieure de l’homme, ni les dérives anthropologiques qui menacent sa nature même, sujet pourtant ignoré par les défenseurs du projet de loi.\n\nLa majorité présente l’écocide comme une avancée majeure,  oubliant l’arsenal juridique existant pour garantir l’intégrité de l’environnement, condition sine qua non au bien-être de l’Homme.  Le Conseil d’État a pointé l’incohérence des peines et la probable inconstitutionnalité de la mesure.  Qu’importe pour Barbara Pompili, qui parie sur la « novation juridique »,  alors même qu’elle est accusée d’écocide par Stéphane Bern pour sa politique éolienne – ironie du sort.

However, this doesn't mean the computer understands our emotions. It only recognizes the physical configuration of facial muscles.\n\nTherefore, using this technology in a classroom is problematic.

{"text": "Self-driving cars are often touted as the future of transportation, with many believing they will soon become the norm. However, I argue that autonomous vehicles are destined to fail for several key reasons, ranging from the impracticality of implementation to significant safety concerns and the simple fact that many people genuinely enjoy driving.\n\nFor many, driving is not a chore but a cherished pastime, a stress-relieving activity, and a source of personal freedom.  Self-driving cars would eliminate the simple pleasure of a leisurely drive, the thrill of a spontaneous road trip, and the immersive experience of controlling a vehicle.  Autonomous vehicles, presumably reliant on GPS, would require pre-planned destinations, stripping away the spontaneity that defines many driving experiences. Replacing this with a motionless passenger experience is unlikely to appeal to a significant portion of the population.\n\nFurthermore, the financial and logistical challenges of adapting our current infrastructure for autonomous vehicles are staggering.  Our roads are designed for human drivers. A sudden shift to self-driving cars would necessitate a massive overhaul of the entire highway system. The costs associated with installing motion sensors, GPS monitoring systems, and replacing existing public transportation with autonomous taxi services would be astronomical, placing an unreasonable burden on taxpayers.\n\nSafety is another paramount concern.  While human error contributes to accidents, entrusting driving to computers introduces a whole new set of risks.  Software glitches, hacking vulnerabilities, and unforeseen technical malfunctions could lead to catastrophic consequences, potentially causing widespread accidents and traffic chaos. The inherent unpredictability of these issues makes autonomous vehicles a far greater threat than human drivers.\n\nIn conclusion, the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles is simply not feasible.  The exorbitant cost of infrastructure modifications, the inherent safety risks, and the disregard for the enjoyment many find in driving all point to the failure of this technology. For those who value the freedom and experience of driving, sticking with a traditional vehicle remains the best option."}

Sipping a pink fruit smoothie, clad in wool socks, Cardiff sat on the floor of the small stage in the Commons corner lounge, guitar in hand. \"Everybody here has something to share,\" he announced to the dozen participants gathered before him.\n\nCardiff, a seasoned performer at the college, often incorporates workshops before his concerts.  \"Why not get the chance to connect with people?\" he explained, highlighting his belief in the power of community involvement.  He routinely conducts these sessions in schools.\n\nThe students, eager to learn from the experienced musician, embraced the opportunity. \"I really wanted to do something new,\" shared Anastasia Young, a first-year travel and tourism student, in an interview with the Times. Although not a musician herself, Young recognized the value of refining one's craft. \"We’re always trying to make ourselves better in every area of our lives,\" she observed. \"So why not in writing, or in our craft?\"  She emphasized the benefit of feedback, believing that the perspectives of others can lead to \"opportunities for growth\" and collaborative projects. For Young, the presence of others in the creative process is a necessity, not a luxury.\n\nThe workshop involved small groups writing songs within a time limit set by Cardiff, culminating in performances for their peers. Among the participants were Jake Devine and Felix Ducharme, both first-year introduction to music industry arts students.  Devine, self-described as \"pretty stubborn,\" admitted he had never co-written a song before but was open to the experience.  His motivation was clear: \"I wanted to see someone else’s perspective on how they write songs.”  Similarly, Ducharme acknowledged his solitary writing habits but reconsidered after the workshop.  \"I don’t write with people, but I think maybe I should start,\" he reflected. \"Different perspectives aren’t so bad.\"\n\nCardiff expressed his hope that the workshop would foster connections beyond the session. \"We spend all our time alone then wonder why we get stuck,\" he pointed out, underscoring the advantages of collaborative songwriting.\n\nFollowing the workshop, Cardiff treated the intimate audience to a performance, his smooth voice and rhythmic fingerpicking echoing through the candlelit room.  He shared the story behind his song \"Boy Inside the Boat,\" explaining that it was inspired by the negativity he witnessed in the world—deaths, terror attacks, and more.  \"There’s always a surplus of bad things if we look for them,\" he remarked."}

{"text": "The idea of driverless cars in today's world presents both exciting possibilities and serious concerns. While the prospect of autonomous vehicles appeals to many, perhaps due to increasing convenience or simply the novelty of the technology, we must carefully consider the potential benefits and drawbacks before fully embracing this future.\n\nOne major advantage often cited is the potential for increased safety.  Proponents argue that removing human error from the equation could drastically reduce accidents.  However, this assumes flawless technology, which is unlikely in the early stages of development.  As seen with systems like BMW's \"Traffic Jam Assistant,\" introduced in 2013, even partially autonomous features still require driver oversight and engagement.  The driver must remain alert and ready to intervene, negating some of the theoretical safety benefits.  If a driver is required to maintain focus, the question arises: what is the true purpose of a driverless car if it still needs a driver?  As Dr. Werner Huber suggests, perhaps we need to rethink the concept of \"driving fun\" in the context of autonomous vehicles.\n\nMy concern is that fully autonomous vehicles could lead to complacency and decreased vigilance.  Drivers, freed from the task of driving, might be tempted to sleep, use their phones, or engage in other distracting activities, becoming less prepared to react in emergencies."}
{"text": "Deep neural networks have proven incredibly powerful across a wide range of machine learning tasks. However, they are highly sensitive to small input perturbations, which can dramatically reduce their accuracy (Carlini & Wagner, 2017; Szegedy et al., 2013). In natural language processing (NLP), these adversarial examples often take the form of spelling mistakes, synonyms, or other meaning-preserving transformations that alter the network's prediction (Ebrahimi et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019a; Michel et al., 2019).\n\nThis paper addresses the problem of training robust models over natural language—or more generally, sequences over a finite alphabet—that are resilient to adversarial examples.  The discrete nature of the adversarial space for sequences makes it difficult to explore efficiently using gradient-based optimization techniques common in computer vision.  A common approach to achieving robustness is adversarial training (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Madry et al., 2018), which has been extensively researched in computer vision and, more recently, in NLP (Ebrahimi et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019a; Michel et al., 2019).  Given a perturbation space R(x) for a sample x—for example, if x is a sentence, R(x) might contain all possible misspellings up to a certain limit—adversarial training incorporates an adversary into the training objective. Instead of computing the loss for a sample (x, y), it computes the loss for the worst-case perturbed sample z ∈ R(x). Formally, the adversarial loss for (x, y) is max z∈R(x) L(z, y, θ).\n\nThe central question of this paper is: Can we train models robust against rich perturbation spaces over strings?\n\nThe practical challenge lies in computing this worst-case loss. The perturbation space R(x) can be enormous, making exhaustive enumeration impractical, especially in NLP tasks where R(x) should contain semantically equivalent inputs, such as variations of x with typos or synonyms.  Therefore, we need to approximate the adversarial loss.  Two classes of approximation techniques exist:\n\n* **Augmentation:** This class computes a lower bound on the adversarial loss by exploring a finite subset of R(x). This is typically done using gradient-based attacks like Hot-Flip (Ebrahimi et al., 2018) for NLP or Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) (Madry et al., 2018) for computer vision.  These techniques effectively augment the training set with perturbed samples.\n\n* **Abstraction:** This class computes an upper bound on the adversarial loss by overapproximating, or abstracting, the perturbation space R(x) into a set of symbolic constraints that can be efficiently propagated through the network.  Interval abstraction, for instance, has been used in several works (Mirman et al., 2018; Gowal et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2019).\n\nBoth techniques can be suboptimal: augmentation may severely underapproximate the worst-case loss, while abstraction may severely overapproximate it.  Furthermore, they exhibit complementary utility, performing well on some perturbation spaces but not others. For example, Huang et al. (2019) showed that abstraction works better for token substitutions, while augmentation-based techniques like Hot-Flip (Ebrahimi et al., 2018) and MHA (Zhang et al., 2019a) are more general, applying to token deletions and insertions as well."}
{"text": "Venus, sometimes called the \"Evening Star,\" is one of the brightest objects in the night sky, easily spotted even by amateur stargazers.  However, this nickname is misleading, as Venus is a planet, not a star.  Often referred to as Earth's \"twin\" due to its similar size and density, Venus is occasionally the closest planet to Earth in terms of distance, too.  Because of this relative proximity, humans have sent numerous unmanned spacecraft to this cloud-draped world.  Each mission has been unmanned for good reason: no spacecraft has survived the landing for more than a few hours.  On Venus's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than Earth's.  Interestingly, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even hotter than Mercury, despite being farther from the sun.\n\nLong ago, Venus may have been largely covered by oceans and could have supported various life forms, much like Earth. However, studying Venus from orbit provides limited insight into ground conditions.  The dense atmosphere prevents most light from penetrating, rendering standard photography and videography ineffective.  Researchers are working on innovations to allow their probes to survive long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.  NASA, for example, is exploring approaches like simplified silicon carbide electronics, which have survived for three weeks in a chamber simulating Venus's harsh surface conditions."}

{"text": "This paper investigates tensors of minimal border rank, motivated by algebraic complexity theory and the study of secant varieties.  We aim to overcome complexity lower bound barriers identified in [22, 26] and provide new \"minimal cost\" tensors for Strassen's laser method, which are not subject to the barriers described in [2] and [10]. These new tensors are not binding, circumventing the limitations established in [10] for minimal border rank binding tensors.\n\nA tensor T ∈ C<sup>m</sup> ⊗ C<sup>m</sup> ⊗ C<sup>m</sup> = A ⊗ B ⊗ C has rank one if T = a ⊗ b ⊗ c for nonzero a ∈ A, b ∈ B, c ∈ C. The rank R(T) is the smallest r such that T is a sum of r rank one tensors. The border rank R(T) is the smallest r such that T is a limit of a sum of r rank one tensors, or geometrically, the smallest r such that T ∈ σ<sup>r</sup>(Seg(P<sup>m-1</sup> × P<sup>m-1</sup> × P<sup>m-1</sup>)) ⊆ P(C<sup>m</sup> ⊗ C<sup>m</sup> ⊗ C<sup>m</sup>).\n\nA concise tensor (formally defined in §1.1) cannot be expressed in a smaller ambient space.  A concise T ∈ C<sup>m</sup> ⊗ C<sup>m</sup> ⊗ C<sup>m</sup> has border rank at least m. If the border rank equals m, T has minimal border rank."}
{"text": "Self-supervised pre-training, leveraging large-scale unlabeled data, has revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) (Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Conneau et al., 2020; Jiao et al., 2020a).  However, its adoption in Machine Translation (MT) has been limited. This is likely due to the architectural mismatch between pre-training models (e.g., Transformer encoder) and Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models (e.g., Transformer encoder-decoder).\n\nTo address this gap, sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) pre-training models like MASS (Song et al., 2019) and BART (Zhu et al., 2019; Lewis et al., 2020) have been proposed.  mBART (Liu et al., 2020) further extends BART by training on massive multilingual data, significantly improving translation performance.  While previous approaches often focused on pre-training only the encoder (Lample and Conneau, 2019), mBART pre-trains a complete autoregressive Seq2Seq model by reconstructing masked input sentences. This raises a crucial question: what is the specific contribution of the jointly pre-trained decoder?\n\nThis work provides a deeper understanding of state-of-the-art Seq2Seq pre-training, focusing on the role of the jointly pre-trained decoder.  Through experiments on various WMT and IWSLT benchmarks across different language pairs and data scales using mBART-25 (Liu et al., 2020), we analyze the decoder's impact. Our findings (§ 2.2) reveal that jointly pre-training the decoder:\n\n* Produces more diverse translations with varied word orders, necessitating multiple references for accurate evaluation on large datasets.\n* Consistently reduces adequacy-related translation errors compared to pre-training the encoder alone.\n\nDespite the performance benefits, we also identify side effects stemming from discrepancies between pre-training and fine-tuning (§2.3):\n\n* **Domain Discrepancy:** Seq2Seq models are often pre-trained on general domain data (e.g., arXiv), while downstream tasks focus on specific domains (e.g., news). This necessitates further adaptation during fine-tuning.\n* **Objective Discrepancy:** NMT models learn to translate between languages, while Seq2Seq pre-training focuses on input reconstruction. This leads to over-estimation and hallucination with noisy input, exacerbating the beam search degradation problem already associated with Seq2Seq pre-training (Liu et al., 2021).\n\nTo mitigate these issues, we introduce two strategies (§3): in-domain pre-training and input adaptation during fine-tuning.  In-domain pre-training bridges the domain gap by continuing mBART pre-training on in-domain monolingual data. Input adaptation involves adding noise to the source sentences during fine-tuning, facilitating knowledge transfer from the pre-trained model.\n\nOur experiments demonstrate that in-domain pre-training significantly improves translation performance, while input adaptation enhances robustness. Combining both yields a high-performing NMT system.  Further analysis shows that our approach reduces domain discrepancy, particularly for low-frequency words, and alleviates over-estimation and beam search degradation.\n\n\n* Work was mainly done when Wenxuan Wang and Yongchang Hao were interning at Tencent AI Lab.\n† Zhaopeng Tu is the corresponding author.\narXiv:2203.08442v1 [cs.CL] 16 Mar 2022  (This information is typically placed as a footnote or at the beginning/end of the paper, not within the main body.)"}

This is Korins' fourth novel for young readers and the second installment in his Sammy Baker time travel series.\n\n“I grew up in Dorchester from age 11 to 16, and Ted Williams was my idol,” Korins shared. “Seeing him at Fenway Park was a rare and thrilling occasion.”\n\nIn this stand-alone sequel, 12-year-old Sammy once again utilizes the magic typewriter from Korins' first novel. This time, instead of traveling to the Great Depression, Sammy finds himself transported to 1960, landing right in the Red Sox dugout beside “Teddy Ballgame.”  Williams becomes Sammy’s mentor, offering life and batting advice. While Sammy relishes his time with his newfound hero, he also yearns for home and must complete a mission before returning.\n\n“There is a puppy love interest,” Korins teased, adding that the story offers something for everyone, even those who aren't baseball enthusiasts.  During his time travel adventure, Sammy takes on the persona of his uncle, Terry, and even finds a bit of romance.\n\nDorchester itself plays a significant role in the book.  “Readers will recognize landmarks,” Korins noted.\n\nKorins, who has dreamt of being a writer since he was 11, draws inspiration from his own childhood experiences. “You have to be a reader to be a writer,” he emphasized. “I always had a book in my hand.”  Saturday mornings were spent at the local toy store, adding the latest Hardy Boys Mystery to his collection.  Just like his character Sammy, Korins played Little League.\n\n“I had a great childhood,” he reminisced. “The character is a composite of the kids I knew, the kids I grew up with.” He remains connected with many of these childhood friends, who continue to inspire his writing. “I wrote for that age group because I enjoyed that age. There is part of me in every book.”\n\n\nThough his reading list now includes authors like Richard Russo and Colum McAnn, Korins offers advice for aspiring writers, particularly those interested in writing for young readers. \"Don’t write down,\" he cautioned."}

{"text": "The rusted city gates groaned closed, the sound swallowed by the roar of our engines. Outpost guards pointed, wagering on our chances.  We were dropping loot packs, desperate to pick up speed. Tony, in the lead, hurled a duffle bag overflowing with books.  The gate was feet from sealing us out for the night. We surged forward. Tony lunged, his foot catching on a stray reinforcement pole. A sickening crunch, then an agonizing scream that made even the jaded guards flinch.\n\nWe froze, staring at the mangled mess of garage door, pipes, barbed wire, and stop signs. Tony's foot, still trapped, hung grotesquely. We heard the medic sprinting, amputation kit undoubtedly in hand. Tony, I realized with a chilling jolt, was the lucky one. I’d trade both arms to be inside the safety of the camp.  I turned to my group. Amy hid tears under her hood. Zip pounded the ground, cursing. Dave, as always, stood silent, seemingly daring the encroaching darkness to challenge him.\n\nThe sprawling clouds swallowed the mountain peak, a grim omen.  We all knew the guards' methods.\n\n“We have to go back down,” I said.\n\n“Fuck you,” Zip spat.\n\nAmy’s voice was thick with sobs. “You know what will happen.”\n\n“We can take it,” I insisted, gesturing to Amy’s rifle and Zip’s AR.  “We have weapons for a reason.”\n\n“He’s right,” Dave said quietly, his voice a low rumble.\n\n“Fine…” Zip conceded.  “But you lead.”\n\n“Let’s go,” I said, and we descended into the swirling ocean of clouds.\n\nThe descent was shrouded in deepening gloom, our morale plummeting with every foot. Dave, of course, remained stoic. We reached the infamous “Shit Show,” a sprawling bandit market where everything was for sale and no one was safe. Kidnappings, drug deals, and shootouts were the norm in this shantytown.  We navigated the chaotic streets, avoiding eye contact, our ragged clothes and visible weapons providing a veneer of belonging.\n\nI approached a weapons merchant, knowing we needed more firepower to reach the next town.\n\n“Watcha need, hot shot?” the old man rasped, gesturing to his arsenal.\n\nI pointed to a wicked-looking sawed-off shotgun, two of its four barrels rusted and crudely bolted on.\n\n“It’ll turn anything into a nice red slush,” he grinned, laying it on the counter. “Anything else?”\n\nAmy stepped forward, rummaging through a bucket of ammo. She selected ten bullets, each marked with a different colored skull.\n\n“Each color’s a different effect,” the merchant explained, dragging on a cigarette. “I won’t bore ya with the details, but the darker the color, the deader your target’s gonna be.”\n\nDave’s voice was cold. “The bunker buster grenade. Two of them.”\n\nThe merchant’s eyes gleamed. “Well, this’ll be one helluva payday for me. How ya wanna pay?”\n\nI hefted the duffle bag of books onto the counter. The merchant’s cigarette tumbled to the steel, his apprentice taking a hasty step back.\n\n“How…?” he stammered, staring at us.\n\n“We’re scrappers,” I said. “Found a school a few miles out. Are you taking them or not?”\n\n“Ye-yeah, yeah,” he said, snatching the bag and glancing nervously around. “And come back if you get any more.”\n\nWe grabbed our new gear and headed towards the next city. That’s when they attacked.\n\nAn armored car slammed into the makeshift booze fountain in the center of the market, a mounted LMG spitting fire."}

El vicepresidente de Anfac (Asociación Nacional de Fabricantes de Automóviles y Camiones), Mario Armero, calcula que este contexto \"provocará una reducción de las ventas de unos 45.000 vehículos con respecto a las expectativas iniciales para 2019\".\n\nArmero considera que no existe un contexto económico negativo que explique la caída de las matriculaciones. La actividad económica del país sigue mejorando —incluso las revisiones de estimación de algunos organismos internacionales lo confirman— y el desempleo disminuye. \"A pesar de ello, hay gente que está retrasando la compra y, al mismo tiempo, tiene dudas sobre qué vehículo adquirir\", afirmó este viernes durante la presentación de la Memoria Anual de la patronal. El vicepresidente de Anfac señala varios factores clave para entender estas decisiones: las críticas a los vehículos de combustión, especialmente los diésel; las medidas de restricción de algunos municipios, como Madrid, sin un plan estatal que las coordine; y la falta de ayudas públicas. De hecho, Anfac estima que el mercado cerrará este año con una caída del 3% en las ventas de coches. En 2018 se comercializaron 1.321.438 vehículos, tras un aumento del 7%. \"Me gustaría que este pronóstico no se cumpliera\", afirmó Armero, quien considera que el descenso \"se puede moderar\" en la segunda mitad del año si se implementara alguna campaña de ayudas."}

Le résultat, opposant Donald Trump à Joe Biden,  aura des conséquences pour la Formule 1 et ses intérêts dans le pays, notamment ses courses à Austin et son projet d'implantation à Miami.\n\nLa Formule 1 est un sport à forte empreinte carbone, malgré des efforts de réduction et un objectif de neutralité carbone pour 2030.  La position des candidats sur l'environnement diverge fortement. Biden promet une transition énergétique, l'élimination des subventions aux carburants et une meilleure efficacité énergétique, ce qui pourrait poser des défis à la F1.  À l'inverse, Trump, amateur de voitures sportives, ne considère pas l'environnement comme une priorité.  \n\nLa gestion de la pandémie aura également un impact.  Biden privilégierait une approche plus stricte avec port du masque obligatoire et priorité à la santé, tandis que Trump minimise l'importance du masque et privilégie l'économie. L'évolution de la pandémie, influencée par ces mesures, déterminera le retour de la F1 en Amérique.\n\nL'influence du résultat électoral se fera sentir aussi au niveau local. Le maire d'Austin (où se déroule le Grand Prix des États-Unis) est démocrate, tandis que le maire du comté de Miami-Dade soutient le projet de Grand Prix et est républicain.

They fill their feeds with barely-there workout clothes, sponsored drinks, and endless selfies. Nick was hooked. He'd crane his neck at the gym, hoping to spot someone even remotely similar.  Sometimes we did, but they never measured up.  I'd point out a beautiful woman, and he'd flex in the mirror, saying, \"Dude, she's not as hot as Demi Rose.

{"text": "The year was 1980-something. David Draiman, a young boy from Brooklyn, enjoyed the typical pursuits of his era – perhaps Slinkys, penny boards, or those short shorts. One night, his life took a dramatic turn. He was abducted, not by earthly beings, but by the gods of rock.  While he’d dabbled in music, listening to the Beatles and other popular artists, it was merely a pastime. This night changed everything.\n\nFollowing his otherworldly encounter, David moved from city to city, his focus shifting from observant Jewish tradition to the heavy riffs of rock and roll. He rebelled against conformity, seeking his own definition of \"normal.\"  He formed bands in various cities, including Los Angeles and Milwaukee, prioritizing his newfound religion of rock over everything else, much to the chagrin of his parents.  But David was driven by a force beyond their understanding, a mission bestowed upon him by the rock gods.  As the 80s faded, so did his childhood idols. A new era dawned – the age of heavy metal.  The first time David heard Metallica, the sheer power and beauty of the music sent shivers down his spine. The symphony of vocals, guitar, bass, and drums captivated him completely.\n\nThe following decade saw the rise of bands like Nirvana, Sublime, and Red Hot Chili Peppers, further fueling David’s passion.  In 1996, fate intervened. A struggling band called Disturbed parted ways with their lead singer, and David answered the call.  He was nearing the summit of Rock Olympus, and the gods, who had patiently watched his ascent, bestowed upon him their final gift.\n\nA strange ailment began to plague David.  He felt an unknown force building within him, an energy he couldn’t control.  It worsened with each passing day, defying any medical explanation.  Music, his usual solace, offered no comfort.  Melodies became distorted, chords refused to resolve. Only a few specific patterns resonated, hinting at a deeper meaning. David realized this was a test from the rock gods.  After months of struggle, the pressure became unbearable.  \"After constant struggle, months of battling it, he could no longer contain it. It was itching to break out, to explode into the world.\""}

The media, the President, dignitaries I'd never know, all were there to witness it. A rope ladder, not even wood, descended from a port in the cinderblock’s side. \"Goddamn it,\" my father laughed, stuffing crackers into his mouth, \"they can't even build a ladder out of *wood*, why in the Hell is anyone afraid of these guys?\"  But I was rapt.\n\nA plume of smoke obscured the figures emerging from the ship. A *clank* echoed as the first touched Earth – a momentous occasion, we'd learn later.  Four figures walked through the dissipating smoke.  The reporter muttered a disbelieving, \"*well fuck me*,\" before announcing the obvious: \"Human! The visitors appear to be human!\"\n\nClinking and clanking, they approached the assembled dignitaries.  Their expressions were of tearful reminiscence, echoing memories passed down through stories, paintings, and legends. One paused, touching a purple flower with the tenderness of a first love. The others waited patiently before joining him for the final steps.  Hands were outstretched, and the visitors clasped arms, nodding and speaking in elegant, unintelligible phrases.\n\nSuddenly, a man in the back, the Italian Prime Minister as we later learned, pushed his way through the presidents and premiers of the world’s superpowers.  He shouted, interrupting the visitors, grasped a hand, shook it vigorously, and spoke rapidly. The visitors turned, bemused.\n\nThat’s when I noticed their outfits. The metallic shoulder plates, the jangling mail skirts, the helmets protecting their noses, the crests… I *knew* them.  They were different, the colors altered, the metal a dull, dark hue, the crests unfamiliar, but I *knew*.\n\nThe reporter yelled at the Prime Minister, a spectacle unfolding, his career likely over.  Then the Prime Minister laughed, a boisterous sound.  \"The fuck is wrong with this guy?\" my father muttered, \"like the cat that ate the canary…\"\n\nThe visitors laughed too. It was Greek, a language the Prime Minister, unlike the rest of the assembled dignitaries, understood.  The visitors, it turned out, were descendants of ancient Greeks, saved from barbarians by Diana, goddess of the moon, and cast into space. Now they had returned to reclaim what they had lost. Some Earth leaders invoked *our* gods.\n\nThe lead centurion whistled. Another figure scurried from the ship, catching a thrown object. He ran towards the procession. Shouts arose: \"It's a spear! It's… is that blood?\"  He hurled the spear.  It landed at the feet of the visitors. The centurion spoke one word that needed no translation: *War*.\n\nThey never made it back to their ship.  They drew their swords, attempting to kill the Prime Minister, and were gunned down. Hundreds more poured from the ship, fighting to the death.  My father laughed. \"They think that can kill us? All this giant ships and moon-talk and shit, and they try to stab us?\"  The world echoed his derision.\n\nThen, at nine the next morning, it went dark.  Unbelievably, impossibly dark.  We brushed it off at first. A day or two, what’s the harm?  But the darkness persisted. Days bled into weeks, then months, then years.  They began confiscating our satellites, casting them adrift. Even the ISS was flung away.  But there was no other aggression, only… darkness.

{"text": "东北大学(Northeastern University)近日发布的“A Drop in the Bucket”研究报告揭示了一个令人担忧的趋势：美国家庭维持基本供水的费用正在急剧上涨。自2010年以来，每单位水费已飙升50%，增速远超家庭收入增长。报告预测，到2022年，将有36%的美国家庭无力支付水费。\n\n这项研究深入分析了麻州12个社区的水费情况，发现水费上涨已成为普遍现象。例如，Winthrop镇今年早些时候水费上涨了35%，Pittsfield镇的下水道费在2019年1月上涨了50%，水费也将在今年年底上涨20%。即使在波士顿，尽管今年水费和下水道费仅上涨了2.85%，但预计从2020年至2023年，每年都将上涨3.65%。事实上，根据2014年麻州全球行动(Massachusetts Global Action)的报告，波士顿每年都有数千居民面临断水风险。\n\n报告指出，水费上涨的原因包括老旧基础设施的维修和升级，以及气候变化导致的暴雨和洪水增加管理成本。报告作者戴维斯(Martha F. Davis)在WBUR的专栏文章中强调，水费上涨对低收入居民的影响不容忽视，呼吁地方政府采取措施提供补助。他指出，美国家庭平均每天的用水量大致相同（80至100加仑），但各家庭的承受能力却大相径庭。\n\n研究调查显示，水费上涨给部分居民带来了沉重的经济负担。在切尔西市，去年水费上涨了8%，一位居民表示为了支付水费，不得不减少处方药的开支；另一位居民甚至因为水费太贵而放弃了自家的菜园。\n\n报告批评现有的水费优惠政策不足以解决问题。虽然麻州大多数城镇会为低收入老年人提供水费折扣，但这仅惠及一小部分人群。此外，12个被调查的麻州社区都没有根据居民收入制定可负担性计划，仅有3个城镇提供优惠项目。而且，这些社区都没有实施分级收费或租客优惠政策。优惠政策的制定也缺乏透明度，资格认定通常由前线管理者决定，用户难以了解政策制定的渠道。报告强调，用水是一项基本人权，麻州州法也将水认定为公共资源，因此水费问题关乎人权。\n\n报告还指出，现有的房产相关的优惠政策对拥房比例较低的少数族裔家庭不利。戴维斯强调，麻州是全国收入差距第八大的州，水费上涨对低收入家庭的影响更是不容小觑。"}

{"text": "This \"Innovative Practice\" paper examines Reusable Learning Objects (RLOs), exploring their effectiveness based on current literature and practice, highlighting successful strategies and areas for improvement.  We begin by defining Learning Objects and reviewing relevant literature. Then, we analyze the RLO life-cycle, encompassing authoring, revising, producing, delivering, and ultimately, reusing.  This analysis informs the introduction of key factors and features designed to enhance sharing and reuse effectiveness.  Finally, we present the CourseGen framework and tool-set, which focuses on creating detailed, flexible, and reusable learning objects. This tool-set comprises open-source software and a substantial collection of open-source learning objects for Software Engineering and Entrepreneurship courses.\n\nWhat are Reusable Learning Objects (RLOs)?  While Noguera et al. [1] define Learning Objects as \"reusable entities either digital or otherwise used to support learning,\" this definition, while intuitive, is somewhat circular.  The term originated in the 1990s and has appeared in the literature with various similar definitions. We can better understand RLOs by breaking down the term:\n\n* **Reusable:** This implies that a learning object created for one purpose can be repurposed in different contexts by different users.  This requires a flexible and appropriate level of granularity, modularity, and composability, as well as a non-proprietary data format and appropriate originator permissions, each of which will be discussed further.\n* **Learning:**  While intuitively connected to learning, teaching, or education, the scope of \"learning\" could be broadened.  Reuse opportunities exist beyond strict learning contexts, such as grading policies or teacher-student agreements.\n* **Object:** Likely originating from Object-Oriented Programming, \"object\" in the RLO context signifies a small, reusable unit with an abstracted internal structure."}
{"text": "## Reestructuración del texto sobre el caso Odebrecht\n\nEl principal imputado en el caso Odebrecht, Ángel Rondón, presentó este jueves a nueve de sus diez testigos a descargo ante el Primer Tribunal Colegiado del Distrito Nacional.  De estos, solamente tres reconocieron conocer a Rondón, acusado de soborno.\n\nEl abogado de Rondón, José Miguel Minier, argumentó que la acusación sostiene que su cliente dirigía el comité de licitación mediante sobornos para adjudicarse 17 obras de Odebrecht.  Minier señaló que dicho comité estaba compuesto por cinco personas, tres de las cuales declararon en el tribunal.  Según el abogado, ninguno de estos exsenadores conocía a Rondón ni recordaba cómo funcionaba el Senado en aquel momento, lo que demostraría, según su teoría, que Rondón nunca participó en el comité.  Además, aseguró que se demostró la transparencia e institucionalidad en la elaboración de los pliegos de condiciones para las licitaciones, tanto nacionales como internacionales.\n\nLos representantes del Ministerio Público y la Procuraduría Especializada de Persecución de la Corrupción Administrativa (PEPCA) calificaron la presentación de los testigos como \"ficticia y una pérdida de tiempo\".  Wilson Camacho, titular del PEPCA, declaró: “Lo que hemos escuchado es que esos testigos ni siquiera saben las obras que construyó Odebrecht.  No recuerdan cómo funcionaba el Senado\".\n\nEntre los testigos que asistieron se encontraban Pedro Delgado Malagón, Luis José Placeres Peña, Frank Matos, Edgar Adolfo Victoria Yeb, y los exsenadores Vicente Castillo, Amílcar Romero y Francis Vargas. Fausto de Jesús López Solís presentó excusa y la defensa desistió de su testimonio.\n\nDelgado Malagón, presidente de la empresa Tecnoamérica, recordó solo cuatro adendas para la construcción de la autovía El Coral, un proyecto de Odebrecht en asociación con Diego de Moya Canaán, inaugurado en mayo del 2012. Bolívar Bello Belliard, exviceministro de Obras Públicas, negó cualquier relación con Rondón y afirmó que todas las licitaciones se realizaron conforme a la ley.  Frank Matos, miembro de la Comisión de licitación de Obras Públicas,  se mostró olvidadizo y solo recordó dos obras de Odebrecht. Victoria Yeb también negó vínculos con Rondón.\n\nDe los exsenadores, Vicente Castillo (Peravia) admitió conocer a Rondón.

My patients occasionally leave behind a finger, a foot, or even half their skin, torn from their bones after colliding with a table. Many of my former patients would have been appalled, but we live in different times. Different times, different measures, as the saying goes. The apocalypse changes everything.\n\nWhen the dead started rising, I was barely scraping by as an assistant to the professor.  \"The Freud of the 23rd century,\" they called the old fool.  If you ask me, he was a buffoon, his authority derived solely from his title, his meaningful research having ceased years ago.\n\n\"I'm not the only one?\" he abruptly raised his head, as if my words had finally penetrated his decaying brain.\n\n\"Of course not,\" I soothed, acutely aware of the need to manage his volatile temper.\n\n\"But why am I doing it? Why? I know I could accomplish so much in my afterlife.\" He shook his head violently, his right earlobe nearly landing on my suit.\n\n\"Many of my patients experience the same guilt. Like you, they know killing humans is wrong.\"  Something in my voice must have betrayed me, because his slimy, yellow eyes narrowed skeptically.  The truth was, I didn't agree with the sentiment. It had been a pleasure watching one of his zombie friends rip that 23rd-century Freud apart.  The other assistants had fled in terror. I, however, was delighted as Jack—I think his name was Jack—tore off the professor's left arm and finally snapped his neck. It sounded like breaking a chocolate bar.  I watched with satisfaction as Jack sucked the blood from the professor's head, weeping tears of blackish blood. Then he saw me. We were alone in the university's fifth-floor hallway. Jack advanced. With a distinct sense of displeasure, I envisioned myself meeting the same fate."}

{"text": "The study of limit cycles in nonlinear differential systems, particularly their bifurcation from equilibria, has been a long-standing challenge since Poincaré's introduction of the concept in the late 19th century [45].  A key problem, known as the second part of Hilbert's 16th problem [23], focuses on determining the number and position of limit cycles for planar polynomial systems, a question that remains open.  This challenge has spurred extensive research, including significant contributions to the qualitative theory of differential equations by figures like Lyapunov [41], Bendixson [6], Andronov [1], and Arnold [2].\n\nHistorically, determining the number of limit cycles has yielded surprising results.  For example, Petrovsky and Landis [43] attempted to prove a maximum of 3 limit cycles for planar quadratic systems, only to be contradicted by Chen and Wang [12] and Shi [51] who independently discovered examples with 4.  Such unexpected findings fueled further interest in quadratic and cubic systems, leading to results like Li et al.'s proof [32] of at least 13 limit cycles in planar cubic systems, the current best known lower bound. These and other results have not only enriched the qualitative theory of differential equations but also found important applications in science and engineering.\n\nThis paper focuses on complete zero-Hopf bifurcations, where limit cycles emerge from zero-Hopf equilibria in higher-dimensional systems."}

{"text": "Blockchain technology offers significant advantages, driving the need for specialized software engineering practices and modeling techniques tailored to this new computing paradigm [1].  Models are crucial for developing effective methodologies and reference architectures [2], enabling model-driven engineering (MDE) [3]. They simplify complex systems by focusing on key software development goals, facilitating early feedback on correctness, and abstracting away irrelevant details. Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) further enhance the modeling process by providing intuitive syntax for domain experts, specialized primitives [4], and even code generation capabilities for specific domains.  Complementary models can offer valuable insights into complex phenomena.\n\nThe Unified Modeling Language (UML), a standardized graphical language for modeling software-intensive systems [5], offers partial executability [6] and extensibility through profiles [7][8].  UML profiles provide a lightweight extension mechanism, introducing domain or platform-specific elements, connectors, and diagrams [7]. While various UML diagrams offer complementary perspectives on different software system aspects, profiles tailor UML to specific domains.\n\nExisting research on blockchain modeling, while valuable, often focuses on modeling specific instances rather than developing reusable meta-models.  For example, Rocha and Ducasse [9] modeled smart contracts using UML class diagrams, but without fully leveraging UML's extensibility mechanisms like stereotypes and tagged values. Bollen [10] employed fact-based modeling for Hyperledger Fabric, but the resulting models can be complex to interpret.  Studies on blockchain service integration and orchestration [11][12] have also employed modeling techniques like i* and UML use case and sequence diagrams [12], often focusing on requirements and contract interactions rather than detailed design. To the best of our knowledge, no tool-supported, Bitcoin-specific meta-model currently exists. This study addresses this gap by proposing the first such meta-model designed to support application development through profiling.\n\nBuilding on existing research and leveraging UML, OCL, and Bitcoin's ontology, we propose a novel UML profile. This profile ensures model alignment with Bitcoin's ontology and enables automated conformance evaluation.  Alignment is achieved through the definition of specific stereotypes, tagged values, and enumerations within the profile, while conformance is ensured through OCL constraints.  Our profile has been implemented within the Sparx EA modeling tool.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces foundational concepts. Section 3 details our proposed UML profile. Section 4 presents a case study demonstrating the profile's application. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the study and offers concluding remarks."}

The trio finished with a winning time of 3 hours 50 minutes, acknowledging it was the toughest race they had ever paddled, making the victory even sweeter.\n\n“The key to the race was getting a strong start and reading the river correctly,” Finbar O’Donovan told the Leinster Express. “We knew that it would spell disaster if we took the wrong route over the high drops. Luckily, we got everything right on the day.”  The less experienced competitors faced carnage on the big weirs, highlighting the skill and precision required to navigate the challenging course.\n\nCongratulations are also extended to Laois Kayak & Canoe Club members Seamus Byrne, Matt McGrath, Patrick Marshall, and Catherine Byrne, who all finished the race with commendable times.\n\n**About The Club**\n\nBased in Durrow, Laois Kayak and Canoe Club offers a variety of kayaking and canoeing activities, from white water river-running and canoe polo to freestyle play boating and flat-water racing.  The club caters to all skill levels, from beginners to experts.  Affiliated with Canoeing Ireland (ICU), the club provides training and progression following Canoeing Ireland's skills award programmes, led by ICU qualified instructors.\n\nFor more information, visit www.laoiskayak.com or find them on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/laoiskayak/  Contact: Brian Ogilvie, mob. 086 1739029, email. info@laoiskayak.com"}

{"text": "The Face on Mars: A Natural Wonder, Not an Alien Creation\n\nMany people have seen unusual shapes in random objects or landscapes, sometimes even resembling faces.  The \"Face on Mars\" is a prime example, sparking speculation about alien origins. However, scientific evidence strongly suggests that this Martian feature is a natural landform, not an extraterrestrial construction.\n\nNASA's subsequent investigations revealed the true nature of the \"Face.\"  The initial image, capturing a seemingly humanoid visage, was a trick of light and shadow.  As NASA explained, the \"face\" was a \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\"  This clarifies that the unique appearance resulted from natural processes, making it a distinctive geological feature rather than an alien artifact.\n\nFurthermore, there is no scientific evidence supporting the existence of aliens, let alone their involvement in creating this Martian formation. While some individuals claim to have encountered extraterrestrials, these accounts lack scientific validation.  The absence of credible evidence makes it impossible to confirm the existence of aliens, much less attribute the \"Face\" to their activity. NASA's research reinforces the conclusion that this feature is a natural landform.\n\nFinally, analysis of the \"Face\" reveals it to be the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, a common landform in the American West.  Geologist Jim Garvin noted its resemblance to Middle Butte in Idaho, a lava dome forming an isolated mesa similar in height to the Martian feature.  This comparison further solidifies the understanding of the \"Face\" as a significant, naturally occurring landform.\n\nWhile the possibility of extraterrestrial life remains a topic of fascination, it's important to rely on scientific evidence. In the case of the \"Face on Mars,\" the evidence clearly points to a natural origin.  The formation is a testament to the power of natural processes to create intriguing and unusual shapes, not a sign of alien intervention. While the search for extraterrestrial life continues, the \"Face on Mars\" stands as a reminder that sometimes, the simplest explanation is the most accurate."}

{"text": "Semantic segmentation of point clouds has become increasingly important.  Building upon the success of 2D image recognition (Long, Shelhamer, and Darrell 2015; Chen et al. 2017), many works have attempted to directly extend 2D convolutional networks to 3D space (Maturana and Scherer 2015; Zhou and Tuzel 2018). However, these methods are limited by a drastic increase in computational complexity.  Alternatively, PointNet (Qi et al. 2017a) utilized shared multi-layer perceptrons to directly process point clouds and aggregate information through max-pooling. However, it failed to exploit local relationships between points. Due to the uneven distribution of points and the irregularity of their representation, semantic segmentation of point clouds remains a challenging task.\n\nBoundaries play a crucial role in semantic segmentation, as many misclassifications occur near boundary points. In a point cloud, a boundary refers to the transition area between two or more objects of different categories. For example, the junction of a sofa and the floor can be considered a boundary.  Many works (Wang et al. 2018; Xu et al. 2018; Wu, Qi, and Fuxin 2019) have addressed point cloud segmentation without explicitly learning or using boundary information. Consequently, they extract features without differentiating between boundary and non-boundary points.  Critically, features extracted on boundaries are often ambiguous, as they mix features from points belonging to different categories on either side. As the network deepens, if other points incorporate these ambiguous boundary features, the ambiguity propagates hierarchically, spreading information across boundaries and leading to poor contour delineation in the final segmentation.\n\nTo address this, we propose a Boundary Prediction Module (BPM) to predict boundary points. This module provides a soft boundary prediction and is supervised by dynamically generated ground truth. Boundary prediction is simpler than semantic segmentation and likely to yield better results. Therefore, we introduce the lightweight BPM to predict boundaries and use these predictions as auxiliary information to enhance segmentation performance. The BPM and the segmentation network are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Figure 1 illustrates predicted boundaries in several scenes, demonstrating accurate localization between different categories and visually reflecting the BPM's effectiveness.\n\nBased on the BPM, we design a boundary-aware Geometric Encoding Module (GEM) to utilize the predicted boundary information during feature extraction.  When aggregating local features, we restrict information sharing within object areas, preventing feature propagation across boundaries.  Mixing local features from different categories would destroy detailed information.  In subsequent encoder layers, where representative points are sampled and global features are encoded, information from different categories can transfer across boundaries to capture global scene information.  Thus, the predicted boundary acts as a barrier, preventing unwanted mixing during local feature aggregation while allowing information flow for global context.\n\nTo effectively exploit geometric information, we also design a lightweight Geometric Convolution Operation (GCO) that complements the boundary-aware GEM. The GCO focuses on the angular distribution of neighbors rather than the spatial distribution used in KCNet (Shen et al. 2018) and KPConv (Thomas et al. 2019), which are sensitive to point density and lack generalization."}

Hundreds of millions of cases are diagnosed globally each year, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths, making colon cancer the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality.  The disease is classified into four stages, from I (early stage) to IV (advanced stage), which indicate the extent of cancer progression.\n\nA critical challenge in cancer research, and particularly in colon cancer, is accurate staging. Staging informs prognosis, life expectancy, and the likelihood of successful treatment.  Researchers are actively pursuing ways to improve prevention, early detection, and treatment of colon cancer to reduce both incidence and mortality rates, and enhance the quality of life for those affected.\n\nDeep learning offers a powerful computational framework for analyzing complex biospecimen data, enabling feature encoding, extraction, integration, and transformation of heterogeneous biological information.  While previous studies often focused on unimodal data or employed simpler linear models or earlier deep learning architectures, even for multimodal data including clinical trials, this study utilizes a bimodal fusion approach."}

This technology, known as the Facial Action Coding System, could dynamically adjust lessons, making them clearer and more engaging.  The benefits of such a system would ripple outwards, impacting not only individual students but also teachers, schools, and ultimately, the entire nation's educational landscape.\n\nStudents would be the primary beneficiaries.  Lessons tailored to their individual understanding would ensure comprehension and engagement, leading to increased attendance and a more positive attitude towards learning. This deeper engagement would naturally translate to improved grades and test scores, reducing stress and fostering a genuine appreciation for education.  Learning would become easier and more enjoyable, creating a virtuous cycle of academic success.\n\nThis success would, in turn, benefit teachers.  With students thriving, much of the pressure on teachers would dissipate.  A more positive learning environment would likely reduce stress and potentially even lead to increased recognition and compensation. Furthermore, it could alleviate the tension sometimes experienced between parents and teachers, as student success becomes a shared achievement.\n\nThe positive effects would extend to schools themselves.  A community of happy students and teachers creates a thriving school environment.  Improved academic performance would enhance the school's reputation, potentially attracting increased funding and resources. This would further empower schools to provide the best possible education for every student, maximizing their potential.\n\nUltimately, the cumulative effect of these individual improvements would elevate the overall learning and knowledge base of the nation.  A generation of engaged, successful students promises a brighter future for everyone."}

{"text": "Single-channel speech separation [1] is a fundamental acoustic signal processing task, extensively studied as a front-end module for downstream tasks like speech recognition [2] and speaker verification [3].  Often referred to as the \"cocktail party problem,\" it aims to extract individual voices from a mixture of multiple speakers.\n\nThis highly underdetermined problem has seen the development of data-driven methods using deep neural networks [4, 5, 6].  These methods perform well on reference-based metrics requiring ground truth signals, such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) [7], perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) [8], and short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) [9]. However, these metrics don't perfectly align with human perception.  Models trained on them often introduce perceptually unnatural distortions, potentially harming downstream tasks [10].\n\nRecent years have witnessed the rise of deep generative models like variational auto-encoders (VAEs) [11, 12], generative adversarial networks (GANs) [13], and diffusion models [14] for unsupervised, high-quality sample generation.  The relative stability of diffusion models has particularly attracted researchers in computer vision [15, 16]. While their application to acoustic signal processing, including speech enhancement [17, 18, 19], dereverberation [20], and separation [21, 22, 23], is still emerging,  promising results warrant further investigation.  Motivated by this, we apply a diffusion model to speech separation to improve perceived audio quality.\n\nTwo primary approaches exist for applying diffusion models to speech separation.  The first attempts simultaneous separation and generation [21, 22]. However, tasking a single model with multiple complex operations can degrade performance compared to conventional discriminative models.  The second approach refines the output of a preceding discriminative model using the diffusion model as a vocoder [23], yielding improved performance.  The stochastic regeneration model (StoRM) [18], designed for speech enhancement and dereverberation, shares a similar concept.  However, both approaches have limitations.  In [23], separation quality is refined by summing discriminative and generative outputs, with an additional alignment network predicting the weighting coefficient.  However, generation is conditioned solely on the corresponding preceding source estimate, limiting design flexibility. For example, incorporating global information from all separated sources from the discriminative model hasn't been fully explored.  In [18], the discriminative model and diffusion-based regenerator are trained end-to-end, requiring retraining the diffusion model whenever the preceding model or dataset changes.\n\nThis paper proposes a diffusion-based refiner for speech separation using the denoising diffusion restoration model (DDRM) [24].  DDRM, a conditional generative model, controls output by solving a linear inverse problem.  Because DDRM's evidence lower bound (ELBO) [25] objective can be rewritten in the same form as the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) [14]—meaning DDRM and DDPM share a common optimal solution—our method can leverage a pre-trained DDPM with any preceding speech separation model.  Furthermore, DDRM's ability to control generation by modifying the linear inverse problem formulation allows for greater flexibility.  For example, the model could be designed to regenerate only less confident regions of the preceding discriminative output, preserving the original signal in high-confidence areas."}

{"text": "## CLX Communications and Juniper Research Forecast Quadrupling of Enterprise CPaaS Spending by 2022\n\n**London and Stockholm – February 20, 2018** – CLX Communications AB (publ) (XSTO: CLX) and Juniper Research have released a new white paper forecasting that enterprise spending on Communications Platform as a Service (CPaaS) will quadruple to $6.7 billion by 2022.\n\nJuniper Research estimates the CPaaS market grew by 50% to more than $1.6 billion in 2017. While early CPaaS adoption was primarily driven by agile, disruptive, digital-first companies, the landscape is shifting.  Established businesses are recognizing the crucial role of differentiation and personalization in attracting and retaining customers, with customer engagement becoming a key competitive battleground.\n\nCPaaS is a cloud-based platform that allows businesses to seamlessly integrate communication capabilities—such as voice, video, and messaging—into their applications without building backend infrastructure and interfaces. This empowers them to effortlessly add features like chatbots, service agents, and contact center functionality to their customer-facing applications.\n\nThe white paper, \"Communications Platforms – Transforming Enterprises into Digital Innovators,\" provides an overview of the CPaaS market and its growth potential. It also charts the evolution from SaaS to PaaS and demonstrates the effectiveness of CPaaS through various use cases.\n\n\"We live in a hyper-connected world where we routinely engage with friends and family using a range of voice, video, and messaging technologies,\" commented Robert Gerstmann, Co-founder and Chief Product Officer at CLX. \"As consumers, we expect to engage with our chosen brands and businesses whenever and however we like. CPaaS enables enterprises to rapidly innovate to meet this consumer demand, making it easy to integrate a range of communication functions within existing customer-facing apps and online systems. As our white paper with Juniper illustrates, it's no longer just tech-native businesses innovating through CPaaS. Many established multinationals are now recognizing the importance of omnichannel communication for attracting and engaging the customer of tomorrow.\"\n\nDr. Windsor Holden, Head of Forecasting & Consultancy at Juniper Research, added: \"The rapid pace of technological change can be challenging even for the most agile enterprises. New technologies and devices spawn new demand patterns, making it difficult to keep pace, let alone future-proof operations. CPaaS offers a highly flexible solution that enables greater scalability while reducing implementation time.  Enterprises using CPaaS can continually evolve their customer engagement channels in line with consumer demand, which is why we predict enterprise spend on CPaaS to surge in the next four years.\"\n\nDownload the \"Communications Platforms – Transforming Enterprises into Digital Innovators\" white paper from the CLX Communications website: [https://www.clxcommunications.com/help/downloads-reports/](https://www.clxcommunications.com/help/downloads-reports/)\n\n\n**About CLX Communications**\n\nCLX Communications (CLX) is a leading CPaaS provider to enterprises and mobile operators.

{"text": "LONDON (AP) — The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, revealed in a deeply personal New York Times opinion piece on Wednesday that she suffered a miscarriage in July.  She shared her experience in hopes of helping others break the silence surrounding this common tragedy.\n\nMeghan described the morning as ordinary: \"Make breakfast. Feed the dogs. Take vitamins. Find that missing sock. Pick up the rogue crayon that rolled under the table. Throw my hair in a ponytail before getting my son from his crib.”  Then, after changing her son Archie’s diaper, \"I felt a sharp cramp. I dropped to the floor with him in my arms, humming a lullaby to keep us both calm, the cheerful tune a stark contrast to my sense that something was not right.”\n\nLater, in a hospital bed holding her husband Prince Harry's hand, she wrote, “I felt the clamminess of his palm and kissed his knuckles, wet from both our tears. Staring at the cold white walls, my eyes glazed over. I tried to imagine how we’d heal.”  The couple have an 18-month-old son, Archie.  Meghan wrote, “Losing a child means carrying an almost unbearable grief, experienced by many but talked about by few. In being invited to share our pain, together we take the first steps toward healing.”\n\nBritain’s National Health Service estimates that about one in eight pregnancies in which a woman is aware she is pregnant ends in miscarriage.  Sophie King, a midwife at U.K. child-loss charity Tommy’s, praised Meghan's openness. \"Her honesty and openness today send a powerful message to anyone who loses a baby: this may feel incredibly lonely, but you are not alone,” King said.  King added that miscarriage and stillbirth remain “a real taboo in society, so mothers like Meghan sharing their stories is a vital step in breaking down that stigma and shame.”\n\nBuckingham Palace declined to comment, stating it was “a deeply personal matter.”\n\nMeghan, 39, an American actress and star of TV legal drama “Suits,” married Harry, a grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, in May 2018.  Early this year, the couple stepped back from royal duties and relocated to North America, citing what they described as unbearable media intrusion and racist attitudes. They recently purchased a house in Santa Barbara, California.\n\nThe duchess is currently involved in a legal battle with the publisher of Britain’s Mail on Sunday newspaper over articles that published portions of a private letter she wrote to her estranged father after her wedding.  Last month, a London judge granted Meghan’s request to postpone the trial until fall 2021, keeping the reasons for the delay confidential."}

Esto incluye refugios, instalaciones sanitarias, atención médica y acceso a la información.  También solicitan una protección jurídica satisfactoria para los más vulnerables, especialmente mujeres y menores.\n\nMédicos del Mundo tiene un amplio operativo desplegado en Reggio Calabria.  Este operativo incluye una unidad móvil para consultas médicas en el puerto, otra especializada en atención psicosocial, y atención sanitaria en cuatro centros de primera acogida: Scatolone, Capitaneria, Montebello y Rosali.  Además, ofrecen servicios de intérpretes durante el desembarco, mediación cultural y  información sobre el derecho a la protección internacional a través de un equipo de trabajadores sociales.\n\nHasta el 30 de noviembre, registraron 1.055 visitas médicas en estos centros, muchas por quemaduras sufridas durante la travesía.  Repartieron más de 3.000 folletos informativos en el puerto y casi 1.200 menores participaron en actividades psicosociales.  Para los menores, las actividades grupales como el juego, el dibujo y la musicoterapia, gracias al voluntariado del museo de instrumentos de la región, son especialmente importantes. Con el apoyo de Médicos del Mundo, los niños han creado su propio boletín de noticias, 'Giornalino'.  Además, se proporcionó formación especializada a 300 profesionales, voluntarios y organizaciones locales. En este contexto, la formación en salud mental es crucial para gestionar \"reacciones normales ante situaciones anormales\", según una psicóloga de la organización."}

However, despite these achievements, DNNs remain susceptible to adversarial examples (Szegedy et al. 2014; Biggio et al. 2013).  Existing methods for generating adversarial examples primarily focus on two approaches:  L<sub>p</sub>-norm restricted attacks (Goodfellow, Shlens, and Szegedy 2015; Kurakin, Goodfellow, and Bengio 2017; Madry et al. 2018; Carlini and Wagner 2017; Moosavi-Dezfooli, Fawzi, and Frossard 2016) and unrestricted attacks (Brown et al. 2017; Hosseini and Poovendran 2018; Bhattad et al. 2020; Song et al. 2018; Qiu et al. 2020; Yuan et al. 2022).\n\nL<sub>p</sub>-norm attacks constrain perturbations to the raw pixel-space within a bounded norm to maintain photorealism.  Unrestricted attacks, on the other hand, employ methods like geometric distortions (Guo et al. 2018), color/texture changes (Hosseini and Poovendran 2018; Bhattad et al. 2020; Yuan et al. 2022), and semantic alterations (Qiu et al. 2020; Song et al. 2018).  A key limitation of most existing methods is the assumption that an attacker can freely modify any feature. This assumption is unrealistic in real-world scenarios.  For example, accessing the digital input of an image recognition model might be intractable, making pixel-space perturbations infeasible.  Furthermore, simply altering alterable features while ignoring the induced changes on other features overlooks the inherent causal relationships between them – a crucial aspect underappreciated by existing methods.\n\nConsider a credit scoring model.  Altering an applicant's income without adjusting the debt-to-income ratio is unrealistic, as the latter is directly influenced by the former.  This highlights the need to consider the causal generating process when crafting adversarial examples for practical applications.\n\nThis work introduces CADE, a framework for generating Counterfactual ADversarial Examples that incorporates the causal generating process.  CADE addresses two fundamental questions: 1) *Where to attack*: identifying vulnerable variables through a causal lens; and 2) *How to attack*: leveraging the causal generating process to create realistic adversarial examples.\n\nTo determine *where to attack*, CADE analyzes the vulnerability of discriminative DNNs to interventional data, exploiting their inability to reason causally, unlike human perception. For instance, a DNN might misclassify a car in space as a satellite, relying on the background rather than the object's inherent features (Figure 1).  CADE addresses this by explicitly analyzing the effects of interventions, guiding both observable and latent attacks.\n\nTo determine *how to attack*, CADE utilizes the concept of counterfactuals – predicting the consequences of interventions on variables given an observation.  Figure 1 illustrates this: intervening on the background changes the image while preserving other characteristics (color, shape) represented by exogenous variables.  CADE leverages the counterfactual generation framework (Pearl 2009), incorporating the causal generating process.  Recent advancements in causal discovery (Zheng et al. 2018; Yu et al. 2019), generative modeling (Kingma and Welling 2014; Goodfellow et al. 2014; Ho, Jain, and Abbeel 2020), and causal representation learning (Kocaoglu et al."}

The Irish southpaw had put his UFC career on hold in 2017 to box Mayweather, a bout he lost in 10 rounds.  Mayweather hinted at a potential rematch within the next 12 months by posting a mock-up poster featuring the pair, suggesting a 2020 clash.\n\nDana White confirmed in the post-fight press conference that he was in discussions with Mayweather.  \"Floyd Mayweather and I have been talking tonight, and we're working on something together,\" White stated. \"We're both in each other's plans, and we'll do something together this year.

{"text": "El gigante indio Reliance aspira a conquistar el mercado de telefonía móvil con un dispositivo de 50 dólares, proyectando ventas de entre 150 y 200 millones de unidades en dos años.  Esta ambiciosa estrategia, que recuerda a la disrupción que Reliance Jio causó en el sector de las telecomunicaciones,  supone un desafío directo a competidores como Xiaomi.  La compañía, liderada por Mukesh Ambani, ya se encuentra en negociaciones con ensambladores locales como Dixon Technologies India, Lava International y Karbonn Mobiles para producir una versión de su teléfono Jio, compatible con Android y con un precio aproximado de 4.000 rupias (54 dólares).  Este movimiento se alinea con la política gubernamental de impulsar la fabricación nacional, representando un importante estímulo para la industria local, que ensambló alrededor de 165 millones de smartphones en el último año.\n\nLa estrategia de Reliance se basa en combinar estos teléfonos económicos con los planes de bajo costo de su operador, Reliance Jio.  Ambani busca replicar el éxito obtenido en el sector de las telecomunicaciones, donde sus agresivos precios y la simplicidad de sus planes lo catapultaron a una posición dominante.  Este nuevo dispositivo podría acelerar la consolidación del imperio de Ambani, que abarca desde el comercio electrónico hasta las redes sociales y los videojuegos, aprovechando la enorme base de casi 400 millones de usuarios de Jio, muchos de los cuales utilizan teléfonos básicos de segunda generación.\n\nEl mercado potencial es inmenso.  En India, donde el PIB per cápita ronda los 2.000 dólares, el acceso a internet móvil, incluso a través de versiones lite de aplicaciones como WhatsApp o YouTube, se ha vuelto esencial.  Este factor explica que las tres cuartas partes de las ventas en el segundo trimestre de 2020 correspondieran a dispositivos básicos con precios entre 100 y 250 dólares, según Counterpoint.  Reliance, con su teléfono 4G, se dirige a los aproximadamente 350 millones de usuarios de teléfonos básicos, un segmento que Ambani describió recientemente como “atrapado en la era 2G”.\n\nLa pandemia ha acelerado la necesidad de actualizar los dispositivos, creando nuevas oportunidades.  Un ejemplo es la creciente demanda de teléfonos para que los niños puedan seguir las clases online.  Se estima que en India hay 250 millones de niños entre 6 y 16 años.  Neil Shah, director de investigación de Counterpoint, señala que si Reliance logra que un 10% de este segmento adquiera el nuevo dispositivo, la compañía podría convertirse en una de las marcas líderes de smartphones en 2021.  Además, la popularización de este teléfono impulsaría las perspectivas de Jio Platforms y, según Shah,  \"Jio tiene la oportunidad de apuntar a más de 500 millones de indios que no poseen un teléfono inteligente y generar una oportunidad en el mercado del océano azul\".  La colaboración con proveedores indios también impactaría negativamente a fabricantes chinos como Xiaomi, quienes, según Shah, \"perderán una oportunidad potencial y participación de mercado\".  El rival de Reliance, Bharti Airtel, también está explorando la posibilidad de desarrollar su propio dispositivo 4G, según medios locales.  Reliance, por su parte, lleva al menos dos años trabajando en prototipos y, aunque probablemente no llegue a tiempo para la temporada de compras de Diwali en noviembre,  tiene la capacidad de lanzar rápidamente el teléfono al mercado.  Ambani ha conseguido atraer más de 20 mil millones de dólares en inversiones de gigantes como Facebook para Jio Platforms, la subsidiaria encargada del proyecto."}

Curiosamente, ningún funcionario del oficialismo defendió el ajuste, cuya repercusión en las arcas provinciales es evidente. La defensa quedó a cargo de quienes lo votaron en el Congreso.

{"text": "Dislocations, line defects in the crystal lattice, govern the plastic deformation of metals under most conditions. Consequently, discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD), a computational method simulating the motion and interaction of dislocation lines, has become invaluable for studying metal plasticity at the mesoscale.  In DDD, dislocation lines are discretized into segments connecting nodes, whose positions evolve over time through the integration of nodal velocities [1]. Node motion arises from the dislocations' response to the driving force at each node, a function of the local stress acting along the dislocation lines. Because all dislocation lines interact elastically, calculating nodal forces for time-integration is typically the most computationally expensive simulation stage. This burden is exacerbated by the intrinsic stiffness and highly nonlinear behavior of the system, stemming from the nature of dislocation interactions, which necessitates small timesteps for traditional time-integrators and limits the achievable physical timescale. Despite recent algorithmic advances [2], the computational cost of DDD simulations remains a significant challenge.\n\nHere, we present a novel DDD-GNN framework, replacing the computationally intensive time-integration procedure with a graph neural network (GNN) trained to predict nodal displacements directly from nodal configurations and applied loading.  GNNs are particularly well-suited for this task, as dislocation line configurations are inherently graph-like. Our model leverages the common DDD practice of partitioning elastic interactions into short- and long-range components. By bypassing explicit short-range force calculations, our framework offers the potential for significant simulation acceleration. This approach distinguishes itself from previous machine learning applications in DDD, which focused on accelerating individual interaction force calculations [3], characterizing dislocation microstructures [4], or predicting crystal plasticity through stress/strain curves [5, 6, 7].\n\nWe demonstrate our approach using the fundamental case of a dislocation line gliding through an obstacle array under an imposed load. This widely employed model represents an important dislocation dynamics scenario used to study various dislocation-obstacle bypass mechanisms [8–18] and is relevant for applications such as solid solution strengthening and precipitate/irradiation-induced hardening. Our DDD-GNN model is trained on ground-truth DDD data to predict nodal displacements (effective velocities) across a range of obstacle densities and strain rates.  We show that the trained GNN time-integrator, implemented within the DDD framework, accurately reproduces the local dislocation motion behavior and predicts long-term simulation trajectories, including the correct saturation flow stress under different loading regimes.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the DDD method and introduces our hybrid DDD-GNN approach. Section 3 presents the dislocation-obstacle glide model and the training data.  Results are presented in Section 4, followed by a discussion in Section 5.  Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper."}

{"text": "The paper investigates the relationship between Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Wasserstein distance (W_p), and task-specific metrics in the context of compressive statistical learning (CSL).  This relationship is crucial for deriving learning guarantees in CSL, a framework designed for resource-efficient large-scale learning.\n\nCSL aims to summarize large datasets into compact sketches while preserving sufficient information for learning tasks.  This involves sketching operators that map datasets to lower-dimensional representations.  A key property for guaranteeing the effectiveness of these operators is the Lower Restricted Isometric Property (LRIP), often established by demonstrating that an MMD with a translation-invariant (TI) kernel dominates a task-specific metric (Kernel LRIP). This paper proposes a generalization, the Hölder LRIP, based on a more nuanced relationship between MMD and Wasserstein distances.\n\nSection 2 delves into the connection between W_p and MMD.  While connections exist between MMDs and regularized OT distances, less is known about the relationship with non-regularized W_p.  The section establishes conditions under which W_p can be bounded by MMD with a Hölder exponent (W_p ≲ MMD^δ), a crucial step towards the Hölder LRIP.  This involves defining a model set of distributions, restricting the generality of the bound.  The analysis focuses on MMDs associated with TI kernels, commonly used in large-scale learning algorithms.\n\nSection 3 explores the relationship between task-specific metrics and W_p.  It introduces the concept of \"Wasserstein regularity,\" which characterizes tasks where the task-specific metric can be bounded by W_p.  This section demonstrates that various unsupervised (e.g., K-means, PCA) and supervised (e.g., regression, classification with Lipschitz functions) learning tasks exhibit Wasserstein regularity.\n\nSection 4 introduces the CSL framework and its motivation.  It details how the relationships established in the previous sections contribute to a generalized LRIP, termed the Hölder LRIP.  The section argues that the Hölder LRIP offers advantages for CSL and presents associated learning guarantees.  It explains how CSL addresses the computational challenges of large-scale machine learning by summarizing datasets into smaller sketches and performing learning directly on these sketches.  This involves finding a low-dimensional subspace capturing sufficient information for the task.\n\nFigure 1 provides a visual overview of the paper's reasoning.  It illustrates the chain of relationships: TaskMetric ≲ W_p ≲ MMD^δ, and the final connection between MMD and the distance between sketches, which ultimately leads to the Hölder LRIP and CSL guarantees.  The paper's contributions thus provide a theoretical foundation for efficient large-scale learning by connecting task performance, Wasserstein distance, MMD, and the properties of sketching operators."}

The footage depicts the officer requesting Bembury's identification and then asking permission to search him for weapons.\n\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump, known for representing the family of George Floyd, asserts that Beverly Hills targets people of color through a task force known as the \"Operation Safe Street and Rodeo Drive Task Force.\"  Constitutional rights attorney Alexandria Kazarian stated, “The City of Beverly Hills Police Department has been under scrutiny for a long time.”\n\nThe lawsuit cites recent department statistics indicating the task force arrested 106 individuals: 105 African Americans and one Latino.  \"That's simply inexcusable,\" Kazarian commented.  \"There's absolutely no way the city of Beverly Hills can argue a non-racially motivated basis for those arrests.\"\n\nThe suit alleges that individuals were stopped for minor offenses like rollerskating, riding scooters, and jaywalking, and that many of these stops resulted in no charges due to lack of probable cause and evidence.  Kazarian added, \"If they're targeting people for these minor sidewalk infractions, a much broader demographic should be affected.\"\n\nBeverly Hills Police Chief Dominick Rivetti issued a statement explaining that the Rodeo Drive Team was formed in response to a significant increase in calls for service in the business district during the pandemic and subsequent civil unrest.  He noted the team recovered 13 loaded firearms from individuals on Rodeo Drive in just five weeks, a figure he described as unprecedented in Beverly Hills history.  The department also uncovered widespread fraudulent use of California unemployment benefits, recovering over $250,000 in cash and fraudulent EDD cards potentially worth $3 million.  Rivetti’s statement further emphasized, \"The men and women of BHPD take an oath to protect human life and enforce the law—regardless of race. Any violation of this pledge is contrary to the values of this department. We take all concerns regarding the conduct of our officers very seriously.\""}
{"text": "Jimmy Rollins (Photo by Webster Riddick)\nBy ROB MAADDI\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) —  As the Phillies celebrated Jackie Robinson Day along with the rest of baseball on Thursday and Friday, Jimmy Rollins, a rookie All-Star with the team 20 years ago, reflected on the declining percentage of Black players in Major League Baseball.  It was 13% then, and it’s down to 7.6% this year.\n\n“It’s more than just one thing,” Rollins told The Associated Press. Rollins attributed the decline to a combination of factors, including socioeconomic realities and a lack of effective marketing.\n\n“You need space to play baseball,” he said, noting the challenges for city kids. “You don’t have that in a lot of places. In the country, you can find a field. In the city, kids aren’t playing stickball…The expense [is high]—you need the tools, you’ve got to pay for travel teams…Also, you look at how baseball’s traditionally passed down from father to son. If your father isn’t around, the chances of you being exposed to baseball…are probably less likely.”  He contrasted this with basketball, where “you could pick up and dribble,” courts are easier to find than baseball fields, and fewer players are required.  He also pointed out how other sports benefit from sponsorships that are less common in baseball.\n\n\nRollins also criticized Major League Baseball’s marketing efforts. “The NBA and the NFL, those guys’ faces are plastered all over the screen. Baseball, there isn’t really a great deal of marketing,\" he said.  While acknowledging Mike Trout's deserved prominence, he believes other young Black players deserve more exposure.  He recalled a meeting with Spike Lee, MLB, and the players' union years ago to discuss commercials.  “Nothing ever came of that,\" Rollins said. “Not to knock MLB, but they’re going to do things that, at face value, look great. But the impact is minimal because there’s generally never any true follow-through.\"  He contrasted this with the marketing success of Ken Griffey Jr. and Barry Bonds during his youth.  “But when you start going outside of that select few, the sport itself isn’t marketing anyone else in a major way where kids from the inner cities are attracted to it,” he said.\n\nEven Rollins and teammate Ryan Howard, who won consecutive NL MVP awards in 2006 and 2007 as the core of a dominant Phillies team, didn't receive the marketing attention Rollins felt they deserved.  The team won five straight NL East titles, two NL pennants and the 2008 World Series, presenting ample marketing opportunities.\n\n\nRollins recently hosted a Bleacher Report series about being Black in MLB. The first part debuted on Jackie Robinson Day and featured conversations with Howard, Dwight Gooden, and 2020 Rookie of the Year Award winners Kyle Lewis and Devin Williams. Lewis and Williams were the first Black players to sweep the rookie awards since Gooden and Alvin Davis in 1984, three years before the award was renamed for Robinson."}
{"text": "Japan’s consumption of green tea has been steadily declining, but a new breed of casual cafes specializing in the traditional brew is aiming to reverse this trend.  These cafes introduce customers to a wide variety of brands and unconventional serving methods, hoping to reignite interest in the beverage.  Pioneering this movement was Iemon Salon Kyoto, opened about a decade ago by the Suntory Group.  Designed to evoke the atmosphere of traditional Kyoto machiya townhouses, Iemon Salon offers a modern take on tea culture, pairing green tea varieties like sencha, hōjicha, matcha, and gyokuro with meals, sweets, and even tea-based cocktails and beer. Prices range from ¥518 for sencha and hōjicha to ¥928 for a cup of gyokuro.  The cafe's manager emphasizes their mission: “We hope to deliver the culture and spirit of Japan to the world through tea.”\n\nFollowing in this innovative spirit is Tokyo Saryo, which opened in January in Tokyo's Sangenjaya district.  The location is fitting, as “Sangenjaya” translates to “three tea houses,” a name derived from the area’s history of tea establishments hundreds of years ago.  With its minimalist design featuring plaster walls and only nine seats surrounding the service counter, Tokyo Saryo encourages a focused tea-tasting experience.  The cafe offers rotating monthly menus featuring a selection of 25 tea brands.  Customers can sample two different brews of each tea: one at 70 degrees Celsius to highlight the tea's richness, and a second at 80 degrees Celsius to bring out its bitter and astringent notes.  Menus include detailed explanations of each brand's characteristics, catering to those less familiar with the nuances of green tea.  Sets are priced at ¥1,300 for two teas and sweets, or ¥800 for one tea and sweets.\n\nA key element of Tokyo Saryo’s approach is the interactive experience.  Staff are available to discuss the teas, offering insights into production areas and flavor profiles.  This educational aspect draws in both young Japanese and international visitors, providing an opportunity to discover new favorite varieties. One overheard conversation illustrates this engagement: a customer remarked, “This tea tastes deep,” to which a staff member responded, “When you make tea at a low temperature you get the (taste of) amino acids.  Some people have told me that the color makes it look like broth.”  This emphasis on education and discussion, coupled with the unique brewing method—hand-pouring hot water over the leaves, similar to hand-drip coffee—sets Tokyo Saryo apart.  As one staff member explains, “We are happy to answer any questions about tea… so you can enjoy the depth of the (world of) tea.”"}

{"text": "Driverless cars represent a significant advancement in modern society.  While partially autonomous vehicles exist today, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan project fully self-driving cars to be available by 2020. The article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" highlights several benefits, including enhanced safety features, such as the prevention of mobile device use while the vehicle is in autonomous mode.\n\nEach self-driving car will have specific regulations. While in self-driving mode, the operator must remain alert and keep both hands on the steering wheel.  A built-in sensor in the steering wheel ensures the driver can quickly and safely take control when road conditions demand human intervention.  Another feature allows for the instant shutdown of non-essential systems. For instance, in-car entertainment, while a privilege, can be deactivated when necessary.\n\nThese self-driving cars incorporate numerous other features, including GPS, tire pressure, motion, and radar sensors.  Many newer cars already utilize rear-view cameras displayed on the dashboard.  Vibrating seats alert the driver to potential collisions. With these advancements, the operating system of a self-driving car can effectively mimic a human driver.\n\nBeyond safety features, driverless cars also offer fuel efficiency. Projections indicate these vehicles will achieve significantly better gas mileage, potentially using half the fuel of current automobiles.  As Sergey Brin stated, \"Such cars would fundamentally change the world.\"  Not only will each tank of gas last longer, but harmful emissions will also be reduced.\n\nThe development of self-driving vehicles is a significant societal achievement."}
{"text": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs; Goodfellow et al., 2014) are a powerful class of deep generative models, but they are notoriously difficult to train (Salimans et al., 2016).  Numerous approaches have been proposed to improve GAN performance (Arjovsky, Chintala, and Bottou, 2017; Gulrajani et al., 2017; Miyato et al., 2018a; Sinha et al., 2020). Recent work (Wei et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020) suggests that incorporating consistency regularization techniques—popular in semi-supervised learning (Oliver et al., 2018)—can enhance generative model performance.  Specifically, Zhang et al. (2020) demonstrated that GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014) augmented with consistency regularization achieve state-of-the-art image synthesis results.  In their approach (CR-GAN), both real images and their augmented versions are fed into the discriminator, which is then encouraged—via an auxiliary loss term—to produce similar outputs for an image and its augmentation.\n\nWhile CR-GAN's consistency regularization is effective, applying augmentations only to real images creates an imbalance.  The generator can learn these artificial augmentation features and introduce them into generated samples as undesirable artifacts. Furthermore, by regularizing only the discriminator and using augmentations solely in image space, the regularization techniques in Wei et al. (2018) and Zhang et al. (2020) do not directly influence the generator.  Constraining the mapping from the latent space to generated samples could yield further performance gains beyond those achieved by discriminator-based consistency regularization.\n\nThis work introduces Improved Consistency Regularization (ICR), which applies consistency regularization to the generated images, the latent vector space, and the generator. First, we address the imbalance by introducing *balanced consistency regularization* (bCR), applying a consistency term on the discriminator to both real images and generated samples. Second, we introduce *latent consistency regularization* (zCR), incorporating regularization terms that modulate the sensitivity of both the generator and discriminator to changes in the latent space. Specifically, given augmented or perturbed latent vectors, we encourage the generator to be sensitive to these perturbations while encouraging the discriminator to remain insensitive.  The combination of bCR and zCR constitutes ICR.\n\nICR achieves state-of-the-art image synthesis results.  For unconditional image synthesis on CIFAR-10 and CelebA, ICR yields the best known FID scores across various GAN architectures.  For conditional image synthesis on CIFAR-10, we improve the state-of-the-art FID score from 11.48 to 9.21."}

{"text": "Reconstructing high-fidelity 3D scenes from captured imagery is crucial for scalable 3D content creation.  For these reconstructed environments to function as \"digital twins\" in applications like augmented reality and gaming, they must be compatible with modern graphics pipelines and renderable under user-specified lighting.  This necessitates reconstructing not only 3D geometry and texture, but also intrinsic scene properties like materials and lighting. This challenging, ill-posed problem is often referred to as inverse rendering [1].\n\nNeural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) [34] have emerged as a powerful neural reconstruction technique, enabling photorealistic novel-view synthesis.  NeRFs can be reconstructed from posed camera images in minutes [14, 35, 43] and scale to room-sized scenes and beyond [45, 48, 55], making them attractive for augmented/virtual reality and digital twin generation. However, NeRFs intertwine intrinsic scene properties with incident light, limiting novel-view synthesis to the fixed lighting conditions of the input images; they cannot be relighted [42].\n\nWhile NeRF can be extended to a full inverse rendering formulation [3], this requires computationally expensive volume rendering integrals for multiple light bounces.  Estimating secondary rays necessitates querying NeRF's volumetric density field along the path from each surface point to all light sources, scaling with O(nm) per point, where *n* is the number of samples per ray and *m* is the number of light sources or Monte Carlo samples for global illumination.  To manage this cost, prior work has focused on single objects with often a single, known light source [42], approximating direct/indirect lighting with a visibility MLP [42, 64] rather than volumetric rendering of secondary rays.\n\nIn contrast, explicit mesh-based representations enable efficient rendering.  With known mesh topology, estimating primary and secondary rays involves ray-mesh intersection (O(m)) queries, efficiently computed with libraries like OptiX [39].  However, inverse rendering with meshes either assumes a fixed topology [13] or recovers the mesh via an SDF on a volumetric grid [36], limiting resolution.  Consequently, these methods have yielded high-quality results primarily for smaller, object-centric scenes.\n\nThis work introduces FEGR<sup>1</sup>, a hybrid rendering pipeline combining the strengths of neural fields and explicit meshes for inverse rendering of large urban scenes.  We represent intrinsic scene properties with a neural field, rendering primary rays (G-buffer) via volumetric rendering.  For secondary rays generating higher-order lighting effects (e.g., specular highlights, cast shadows), we convert the neural field to an explicit mesh and employ physics-based rendering.  The neural field captures high-resolution detail, while the mesh enables efficient secondary ray tracing.  This differentiable hybrid rendering is embedded in an optimization scheme to estimate spatially-varying 3D material properties, geometry, and HDR lighting from posed camera images<sup>2</sup>.  Modeling HDR properties makes our representation suitable for AR applications like virtual object insertion requiring spatially-varying lighting for physically accurate cast shadows.\n\nOur contributions are:\n\n*   A novel neural field representation decomposing the scene into geometry, spatially-varying materials, and HDR lighting.\n*   A hybrid renderer combining volumetric and physics-based rendering for efficient ray tracing within a neural scene representation, enabling high-quality inverse rendering of large urban scenes.\n*   HDR lighting and material modeling, benefiting applications like relighting and virtual object insertion with cast shadows.\n\nFEGR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in novel-view synthesis under varying lighting on the NeRF-OSR dataset [40]. We also present qualitative results on an autonomously-collected, single-illumination urban environment capture.  Furthermore, we demonstrate intrinsic rendering results and virtual object insertion.  Finally, a user study confirms a significant preference for our method's results over baselines."}
{"text": "Fog computing, a nascent paradigm, merges the strengths of edge and cloud computing [8, 31].  For low latency, application components are deployed near the edge, close to end-users. This proximity also reduces bandwidth consumption, mitigates privacy risks, and enables continued edge operation during network partitions.  Conversely, for high scalability, components can leverage powerful machines like cloudlets [50] within the core network [8] or reside directly in the cloud. This comprehensive execution environment, often called \"fog\" [8, 9], encompasses all devices along the \"cloud-to-thing continuum\" [36]. Despite its numerous advantages, fog computing has seen limited application development, and commercial deployments remain nascent [57].  The primary hurdle is arguably the deployment and management of physical infrastructure, especially at the edge, contrasting sharply with the ease of cloud adoption [8].\n\nThis infrastructural challenge impacts the entire fog application lifecycle, affecting not only production system operation but also application testing. While initial design questions can be addressed through simulation [e.g., 10, 17, 20], practical testing on physical infrastructure becomes essential.  However, access to this infrastructure is typically fleeting, available only between physical deployment and production launch.  Before this window, the infrastructure may not exist, and afterward, its capacity is dedicated to production. This lack of access hinders complex integration tests and benchmarks, such as those for fault-tolerance in wide-area deployments, leaving developers reliant on conjecture, small local testbeds, and simulations. Existing infrastructure emulation approaches often focus solely on emulating edge devices [e.g., 22, 44].  Others emulate core network or cloud infrastructure but lack automated experiment orchestration [e.g., 12, 32].\n\nThis paper extends our preliminary work [21] by proposing the evaluation of fog applications on a cloud-based emulated infrastructure testbed, manipulated by a pre-defined orchestration schedule.  In this emulated fog environment, virtual cloud machines are configured to closely mirror the real (or planned) fog infrastructure. Using network characteristic data from the production environment or based on expectations and experience, interconnections between emulated fog machines are manipulated to exhibit similar behavior.  Similarly, performance measurements from real fog machines inform resource limits on Dockerized application containers. This allows for full cloud deployment of fog applications while replicating the performance and failure characteristics of a real deployment."}

{"text": "Driverless cars present a complex dilemma, promising significant advantages while raising serious concerns. While proponents emphasize increased safety and convenience, the reality of transitioning to autonomous vehicles is fraught with challenges.  My primary concern lies with the level of human oversight still required, seemingly negating the concept of a truly \"driverless\" experience.\n\nCurrently, Google's autonomous vehicles, despite impressive mileage without major accidents, require driver intervention in various situations, such as navigating driveways, traffic, roadwork, and accidents.  The cars alert the driver, who must then steer, accelerate, and brake. This necessitates constant vigilance, demanding drivers keep their hands on the wheel and remain prepared to take control.  This begs the question: how \"driverless\" are these cars if constant human oversight is necessary?  Such a system seems to introduce another layer of complexity, potentially increasing the risk of human error due to complacency or delayed reaction times.\n\nFurthermore, the argument that driverless cars will reduce accidents seems flawed.  While eliminating human error is a goal, the reliance on complex automated systems introduces new potential failure points. What happens if the system malfunctions?  The driver, expected to remain alert despite the autonomous nature of the vehicle, must react instantly to regain control, potentially creating a more dangerous scenario than if they were driving conventionally.\n\nThe supposed benefits, such as fuel efficiency and flexibility, also warrant scrutiny.  While Sergey Brin's vehicles reportedly consume less fuel, the overall environmental impact of manufacturing and maintaining these complex systems remains to be seen.  Moreover, the flexibility offered compared to public transportation needs further examination, particularly regarding individual needs and accessibility."}

{"text": "The design of numerous autonomous platforms is guided by the principle of modularity. A typical robot's autonomy stack, for instance, comprises separate modules for perception, planning, and control [24]. These modules often operate at different frequencies and levels of abstraction, despite the need for safe, real-time task execution with limited onboard computational resources.  Higher levels of abstraction generally enable faster decision-making. However, significant discrepancies in abstraction levels across modules can lead to unexpected and unsafe system behavior.  Choosing appropriate abstraction levels in robotics has remained largely an art. This work focuses on developing a quantitative, data-driven method to bridge the potential mismatch between trajectory planning and control modules.\n\nAlthough trajectory planning and control are extensively studied in robotics, challenges persist. Graph-search-based path planning algorithms can struggle to incorporate complex nonlinear system dynamics.  Similarly, real-time optimization-based trajectory generation methods typically employ simplified or reduced-order dynamics models. Conversely, low-level feedback control policies often rely on more accurate, detailed system dynamics for tracking reference trajectories generated by the aforementioned approaches. This layered approach, while conceptually appealing, is effective only when higher-layer outputs are compatible with lower-layer capabilities.\n\nThis paper focuses on the interplay between trajectory generation and feedback control.  Rather than imposing a layered architecture, we demonstrate its derivation through a suitable relaxation of a global nonlinear optimal control problem that jointly encodes both trajectory generation and feedback control. Critically, the resulting trajectory generation optimization problem becomes dynamics-aware through a tracking penalty regularizer, encoding the dynamic feasibility of a generated trajectory.  While this tracking penalty generally lacks a closed-form expression, we interpret it as a cost-to-go, learnable from system roll-outs using tools from machine learning for any feedback control policy. We evaluate our framework using unicycle and quadrotor control, comparing our approach to standard quadrotor trajectory generation methods in simulation.  Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our data-driven, dynamics-aware framework enables faster computation of accurately trackable trajectories in both simulation and hardware.\n\nOur contributions are:\n\n* Deriving a layered control architecture with a dynamics-aware trajectory generator (top layer) and a feedback controller (low layer).  Our trajectory generation problem is inherently dynamics-aware, incorporating a tracking penalty regularizer that encodes the low-layer controller's tracking ability.\n* Showing that the tracking penalty can be viewed as a system's cost-to-go, and thus learned from system rollouts.\n* Applying our data-driven, dynamics-aware trajectory generation framework to unicycle and quadrotor control problems.  We demonstrate that our approach generates aggressive yet easily trackable trajectories compared to standard methods for both systems.\n\nSection 3 formulates the dynamics-aware trajectory planning problem, using the unicycle and waypoint tracking problem as running examples. Section 4 presents a result showing how relaxing the underlying nonlinear control problem naturally leads to a trajectory optimization problem with a regularizer capturing the controller's tracking cost. We also describe our supervised learning approach for learning the cost-to-go function characterizing the feedback control layer's tracking ability."}

{"text": "Old Master paintings are frequently examined technically, to analyze artistic materials and techniques, or to support conservation and restoration.  Recent years have witnessed a digital revolution in this field, with widespread adoption of advanced analytical and imaging technologies generating large, multi-dimensional datasets [1] - [3].  Traditional X-radiographs, despite their long history, remain crucial for technical study, conservation, and preservation due to their ability to penetrate a painting's stratigraphy [4], [5].  X-rays reveal a painting's condition (e.g., subsurface losses and damage), the status of paint passages (identifying retouching, fills, or other interventions), and information about the support (canvas type or panel construction).  Crucially, X-ray images also provide insights into the artist's layering process, revealing *pentimenti*—changes made during painting, including concealed earlier designs painted over during revisions or when supports were reused.  Research from the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam indicates that nearly 15% (20 of 130) of Van Gogh's paintings contain such concealed images [6].\n\nConsequently, there is significant interest in visualizing these hidden designs to better understand artworks and artistic practice.  Various imaging modalities have been employed to enhance visualization of concealed images [7], improve imaging of underdrawings [8] - [11], or reveal overwritten texts in palimpsests.  Several studies have proposed X-ray image separation approaches [14] - [18]. However, these methods typically apply to double-sided painting panels where, in addition to the mixed X-ray image, researchers have access to RGB images of both the front and back.\n\nThis paper addresses a more challenging scenario, where only the mixed X-ray image (Fig. 1b) and a single RGB image of the visible painting (Fig. 1a) are available.  Extracting concealed images from mixed X-rays is complex because these images are two-dimensional representations of three-dimensional artworks.  A single X-ray captures features from both the concealed and surface designs, as well as the support (e.g., canvas weave or wood grain), making it difficult for experts to distinguish elements of the concealed painting (see Fig. 1).\n\nInspired by our previous work [19], we propose a new deep learning-based approach to separate mixed X-ray images of paintings with concealed designs into their hypothetical constituents: X-ray images of the visible painting and the concealed image. Our entirely self-supervised approach leverages only the mixed X-ray image and the RGB image of the painting.  This method has been applied to real paintings, including Francisco de Goya's portrait of Doña Isabel de Porcel (Fig."}
{"text": "Deep learning features, extracted using deep neural networks trained on extensive datasets [1], differ significantly from handcrafted features like HOG [2] and SIFT [3].  The success of deep learning in computer vision and improved network infrastructure have fueled a growing interest in deep learning feature compression within the Analysis-then-Compress (ATC) paradigm [4].  ATC allows for direct feature extraction at the front-end, transmitting compact feature representations instead of raw video data, contrasting with the Compress-then-Analysis (CTA) paradigm, where videos are compressed before transmission to the cloud for analysis. This advantage has led to widespread research on ATC with both handcrafted and deep learning features to address the challenges of video big data.\n\nNumerous algorithms exist for compact feature representation.  Hash-based models like DBH [5] and vector quantization methods such as PQ [6] and OPQ [7] target compact representation of handcrafted features.  Binary descriptors like BRIEF [8] and USB [9] enable efficient Hamming distance computation.  For deep learning features, approaches include applying video coding principles [10], combining supervised learning with hash compression (DHN) [11], and intermediate deep feature compression [12].\n\nThe promise of ATC has driven standardization efforts for compact feature representation.  MPEG's CDVS and CDVA standards define standardized bitstream syntax for interoperability in image/video retrieval.  The ongoing MPEG VCM standardization effort [13, 14] aims for accurate, low-latency, object-oriented analysis based on compact video representation for machine vision. VCM builds upon feature compression advancements and connects compact feature representation with video compression for both machine vision and human perception, as features can be used in diverse machine vision tasks.\n\nInspired by recent advances in deep learning-based video coding [15], this work proposes further compressing raw deep learning features using deep neural networks.  Our contributions are threefold:\n\n* We introduce an end-to-end coding scheme for compactly representing deep learning features as a latent code, pursuing optimal feature-in-feature representation via rate-distortion optimization.\n* We propose a compact feature enhancement method, improving feasibility in feature coding.  This method employs a teacher-student enhancement module at the latent code level, enabling adaptive switching between complex decoding and high bit rate representation.\n* We implement this framework using facial features and demonstrate superior rate-accuracy performance compared to popular feature compression schemes."}

He supports this conclusion with several compelling reasons.\n\nFirst, he highlights our significant lack of knowledge about the planet.  As he points out in paragraph 2, no spacecraft has landed on Venus in over three decades, leaving a substantial gap in our understanding.  This lack of knowledge itself justifies further exploration.\n\nSecond, the author frames the inherent dangers of Venus exploration not as deterrents, but as challenges to overcome. In paragraph 6, he emphasizes the need to accept risks and embrace the scientific challenge presented by Venus's hostile environment. He reinforces this idea in paragraph 8, arguing that striving to meet these challenges has inherent value, and that space exploration should not be limited by danger or doubt.\n\nFinally, he contends that the potential rewards of understanding Venus outweigh the risks.  By suggesting that exploring Venus is \"worth something\" (paragraph 8), he implies that the potential scientific discoveries and technological advancements gained from such a mission would be significant.\n\nOverall, the author presents a well-reasoned argument for renewed Venus exploration. He effectively uses the current knowledge gap, the inherent challenges, and the potential rewards to support his claim, making a compelling case for taking on the risks involved."}

{"text": "OTTAWA -- The constantly shifting rules around social gatherings and outings during the COVID-19 pandemic are leaving many Ottawa residents bewildered.  The Ontario Government’s frequent adjustments to permitted activities have become difficult to track, leaving many feeling lost. As Infection Control Epidemiologist Colin Furness puts it, \"I don’t think anyone now can remember what is the appropriate size of a gathering.\"\n\nThis confusion is fueled by what Furness describes as conflicting directions from all levels of government, hindering the fight against COVID-19.  He highlights the seeming contradictions in the rules: \"You can be in a store with dozens and dozens of people, and that's ok. But if you know their name then it's a gathering, and a limit applies.\"  He further points out the inconsistencies: \"You can be in a restaurant, as long as it’s nominally six people to a table or a bar, with a couple dozen of your best friends. No one’s wearing a mask. Everyone’s hugging and singing and shouting. And you can do that, we say that's ok. But you can’t do it in your living room. The reality of course is that it's not ok at all.\"\n\nThe recent pause on social circles, limiting close contact to household members, announced by the Ford government on Friday, has only added to the confusion, particularly regarding its application to public spaces. This announcement sparked immediate online reactions.  On Facebook, Leslie McDougall wrote: \"Hard to keep up with all the 'rules' when they literally change every day. I’m all for flying by the seat of your pants but this is ridiculous.\"  Caroline Brisebois echoed this sentiment: \"The restrictions do not make sense. No family Thanksgiving but we can put 20-30 kids in a classroom or 70 kids on a bus. We can go to bars and restaurants. No wonder people are fed up!\"\n\nFurness believes the solution lies in simplifying the rules: \"Do not be in a room with anyone else without a mask, unless you live with them. That’s it. Don’t go to restaurants. Don’t go to bars. Don’t go to gatherings. Don’t do it.\"  He stresses the need for clear communication from the Ontario Government, advocating for firm rules, not suggestions: \"We need to establish what is a rule and call it a rule. Not a suggestion. So things aren’t optional.\"  He points to Ontario’s top doctor, whom Premier Doug Ford has consistently defended, as the source of this needed clarity: \"I’ve come to the conclusion after watching very carefully that Dr. (David) Williams does not understand public health.”\n\nIn late September, Ontario capped unmonitored private social gatherings at 10 people indoors and 25 outdoors.

{"text": "The field of fair division explores methods for dividing and allocating resources among agents fairly.  A classic problem within this field, first introduced by Steinhaus [Ste48], is cake-cutting. The \"cake\" acts as a metaphor for a divisible and heterogeneous resource—one that can be divided arbitrarily, with different parts holding varying values for different agents. Examples include dividing land, time, or other natural resources.  Cake-cutting has been extensively studied in mathematics and economics [BT96, RW98] and, more recently, in computer science [Pro13].\n\nFormally, the cake is represented as the interval [0, 1], and *n* agents possess individual valuation functions (*vᵢ*) assigning values to cake pieces. The goal is to divide the cake into *n* pieces (*A₁*, ..., *Aₙ*) and allocate one piece to each agent fairly.  Steinhaus [Ste48], with Banach and Knaster, initially focused on *proportionality*: an allocation is proportional if *vᵢ(Aᵢ) ≥ vᵢ([0, 1])/n* for all agents *i*.  While proportionality guarantees a fair share, an agent might still prefer another agent's piece.\n\nA stronger fairness notion, *envy-freeness*, addresses this.  An allocation is envy-free if *vᵢ(Aᵢ) ≥ vᵢ(Aⱼ)* for all agents *i, j*. Popularized by Gamow and Stern [GS58], envy-free cake-cutting has been extensively researched. Stromquist [Str80] and Woodall [Woo80] proved the existence of connected (contiguous) envy-free allocations under mild continuity assumptions – meaning each agent receives a single interval, requiring only *n-1* cuts.\n\nWhile existence is proven via tools like Brouwer's fixed point theorem and Sperner's lemma [Str80, Woo80, Su99], these methods don't provide efficient algorithms.  This poses a practical challenge.  Moving-knife procedures have been proposed [BTZ97], but their informal definitions hinder theoretical analysis.  Recent computer science research has formalized the computational models, yet the complexity of envy-free cake-cutting remains elusive.\n\nThis paper examines connected envy-free cake-cutting.  For two agents, the cut-and-choose protocol provides a simple, envy-free solution implementable in the Robertson-Webb query model [WS07]. For three or more agents, finding envy-free allocations using Robertson-Webb queries is impossible [Str08].  Brânzei and Nisan [BN22] suggest studying *ε-envy-free* allocations: *vᵢ(Aᵢ) ≥ vᵢ(Aⱼ) - ε* for all *i, j*."}
{"text": "The increasing interest in extending the generative power of pretrained text-to-image (T2I) models to text-to-video (T2V) generation is evident in recent research [5, 9–12, 14, 20, 27, 33].  Zero-shot T2V methods [10, 12, 14] aim to adapt image diffusion models for video generation without further training, leveraging their ability to generate frame sequences from video text prompts.  However, generating coherent dynamic scenes in videos remains a challenge due to the concise and abstract nature of these prompts.\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their capacity to generate layouts for controlling visual modules, particularly image generation models [3, 19, 32]. This suggests the potential for LLMs to interpret complex video prompts and generate fine-grained spatio-temporal layouts for guiding video synthesis.  Generating such layouts for video, however, is more complex, requiring LLMs to understand and depict object movement and transformation over time.\n\nRecent zero-shot T2V research [10, 12] has explored using LLMs to decompose video text into frame-level descriptions, representing individual moments or events within the video to guide image diffusion models towards semantically coherent video generation.  However, these descriptions often capture only basic temporal semantics, lacking the detailed spatio-temporal information necessary for smooth object motion and consistent frame-to-frame coherence.  Furthermore, representing global background movement, crucial for depicting camera motion and creating immersive video experiences [8, 30], adds another layer of complexity.\n\nThis paper introduces FlowZero, a novel framework integrating LLMs and image diffusion models to generate temporally coherent videos from text prompts. FlowZero leverages LLMs to analyze and translate the video text prompt into a structured Dynamic Scene Syntax (DSS).  Unlike previous methods that provide only basic semantic descriptions, the DSS includes scene descriptions, foreground object layouts, and background motion patterns.  Foreground layouts consist of a series of bounding boxes defining the spatial arrangement of each frame and tracking changes in object positions and sizes, ensuring coherent object motion and transformation aligned with the text prompt.  Crucially, FlowZero incorporates an iterative self-refinement process to enhance the alignment between generated layouts and textual descriptions, addressing inaccuracies such as spatial and temporal errors.  This process iteratively compares and adjusts the layouts against the text through a feedback loop, ensuring high-fidelity and coherent spatio-temporal layouts.\n\nTo enhance temporal coherence and consistency, FlowZero prompts LLMs to predict background motion patterns, which can control global scenes and camera motion.  For example, if the text describes a horse running from right to left, as illustrated in Figure 1 (middle), the LLM predicts a corresponding left-to-right camera motion, enhancing the video's immersiveness [8, 30].  This background motion pattern includes specific directions and speeds.  We introduce motion-guided noise shifting (MNS), which shifts the initial noise of each frame according to the predicted background motion, resulting in smoother video synthesis.\n\nFlowZero represents a significant advancement in zero-shot text-to-video synthesis, leveraging the spatio-temporal planning capabilities of LLMs to generate detailed frame-by-frame syntax. This fusion of technologies within the FlowZero framework enables the generation of temporally coherent and visually appealing videos directly from text prompts.\n\nOur contributions are summarized as follows: We introduce an iterative self-refinement process for improving generated spatio-temporal layouts."}

Unlike traditional vehicles where human drivers are expected to be alert, AVs demand a shared vigilance.  Current traffic laws are predicated on human control, placing responsibility squarely on the driver.  With AVs, this responsibility becomes more diffuse. While proponents argue that sensors and monitoring systems will prevent accidents, the question remains: what happens when these systems fail? Human drivers are responsible for maintaining their vehicles; however, ensuring the constant, perfect operation of complex AV technology presents a significant challenge.  A driver may not be equipped to diagnose or address a malfunctioning system, potentially leading to catastrophic consequences.\n\nFurthermore, the safety of those outside the AV is a critical concern.  Even with a perfectly functioning AV, the unpredictable actions of other drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians introduce significant risk.  Pedestrians, in particular, are vulnerable as they have no control over the AV's actions.  A malfunctioning sensor or software glitch could lead to pedestrian injuries or fatalities, raising complex questions of liability.  Even minor technical issues could have devastating consequences.\n\nWhile the convenience of not driving may be attractive, the potential for malfunctions during operation is substantial. Proponents might argue that proper maintenance is the solution. However, ensuring the continuous, flawless performance of a complex technological system is far more challenging than routine car maintenance. A significant concern is the driver's potential inability to recognize or resolve technical issues, leading to unexpected breakdowns or malfunctions.\n\nThe allure of autonomous vehicles is undeniable, especially given their potential to alleviate the burden of driving.  However, prioritizing safety and ensuring robust, reliable technology are crucial.  Technology, however sophisticated, is fallible. The potential for failure necessitates a cautious approach to the widespread adoption of AVs."}

There are days when I ask myself why I even bother saying anything. They're ignoring me, but I know they can hear me. Why would they continue to stare at me if they couldn't? These mannequins can't talk, though.  If they could, then their silence would be a deliberate taunt.\n\nToday, we were sitting at the dinner table. I dressed her in her favorite dress, a pink blouse with a flowery pattern. She looked stunning, the perfect image of beauty. I asked her to perform a simple task: pass the salt. It was so simple. Yet she ignored me. She just sat there. So I yelled. I yelled and yelled and yelled for hours until my voice hurt. Now it hurts to even say anything. I am trapped within myself.\n\nI've decided to stop saying anything. My voice hurts too much anyway. What is the difference between me and them? I can no longer talk.

{"text": "Driverless cars present several significant challenges that warrant serious consideration before widespread development and adoption.  These concerns, primarily focused on technological reliability, safety implications, and the potential erosion of essential driving skills, collectively suggest that further development should proceed with caution.\n\nThe core issue lies in the inherent fallibility of technology.  As any technology can malfunction, driverless cars are susceptible to crashes and system errors. This raises critical questions of liability.  If a technological failure leads to an accident, who bears responsibility – the \"driver\" or the manufacturer? This legal and ethical grey area remains unresolved. While convenience is a strong selling point for driverless technology, ease of use should not overshadow fundamental safety concerns.\n\nThese safety concerns are amplified by the potential for sensor failures, which could lead to collisions.  Furthermore, the widespread adoption of driverless cars could lead to a decline in driving skills among the general population. If driving licenses become unnecessary, the essential knowledge and experience required to operate a vehicle could diminish, potentially creating a dangerous situation in emergencies or if autonomous systems fail.\n\nThis lack of knowledge and experience ties directly into the potential for increased societal laziness. While not everyone would become complacent, the convenience of driverless cars could discourage many from actively maintaining their driving skills. This over-reliance on technology could have detrimental consequences in the long run, limiting individual autonomy and potentially hindering responses to unforeseen circumstances.  We should strive to enhance, not diminish, essential life skills."}

However, the author fails to effectively support this claim, instead frequently providing evidence that reinforces the opposite position.\n\nThe author primarily focuses on the difficulties and risks associated with exploring Venus.  For example, they state, \"it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely\" and \"Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.\"  The entire third paragraph further emphasizes these challenges, noting, \"These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth.\" This accumulation of evidence highlighting the dangers of Venus undermines the author's argument for its exploration.\n\nWhile the author claims that pursuing the study of Venus is worthwhile, they simultaneously acknowledge the obstacles to obtaining further data.  The author points out, \"More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance.\"  Even the proposed solution of using a blimp-like vehicle to send humans is presented alongside the caveat of \"toasty\" 170-degree Fahrenheit temperatures.  This again reinforces the difficulties of Venusian exploration, weakening the central argument.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's argument that Venus is worth exploring despite the dangers is poorly supported. The provided evidence primarily focuses on the immense challenges and risks involved, essentially supporting the counterargument that exploring Venus is impractical, if not impossible."}
{"text": "The \"Face on Mars\" has sparked considerable debate. While some believe it's an artificial structure, the scientific consensus points towards a natural landform.  Scientists have presented evidence supporting this conclusion, drawing parallels between the \"Face\" and geological formations found on Earth, such as those in Idaho's Snake River Plain. The article highlights the resemblance between the Martian feature and terrestrial lava domes, specifically mentioning Middle Butte in Idaho.  High-resolution images captured by advanced cameras further solidify this comparison, reinforcing the natural landform theory.\n\nThis resemblance to Earthly formations is a key argument. The article emphasizes the visual similarities between the \"Face\" and specific locations in Idaho, strengthening the case for it being a lava dome. The detailed photographs provide compelling visual evidence supporting this interpretation.\n\nFew scientists entertain the idea of the \"Face\" being an alien artifact.  They argue that it lacks the characteristics of an artificially constructed object. While it might bear a superficial resemblance to a human face, scientific evidence does not support this interpretation.  Researchers maintain, with supporting evidence, that it is simply a natural formation.\n\nDespite public speculation about the \"Face\" resembling a human face, the scientific community remains unconvinced.  Scientists point to evidence supporting their conclusion, including analyses debunking theories about the \"Face\" being evidence of extraterrestrial life on Mars. The article even mentions how the initial hype surrounding the \"Face\" was largely fueled by speculation and conspiracy theories.\n\nIn conclusion, the prevailing scientific view, supported by considerable evidence, is that the \"Face on Mars\" is a natural landform."}
{"text": "In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author argues that studying Venus is a worthwhile endeavor despite its inherent dangers.  The author notes a significant interest in Venusian exploration due to the planet's similarities to Earth. However, Venus presents formidable obstacles to close-range study. Its dense atmosphere, scorching temperatures, and crushing atmospheric pressure—far exceeding Earth's—mean no spacecraft has survived on its surface for more than a few hours. This hostile environment makes direct human exploration extremely difficult.\n\nThe author effectively supports the argument for studying Venus despite these dangers. Providing compelling evidence and detailed explanations, the author states, \"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\" This quote clearly demonstrates the author's well-supported rationale for Venusian exploration.\n\nWhile Venus remains a perilous destination for human exploration, the potential rewards justify the risks."}

{"text": "The 28-day compressive strength is a widely accepted metric for characterizing concrete performance in engineering applications.  While this standardized index primarily evaluates the ultimate strength of concrete mixtures [1], it also serves as a convenient measure for inferring other critical mechanical properties like elastic modulus, stiffness, and tensile strength [2]. Accurate strength predictions are crucial for efficient and high-quality construction. Insufficient strength can lead to catastrophic infrastructure failures, while overdesigned strength results in higher material costs [3] and increased environmental burdens like CO2 emissions from cement production [4].\n\nOver the past decades, considerable effort has been devoted to developing predictive models correlating concrete mixture proportions with strength performance [5].  An ideal model not only predicts strength but also provides insights for designing concrete with improved constructability, durability, and/or lower cost [6, 7]. Conventional approaches often rely on physics or chemistry-based relationships [8, 9, 10]. While the influence of major proportioning parameters like water-to-cementitious ratio (w/cm), aggregate fraction, and air void content has been extensively studied, other factors like chemical and mineral admixtures or aggregate gradation also play a role [11].  However, the complexity of these property-strength correlations makes developing a robust and universal concrete strength model using conventional approaches challenging [12].\n\nMachine learning (ML) offers a data-driven alternative for strength prediction.  ML-based predictions have demonstrated superior performance compared to conventional approaches, particularly for non-linear problems [13].  Without relying on physical or chemical assumptions, ML can extract hidden, non-intuitive feature patterns directly from data, making it a promising approach for predicting concrete strength [14, 15, 16, 17].\n\nHowever, ML algorithms typically require large datasets to effectively learn the input-output relationships [18, 19]. This poses a challenge for concrete strength applications due to limited access to industrial concrete strength data, which is often incomplete, lacking information on factors like curing temperature, additives, and aggregate types.  Accurate and consistent data is essential for ML, but concrete strength data can be inconsistent due to non-standardized measurements and data recording practices [20]. For instance, concrete strength can vary significantly depending on the testing protocol or specimen size [21, 22, 23].  While large datasets can mitigate these issues, their impact is magnified with smaller datasets.  Therefore, it's crucial to assess how the reliability of ML-based concrete strength prediction depends on the amount of training data.\n\nThis study addresses two core questions: (i) how much data is sufficient for training an ML model, and (ii) which ML algorithms are best suited for small datasets. Building on our previous work [17, 24], we explore these questions using three archetypal learning algorithms: polynomial regression (PR), artificial neural network (ANN), and random forest (RF)."}

{"text": "The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) offers potential benefits for educators and students, but its imperfections raise concerns about its practical application in schools.  While FACS could personalize online learning experiences, its limitations may ultimately outweigh its advantages.\n\nIn theory, FACS could enhance online education by analyzing students' facial expressions to gauge their understanding, engagement, and emotional state.  If a student appears confused, the system could adapt the lesson to provide additional support.  Similarly, if boredom is detected, the course could adjust to recapture the student's attention.  This personalized approach could significantly improve the effectiveness of online learning.\n\nHowever, FACS is not without its flaws.  Its accuracy in interpreting facial expressions is imperfect, potentially misidentifying emotions and leading to inappropriate adjustments to the learning material. For instance, a student might be confused about something unrelated to the course, yet FACS might misinterpret this as confusion with the lesson itself.  Furthermore, students could manipulate the system by feigning emotions to access easier content designed for those requiring additional assistance. This potential for manipulation undermines the integrity of online assessments and personalized learning pathways.\n\nUltimately, the potential for misinterpretation and manipulation outweighs the theoretical benefits of FACS in an educational setting."}

However, current evaluations often overlook the contribution of naturally occurring signal reflections, which can play a similar role, and thus risk overstating the advantages of RIS deployment [3].  For instance, in outdoor around-the-corner scenarios, reflections from existing structures can contribute as much power as a small RIS (e.g., 0.3 m × 0.3 m), meaning that only considerably larger RISs would offer substantial gains.\n\nThis effect is potentially even more pronounced in indoor settings, where ambient propagation is significant yet rarely considered in RIS evaluations [4, 5].  Therefore, this paper benchmarks the power delivered by a RIS against the power naturally reaching a receiver in an indoor environment. Focusing on a simple yet representative scenario—an empty room with an obstructed LOS path—we employ an exact assessment method to avoid artifacts. This setup captures the dominant high-frequency indoor propagation mechanism: reflection from flat surfaces. The obstructed LOS path is a key consideration, as this is the scenario where both ambient propagation and a RIS become most relevant.\n\nTo establish this benchmark, we first determine the received power in an empty room with randomly positioned transmitter and receiver (Fig. 1). We then repeat this process, replacing the room with a RIS (Fig. 2), and finally derive a relationship between the two.  As a valuable by-product, our formulation yields the nearfield impulse response of a RIS-assisted channel, generalizing existing far-field results [7, 8] and paralleling the derivation in [6].  This nearfield impulse response may be of independent interest."}
{"text": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve state-of-the-art performance when train and test sets share the same distribution. However, domain shift—the change in data distribution between training (source domain) and testing (target domain) sets—significantly deteriorates generalizability [1, 2]. This issue is particularly pronounced in multi-center medical studies, where varying scanners, protocols, and patient populations across imaging centers contribute to this shift [2, 3].\n\nUnsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) [1, 2] aims to generalize large-scale models pre-trained on the source domain to an unlabeled target domain, eliminating the need for costly annotation.  This is typically achieved through fine-tuning, where a source-trained model is adapted to the target domain. However, fine-tuning creates a dedicated model for each target domain, replicating the parameter count of the original pre-trained model [4, 5].  Consequently, multiple target domains require multiple dedicated models, each with the same substantial parameter footprint.\n\nWhile UDA methods can be effective for single-target domain adaptation, resulting in a single model for a specific target domain, multi-target domain adaptation (MTDA) aims to adapt to multiple unlabeled target domains simultaneously. MTDA offers broader applicability to real-world scenarios. However, training separate models for each target domain, each mirroring the source model's parameter count, is impractical and computationally expensive.\n\nParameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has proven effective for Large Language Models (LLMs) [6]. Unlike conventional fine-tuning, PEFT freezes most model parameters while adapting a significantly smaller subset, often less than 5% of the total. This enables efficient learning and faster updates. PEFT can also outperform full fine-tuning and improve generalization, especially in low-data scenarios [6].\n\nIn medical imaging, few methods have employed adapter-based PEFT in Transformer-based architectures [7, 8]. These works focus on parameter-efficient transfer learning from natural to medical images. To our knowledge, neither the application of PEFT for UDA in medical imaging nor the use of adapter-based methods in CNNs has been explored [9].\n\nAddressing this gap, we propose a novel parameter-efficient MTDA method for medical image segmentation that is both computationally and memory efficient. First, we introduce Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (ConvLoRA), adapting Low-Rank Domain Adaptation (LoRA) from LLMs [4] for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).  ConvLoRA addresses domain adaptation challenges specific to image data. Instead of creating multiple dedicated fine-tuned models, each replicating the base model's parameters, we inject several ConvLoRA adapters into the source-trained base model. Only the ConvLoRA parameters are adapted, while all other parameters remain frozen."}

While I hope this future arrives sooner rather than later, predicting the exact timeline remains uncertain.\n\nBeyond simply imagining this future, I actively support it. An era of autonomous vehicles promises a significant increase in road safety.  Free from human error, these cars wouldn't make the mistakes we're prone to, whether due to slick roads, alcohol, or peer pressure.  The primary concern I can foresee lies in potential software glitches, a risk that can be mitigated through regular maintenance.  The article suggests these cars could use half the fuel of current taxis and offer greater flexibility than buses. While I don't envision driverless cars replacing public transport entirely, I agree with the potential for increased options and a reduction in pollution.\n\nUltimately, I fully endorse the adoption of driverless cars, regardless of their primary application.  Given the low tolerance for errors in today's technology, I believe accidents caused by vehicle malfunction will be extremely rare.  The article raises the question of liability in the event of a technology failure resulting in injury.  However, it also provides a counterpoint – automakers are proceeding with development under the assumption that these challenges will be overcome, a position I strongly support.  With proper development and oversight, the benefits of driverless technology far outweigh the potential risks."}

{"text": "Consider a device *d* accessible only early in its lifespan.  This limited access may be due to physical inaccessibility (e.g., a satellite), infrequent accessibility (e.g., devices on ships), embedded location (e.g., within airplanes), or widespread distribution (e.g., across the electric power grid).  The challenge of Assured Remote Execution asks: can we deliver messages exclusively to specific, known processes running on *d* long after its initial deployment?  Can we be certain that received messages originate from specific, known processes on *d*?  Crucially, can these processes execute code written and delivered long after *d*'s initialization? We identify these known processes by the hash of their executable code.\n\nAssured remote execution necessitates hardware support [16] and cryptography to protect in-transit messages and authenticate both device *d* and the active process within *d*. Effective solutions should:\n\n1. Employ a simple hardware basis.\n2. Rely solely on simple, efficient, and well-understood cryptographic primitives.\n3. Guarantee assured remote execution even against a powerful adversary capable of running arbitrary software on *d* or modifying existing software, including the hypervisor and boot software.\n4. Provide a verification strategy, encompassing the assured remote execution protocols.\n\nWe propose a hardware basis, *caif* (Cryptographically Assured Information Flow), adapted from existing Trusted Execution Environments.  *caif* leverages cryptography to satisfy an ideal functionality defined by the information flow between processes local to *d*.  This basis utilizes only key derivation functions, message authentication codes (MACs), and authenticated symmetric encryption, fulfilling criteria 1 and 2 by employing a small set of well-understood primitives.\n\nOur design assumes a mixed software environment on *d*, where some processes execute vetted, trustworthy code, while others may run questionable or even malicious code.  We do not presume protected executable storage within a *caif* device, addressing criterion 3.  Thus, *caif* can assist an operating system in preventing malicious execution, even if an adversary modifies programs on the filesystem.\n\nWe formalize *caif* by defining an ideal functionality [17, 10] and proving lemmas demonstrating its enforcement of the intended information flow.  We then introduce a concrete cryptographic *caif* mechanism and use standard cryptographic proof techniques to show that *caif* simulates the ideal functionality (and thus satisfies the same lemmas) except with negligible probability (Corollary 1).\n\nBuilding upon the *caif* mechanism, we demonstrate how to achieve assured remote execution."}
{"text": "Generating natural and expressive motions for humanoid robots is a growing area of interest in both robotics and computer graphics [1]-[5]. This interest is fueled by the increasing presence of human-like robots in our daily lives, from interactive services to educational roles.  However, creating these natural motions often requires animators and artists to painstakingly design time-stamped movements.\n\nOne alternative is motion retargeting, which leverages existing motion capture or animation data.  Traditional motion retargeting involves manually mapping the movements between two different morphologies (e.g., a human actor and a robot). This requires designing or optimizing the source pose and then finding its corresponding target pose, considering kinematic constraints.  This manual mapping is labor-intensive, demanding significant effort and domain expertise.\n\nData-driven motion retargeting offers a solution by using machine learning [2]. These methods offer flexibility and scalability, reducing the need for extensive domain knowledge and tedious tuning.  Additionally, they require less computation during execution as they avoid iterative optimization. However, they require a substantial amount of training data and ensuring the feasibility (e.g., safety) of the generated motions can be challenging.\n\nThis paper introduces S³LE (Self-Supervised Shared Latent Embedding), a data-driven motion retargeting method that generates natural humanoid robot motions from motion capture data or RGB videos.  S³LE uses self-supervised learning in two key ways: 1) generating paired data for motion retargeting without relying on human motion data, and 2) learning a projection-invariant mapping to handle the differing expressivity of humans and robots.  This data generation process reduces the need for large datasets of paired human and robot movements and allows the retargeting algorithm to operate beyond the confines of the initial motion capture data.  The projection-invariant mapping, from an arbitrary human skeleton to a motion-retargetable skeleton, addresses the limitations in robot pose ranges compared to humans. By integrating the motion retargeting method from [6], which guarantees feasibility, S³LE performs online motion retargeting with safety guarantees (e.g., self-collision avoidance) under mild assumptions.\n\n\n† Sungjoon Choi is with School of Artificial Intelligence, Korea University, Seoul, Korea sungjoon-choi@korea.ac.kr.\n‡ Min Jae Song is with Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, New York, NY, USA minjae.song@nyu.edu.\n§ Hyemin Ahn is with Chair of Human-centered Assistive Robotics, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany hyemin.ahn@tum.de."}
{"text": "**Big Health's Daylight App Proven Effective for Generalized Anxiety Disorder in Randomized Controlled Trial**\n\n**SAN FRANCISCO & LONDON – July 29, 2020 –** Big Health, the global leader in digital therapeutics for mental health, and the University of Oxford's Sleep Circadian Neuroscience Institute today announced the publication of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in the journal *Depression and Anxiety*.  The study demonstrates the efficacy and safety of Big Health's Daylight app in improving symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).\n\nThe fully automated smartphone-based program leverages evidence-based cognitive and behavioral techniques to help users manage worry and anxiety.  Trial results revealed that Daylight significantly reduced anxiety symptoms compared to the control group after six weeks.  Impressively, 71% of Daylight users achieved remission of GAD by week 10, compared to just 33% in the control group.  These improvements were maintained even at the 26-week (uncontrolled) follow-up, which coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic – a period of heightened anxiety globally.\n\n\"This trial confirms that Daylight is a safe, effective first-line digital therapeutic for worry and anxiety,\" said Professor Jasper Smits, PhD, Department of Psychiatry at the University of Texas, Austin.  \"The consistent and measurable improvements in mental health observed in Daylight users are significant and meaningful, demonstrating the potential of this software to offer relief to those suffering from worry, anxiety, and related conditions.\"\n\nAnxiety is the most prevalent mental health issue in the United States, affecting over 40 million adults annually.  GAD, characterized by excessive and difficult-to-control worry accompanied by physical symptoms and functional impairment, affects 5-6% of the population in the UK and US, respectively. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated these challenges, with numerous surveys reporting increased rates of anxiety and stress.\n\n\"Anxiety and other mental health challenges cause immense distress globally, yet access to effective solutions remains limited due to stigma and the constraints of in-person care, further compounded by the pandemic,\" explained Dr. Jenna Carl, vice president of clinical development and medical affairs at Big Health. \"These study results confirm Daylight's meaningful impact and its potential to support millions in achieving better mental health, particularly those with limited access to traditional care.\"\n\nThe trial involved 256 participants randomized to either the Daylight intervention or a control group (who received the intervention later).  Participants met criteria for GAD with moderate to severe symptoms, assessed using established clinical measures (MINI and SCID for diagnosis; GAD-7 for severity). Assessments occurred at baseline, mid-intervention (week 3), post-intervention (week 6, primary endpoint), follow-up (week 10), and long-term follow-up (week 26).\n\nIn addition to quantitative results, qualitative feedback from participants was positive, highlighting the app's engaging design, soothing voice guidance, practical tools, and overall effectiveness in managing anxiety.  Participants reported feeling more in control, better equipped to challenge negative thoughts, and more confident in their ability to handle anxiety.\n\nBeyond the primary outcomes on anxiety, the study also found statistically significant improvements in worry, depressive symptoms, sleep difficulty, wellbeing, and quality of life.  The effects of Daylight were consistent across demographic groups and severity levels.\n\nDaylight was developed in collaboration with anxiety experts from Boston University, UCLA, University of Oxford, and the University of Texas at Austin.  The program combines animation, developed by veterans of Pixar and Radiolab, with a calming human voice to create an immersive and personalized experience.  Daylight is Big Health's second digital therapeutic, following the success of Sleepio, its digital sleep improvement program.  Daylight has received CE mark approval, signifying its compliance with EU medical device safety and performance requirements.\n\n*(The remainder of the text about Big Health, the University of Oxford, the Sleep Circadian Neuroscience Institute, the study authors, global smartphone usage, the disclaimer, and contact information can follow here.

{"text": "Neurostimulation technologies have demonstrated promising initial success over the past two decades in treating neurological disorders like drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) and Parkinson's disease (PD), as well as psychological conditions like depression (Lin and Wang, 2017; Ben-Menachem, 2012; Marangell et al., 2007).  Brain stimulation is also increasingly utilized for mapping the functional properties of various brain regions (Mandonnet et al., 2010) and enhancing sensory-motor activity (Jones et al., 2015; Toth et al., 2021).\n\nWhile the literature establishes the potency of external electromagnetic stimulation and explores neuromodulation under varying input conditions, clinical delivery has largely remained open-loop and expert-driven. This often involves constant stimulation over extended periods (sometimes months).  Such open-loop approaches are associated with inconsistent responses and suboptimal modulation, likely due to the brain's sensitivity to stimulation parameters (Deeb et al., 2016).  Closed-loop control, exemplified by the RNS® system from NeuroPace, Inc. (Skarpaas et al., 2019), offers a potential solution. However, most closed-loop implementations focus on ON-OFF control based on medically-derived biomarkers (e.g., signal line length, frequency band power, or tremor onset) rather than predictive evaluations of brain response.  This, coupled with the limited efficacy of current controllers (e.g., only 20% of individuals achieve complete seizure abatement with the RNS® system [Ramirez-Zamora et al., 2018]) and the need for energy-efficient systems, necessitates fully closed-loop control for stimulation tuning.\n\nA significant hurdle in developing fully closed-loop controllers is the brain's mechanistic complexity and modeling its response to various stimulation modalities. Despite the growing importance of neurostimulation and rapid advancements in brain activity monitoring (e.g., fMRI, iEEG), the precise mechanism of neurostimulation's interaction with the brain connectome remains poorly understood.\n\nThis review examines methods employed to understand brain responses to five common neurostimulation techniques: deep brain stimulation (DBS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), direct electric stimulation (DES), transcranial electric stimulation (tES), and optogenetic stimulation.  Existing reviews primarily focus on the efficacy of these methods for treating conditions like PD, depression, or epilepsy, with less emphasis on brain modeling approaches (De Raedt et al., 2015; Kassiri et al., 2017; Magis and Schoenen, 2012; Starnes et al., 2019; Schoenen et al., 2016).  Some reviews address specific stimulation mechanisms (Montagni et al., 2019; Chervyakov et al., 2015) based on underlying neuroscience and biomarker usage for adaptive stimulation (Bouthour et al., 2019). Lozano et al. (2019) and Herrington et al. (2016) compile various neural mechanisms (e.g., thalamic neuron inhibition) explaining DBS responses to different disorders. However, to our knowledge, no review comprehensively compiles works on modeling brain responses across various neurostimulation techniques, motivating this present effort.\n\nWe categorize computational modeling studies of these neurostimulation methods into three approaches:\n\n1. **Biophysically-derived models:** These utilize electric field equations and/or neuron models to simulate the interaction between stimulation and the brain. Parameterized by factors like tissue conductivity and geometry, these models are tuned to replicate observed data and used to optimize stimulation parameters (e.g., location and intensity).\n\n2. **Stimulus-response models:** These employ statistical and machine learning tools (e.g., correlation, hypothesis testing, artificial neural networks) to model the overall stimulus-response profile. Data-driven in nature, these models generally don't capture the temporal dynamics of brain response.\n\n3. **Dynamical system models:** These learn the impact of neurostimulation on brain network dynamics using observed input-output time series data. Primarily data-driven, these methods typically avoid biophysical assumptions. (We acknowledge that some biophysical models incorporate dynamical system components.)\n\n(Figure 2: Year-wise spread…)  Figure 2 illustrates the year-wise distribution of the reviewed literature across these three approaches. While biophysical and stimulus-response models have a longer history, data-driven dynamical systems modeling has increased markedly in recent years.  This figure compares categories, not absolute historical frequency, as the latter requires a historically uniform literature synthesis.\n\nThe following section provides an itemized review of the existing literature for each neurostimulation technology and methodological category (see Figure 1). While biophysical and stimulus-response models have longer histories and more studies across technologies (Figures 1 and 2), we emphasize dynamical systems models due to their applicability to therapeutic control design (summarized in Figure 3).  We also review key studies in the biophysical and stimulus-response categories to provide historical context.  Finally, we examine modeling efforts in the context of commonly studied brain disorders to facilitate focused analysis of disease-specific literature.\n\n*Review Criteria:*  We primarily used keyword searches on Google Scholar (e.g., \"{stimulation}+{approach}+{specific model}\").  Given the larger volume of literature for biophysical and stimulus-response models, we prioritized highly cited and recent works for inclusion, while also considering methodologically novel or significant findings in less cited works.  While not exhaustive, this review aims to provide a broad overview of prevailing methods for modeling brain dynamics in response to neurostimulation.  In cases where…"}

{"text": "Emotion-recognition technology holds significant potential for both educators and parents.  It can provide valuable insights into a child's emotional state, helping identify whether specific situations or individuals trigger happiness, anger, disgust, or fear.  Implementing this technology in schools eliminates the financial burden on parents who might not otherwise have access to such resources.\n\nThis technology can be particularly helpful in addressing bullying.  If a student is being bullied, educators can use emotion recognition software to facilitate communication and identify the perpetrator. By showing the student pictures of potential bullies, teachers can observe facial expressions that might indicate fear or anxiety, providing valuable clues about the bullying dynamic.\n\nFurthermore, this technology can be used to support struggling students. If a student is experiencing academic difficulties or exhibiting withdrawn behavior, educators can utilize emotion recognition to explore potential underlying issues. By involving parents in the process and observing the student's emotional responses to various stimuli, teachers can initiate conversations about potential stressors at home or school, fostering a more supportive and understanding environment.\n\nThese examples illustrate how emotion-recognition technology can be a powerful tool for teachers and parents to gain a deeper understanding of their students and children, particularly those who may be reluctant to verbalize their feelings.  Providing access to this technology in schools ensures equitable access for all families, regardless of their financial situation, and offers a valuable resource for addressing sensitive issues affecting student well-being."}

{"text": "Regular languages can be represented in a multitude of equivalent forms, including finite automata, finite monoids, regular expressions, and formulas of monadic second-order logic.  Often, the most concise representation uses a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA).  Consequently, the study of state-minimal NFAs is of significant computational and mathematical interest.\n\nHowever, minimizing an NFA, or even deciding if one is minimal, is a surprisingly complex PSPACE-complete problem [ ]. This complexity stems from the lack of structure in minimal NFAs: a language may have many non-isomorphic minimal NFA acceptors without easily identifiable properties distinguishing them from non-minimal ones.  This necessitates exhaustive search in all known minimization algorithms (and related procedures like inclusion or universality testing) [ , , ].  This contrasts sharply with deterministic finite automata (DFAs), where a universal property ensures uniqueness up to isomorphism, leading to efficient minimization.\n\nThis paper aims to introduce more structure to the theory of nondeterministic state minimality. We propose a novel algebraic perspective on NFAs based on boolean representations of monoids, specifically morphisms M → JSL(S, S) from a monoid M into the endomorphism monoid of a finite join-semilattice S. We focus on quotient monoids of the free monoid Σ* recognizing a given regular language L ⊆ Σ*.  The largest such monoid is Σ* itself, and the smallest is the syntactic monoid syn(L).  For both, L induces a canonical boolean representation on the semilattice SLD(L) of all finite unions of left derivatives of L: Σ* → JSL(SLD(L), SLD(L)) and syn(L) → JSL(SLD(L), SLD(L)).\n\nThe first representation yields an algebraic characterization of minimal NFAs:\n\n**Theorem:** The size of a state-minimal NFA for L equals the least degree of any extension of the canonical representation of Σ* induced by L.\n\nHere, the degree of a representation is the number of join-irreducibles of the underlying semilattice.  This result naturally leads to the question of an analogous automata-theoretic perspective on the canonical representation of syn(L) and its extensions.  To this end, we introduce *subatomic* NFAs, generalizing the atomic NFAs of Brzozowski and Tamm [ ].\n\nTo analyze subatomic NFAs, we employ an algebraic framework interpreting NFAs in terms of JSL-DFAs, deterministic finite automata in the category of semilattices.  In this setting, SLD(L) naturally arises as the minimal JSL-DFA for L.  We will show that much of the structure theory of (sub-)atomic NFAs reduces to the self-duality of the category of JSL-DFAs. Our main result characterizes minimal subatomic NFAs:\n\n**Theorem:** The size of a state-minimal subatomic NFA for L equals the least degree of any extension of the canonical representation of syn(L).\n\nWe call this measure the *nondeterministic syntactic complexity* of L.  As illustrated in Section [section number missing], this measure is remarkably natural: existing work on the structure of state-minimal NFAs implicitly identifies language classes where nondeterministic state complexity equals nondeterministic syntactic complexity, effectively focusing on minimal subatomic acceptors."}

{"text": "Driverless cars offer a promising future, though some may have reservations. While individual opinions vary, the potential benefits of this technology are compelling.\n\nOne of the most significant advantages is enhanced safety.  As the article highlights, these cars have already driven over half a million miles without incident. This impressive track record suggests that driverless technology could drastically reduce the number of car crashes each year.  Furthermore, the car itself is designed with safety as a priority. Equipped with sensors that \"sense the world\" around them, these vehicles can react faster and more efficiently than a human driver.  These sensors, which the article notes are not a new technology, allow the car to independently apply brakes to individual wheels and reduce engine power, responding to potential hazards with a precision unmatched by human capability. This protects not only the driver but also the vehicle itself.  The built-in safety mechanisms, such as the touch sensors that ensure driver engagement when necessary, further mitigate risk.  The alert system reminds drivers when they need to take control, adding another layer of security.\n\nWhile some may harbor concerns about unforeseen issues, the potential positive impact outweighs the hypothetical negatives.  The desire for safer vehicles is widespread, and driverless technology directly addresses this need.  Specifically, this technology offers a solution to the pervasive problem of distracted driving, particularly texting while driving.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe driverless cars represent a significant advancement."}

{"text": "In LAPACK, the routines `S/D/CS/ZD`RSCL scale a complex vector *x* by the reciprocal of a real number *a*.  This is functionally equivalent to the following code:\n\n```\ndo i = 1, n\n  x(i) = x(i) / a\nend do\n```\n\nHowever, the RSCL routines incorporate two key optimizations:\n\n1. They leverage the BLAS routine SCAL to perform the scaling by the reciprocal of *a*. This utilizes only one division and *n* multiplications, compared to the *n* divisions in the code snippet above.\n\n2. The operation (1/*a*) * *x*<sub>i</sub> can overflow or underflow in finite precision, even when *x*<sub>i</sub> / *a* does not.  Therefore, the RSCL routines also check the range of *a* and, if necessary, scale *x* by a power of two. This may incur an additional *n* multiplications by a power of two, depending on the value of *a*.\n\nConsequently, the RSCL routines are generally faster than the naive code. However, the simpler code is often more accurate due to its reduced number of floating-point operations.  This performance gain is particularly pronounced when *x* is complex, as complex division is more computationally expensive than complex multiplication (except in the trivial case where the denominator has a zero real or imaginary part).  Furthermore, the accuracy loss in the complex case can be negligible, because computing a complex division inherently involves a complex multiplication of the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator.\n\nSome LAPACK routines, such as CLARFG and CGETF2, require reciprocal scaling where both *a* and *x* are complex."}
{"text": "Smart Cars: A Positive Step Towards Driverless Technology\n\nThe development of Smart Cars raises the question of their impact on the future of driverless vehicles.  While concerns exist regarding liability in the event of technological failures – is the driver or manufacturer responsible? – the benefits of Smart Car technology suggest a positive contribution to the evolution of autonomous driving.  These vehicles, equipped with advanced sensors, limited autonomous capabilities, and driver-alert systems, offer significant safety and convenience advantages.\n\nOne key advantage of Smart Cars lies in their sophisticated sensor systems. These sensors constantly monitor the vehicle's surroundings, contributing to features like anti-lock brakes, skid control, and rollover prevention. As noted in a recent article, \"auto makers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes. Within 10 years, those sensors have become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers.\"  These sensors are strategically placed throughout the vehicle – on wheels, the roof, and using radar – to provide a comprehensive view of the environment.\n\nFurthermore, Smart Cars possess the ability to handle certain driving functions at speeds up to 25 miles per hour. While not fully autonomous, this feature allows the car to steer, accelerate, and brake within specific parameters.  As an article explains, \"They can steer, accelerate, and break themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.\"  This limited autonomy eases the burden on the driver while still requiring human oversight.  Importantly, safety mechanisms, like touch sensors on the steering wheel, ensure driver engagement and prevent complete disengagement from the driving process. The driver remains essential for maneuvers like parking and intervention in complex situations. \"But special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. In fact, none of the cars developed so far [are] completely driverless.\""}

First, the limited resolution of cameras at the time, with pixels as large as 43 meters (compared to 1.56 meters today), could easily distort shapes and create illusions. This low resolution, combined with the angle of the camera and the direction of the light source, could significantly alter the appearance of shadows, potentially creating the impression of a human head.  Weather conditions at the time of the photograph, such as cloud cover, could also contribute to this effect.\n\nFurthermore, the angle of the sunlight and the resulting shadows play a crucial role in how we perceive shapes.

{"text": "Autonomous driving systems promise to revolutionize transportation by enhancing safety, efficiency, and convenience.  A key challenge is developing robust car-following capabilities—mimicking the seemingly simple yet intricate task of following a lead vehicle (Figure 1). This complexity stems from the need to adapt to dynamic traffic conditions and the diverse behaviors of leading vehicles.  Generally, car-following models for autonomous vehicles fall into two categories: stimulus-response-based and learning-based.\n\nMost stimulus-response-based models operate under the assumption that the following vehicle (follower) actively reacts to changes in environmental states (e.g., the leader's speed and position) as stimuli.  Examples include Newell's model [1], the optimal velocity model [2], and the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) [3]. These models, incorporating prior knowledge, require minimal calibration data [4, 5]. However, their reliance on the stimulus-response assumption means the follower's reaction is highly sensitive to the leader's instantaneous actions.  Real-world driving experience demonstrates that follower responses are scenario-dependent: drivers react strongly in interactive scenarios but weakly in non-interactive ones.  Consequently, these stimulus-response-based models may struggle to capture the nuances of diverse traffic environments.\n\nLearning-based models, trained on large datasets, aim to capture driving behaviors across a wider range of scenarios. Examples include Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) [6], deep neural networks [7], and deep reinforcement learning [8]."}
{"text": "Humanity, fleeing a dying Earth, embarked on a perilous journey through the void. Most colony ships succumbed to the unforgiving expanse, their inhabitants freezing as life support failed.  Six vessels, however, guided by a beacon of hope, limped towards a super-earth, christened *Colossus* – a world akin to old Venus.  This new home boasted a rich aerial ecosystem, and the failing ships were repurposed into three floating islands, suspended in the dense atmosphere. Gravity and oxygen were near-perfect, but the sheer size of Colossus, fifteen times that of Earth, combined with the lack of an ionosphere or satellites, rendered communication between the islands impossible.  Isolated, their cultures and races diverged, the rare conjunctions of the islands offering fleeting moments of exchange that over millennia became increasingly inconsequential.\n\nTwo thousand years passed before the continents of Europa and Titan, named for celestial bodies of a bygone era, met once more. Europa was a verdant tapestry of genetically modified flora and fauna, its crystalline lakes mirroring the jade sky. Settlements, seemingly grown from the landscape itself, dotted the rolling hills. Titan, in stark contrast, was a metal behemoth, its steel and glass towers spewing black smog into the atmosphere.  A cascade of refuse tumbled from its edges as it approached Europa, leaving a wake of filth.  The Europans, a peaceful people, watched in horror, powerless to prevent the impending rendezvous.\n\nThe Titanians, pale, weak, and plagued by congenital illnesses, wasted no time in pouring from their overcrowded city onto Europa’s unspoiled shores.  Their culture, one of technological advancement through environmental subjugation, stood in stark contrast to the Europans’ harmonious existence.  The Europans, their green skin and prehensile toes adapted to an arboreal life, fled inland, gathering in conclave. Titan, a festering wound on Colossus, was now poised to infect Europa.  As the Titanians advanced, despoiling the land, the Europans faced a stark choice: fight or perish.  Massive umbilical cables, deployed from Titan, prevented the continents from separating, a grim reminder of the dwindling time.\n\nThree millennia later, the inhabitants of Umbriel, the third continent, witnessed a long-awaited conjunction.  A massive landmass, twice the size of their own, drifted into view. Half the continent bore the ruins of a megacity, reclaimed by nature; the other, a paradise of green hills, lakes, and villages. As Umbriel drew closer, a smoky plume emerged from the ruins, growing denser and darker, spiraling upwards before descending upon Umbriel.\n\nA Europan survey team later picked through the flensed bones that littered the Umbrish cities.  The genetically modified locust cloud, their gruesome task complete, returned to the ruins of Titan. As the islands converged, massive roots bridged the gap, merging them into a supercontinent.  The Europans, having orchestrated this horrific act of biological warfare, were finally safe."}
{"text": "The prospect of driverless cars, while technologically intriguing, raises serious concerns about safety, economic impact, and the loss of a cherished rite of passage.  Learning to drive is a formative experience, creating lasting memories of mishaps, bonding with instructors, and the motivation to excel in school and save for that first car.  Ask anyone, and they can recount the details of their driving lessons as if it were yesterday. Driverless cars threaten to erase this significant milestone.\n\nThe excitement of getting behind the wheel, the freedom of the open road, and the social bonding with friends are all integral parts of the teenage experience.  Driverless cars eliminate the joy of driving, reducing it to a mere automated function. What's the thrill of sitting passively while a machine takes control?\n\nMoreover, the safety implications are alarming. Even with attentive drivers, millions die in car crashes yearly.  Introducing driverless cars, with the potential for driver complacency and inattention, could drastically increase these numbers. Human nature dictates that comfort levels rise with automated tasks.  Thousands of unalert and overly comfortable drivers on the road is a recipe for disaster.\n\nThe economic consequences are equally dire.  Millions of teenagers learn to drive through driver's education programs, a multi-million dollar industry that would be decimated by driverless cars.  Thousands of driving instructors would lose their jobs.\n\nFinally, the elimination of driving lessons undermines a crucial learning experience. Mastering a vehicle instills responsibility, teaches spatial awareness and quick decision-making, and builds confidence.  These skills extend beyond driving and are valuable life lessons.\n\nIn conclusion, the development of driverless cars, while potentially beneficial to the manufacturers, poses significant risks."}
{"text": "Driverless cars present significant challenges that warrant their exclusion from public roads.  The core argument for autonomous vehicles is their potential to liberate drivers from constant attention. However, this premise is inherently flawed.  As highlighted in the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming,\" unforeseen circumstances like road construction, traffic congestion, or accidents necessitate an alert driver ready to take control.  This requirement negates the supposed advantage of driverless technology and introduces a dangerous scenario: a driver lulled into a false sense of security, ill-prepared to react swiftly when human intervention becomes critical. Such inattention could easily lead to serious accidents.\n\nFurthermore, the issue of liability remains unresolved.  While manufacturers strive to perfect the technology, the current legal framework places responsibility on the driver in case of an accident.  This is underscored by the fact that, as mentioned, many states currently prohibit the testing of computer-driven cars based on the principle that human drivers are essential for safety.  This reluctance to shift liability highlights the inherent uncertainties surrounding autonomous vehicle technology.\n\nFinally, the substantial investment required to overcome these technological and legal hurdles raises questions about the practicality of pursuing driverless cars.  Even with ongoing development, significant doubts remain about the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of this technology."}

That was the first thing I ever teased you about.  Actually, if you remember, that was the first thing I ever said to you: “Rain boots are kind of an odd accessory to your outfit.”\n\nYour laugh matched your easy smile. You nodded, conceding the point, then asked how my feet were faring, knowing full well my black flats were flooded.\n\nThat was the first time we met. We both skipped the next bus and haven't looked back since.  I look back on that day and thank God for lost keys, for oversleeping, and even for that poop-producing machine, Bigglesworth.\n\nI love you, and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you."}

He’d sworn to maintain his old friend’s lawn when he accepted the near-constant surveillance that came with being President of the United States.  A trifle to some in this age, but a significant sacrifice for a freedom-loving man from the mountains. Loyalty to his friend and pride in his work had sustained him, but now, he barely registered the procession of giant insects solemnly marching toward the White House. He had failed.\n\nResistance was futile. Arnold, the chief of security, had already lost two men trying to halt the aliens' inexorable advance.  Ignoring them meant survival; interference meant incineration.  A burnt hair smell lingered in the halls. Their target was clearly the President. They had initially advanced on the Oval Office, but when the President was evacuated, they altered their course, relentlessly pursuing him. Escape by air or ground was impossible; any approaching vehicle was instantly destroyed by the alien landing craft. Both the invaders and their ship seemed impervious to attack.\n\nPresident Reed, a kind and honorable man, remained calm. When a frantic Arnold rushed to him, struggling to articulate the inevitable—\"I can't stop them\"—Reed quietly shushed him.\n\n\"They want me,\" he said. \"If I go, they may leave the rest of you in peace.\"  He started walking toward the aliens, who had just rounded a corner in the bunker and entered the long escape tunnel.\n\n\"Sir, at least leave your cat,\" Arnold pleaded.\n\n\"Mittens has been my companion throughout my presidency,\" Reed replied, \"and I shall certainly want him wherever I go.\"\n\nPresident Reed, to the perpetual dismay of his more formal staff, insisted on keeping his cat with him at all times.  Mittens, a regally purring ball of white fluff, nestled in his arms.\n\nAt the President’s command, his staff remained behind.  Reed approached the aliens at the same pace they approached him, his face devoid of fear.\n\nWhen they were about a meter apart, both parties stopped.  Five aliens stood before him: one in front, and four behind in double file. The lead alien carried a golden box with red hinges in two of its small arms. It reached forward, opened the box—\n\nAnd revealed a beautiful salmon fillet and a generous helping of catnip."}

{"text": "Motion blur, typically an unwanted artifact in photography, has been the subject of extensive research focusing on recovering sharp details.  Recent efforts have shifted towards the more complex challenge of reconstructing high-frame-rate sharp videos from blurred images, a task variously termed joint deblurring and interpolation, blur temporal super-resolution, or—for brevity in this paper—blur interpolation.  This technology has broad applications, including video enhancement, slow-motion generation, and analysis of fast-moving objects.\n\nWhile recent studies demonstrate the superiority of joint approaches over cascaded deblurring and interpolation methods, most existing solutions operate within a center-frame interpolation pipeline, limiting their ability to generate latent frames beyond middle moments.  Though DeMFI [28] overcomes this limitation by combining feature-flow and pixel-flow-based warping, overall performance, even on synthetic data, remains suboptimal. We identify the underutilization of temporal correlations within blur as a key factor hindering progress, alongside the lack of a real-world dataset for training and evaluation, which leads to generalization issues.\n\nThis work addresses these two limitations. We introduce a novel transformer-based model, BiT (Blur Interpolation Transformer), incorporating a multiscale residual Swin transformer block (MS-RSTB) to effectively handle multiscale blur and fuse information from adjacent frames.  Furthermore, we propose dual-end temporal supervision (DTS) and temporally symmetric ensembling (TSE) to enhance temporal feature sharing for time-varying motion reconstruction. Consequently, BiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks even without optical flow warping.\n\nTo address the lack of real-world data, we have created RBI, a novel dataset captured using a precisely calibrated hybrid camera system, inspired by [34, 55].  RBI provides time-aligned low-frame-rate blurred and high-frame-rate sharp video pairs, offering a crucial resource for training and evaluating blur interpolation models, thus mitigating the generalization problem and enabling more realistic assessment.  These advancements allow our model to achieve impressive arbitrary blur interpolation results, exemplified by the extraction of 30 sharp frames from a single blurred image (see Fig. 1).\n\nOur key contributions are:\n\n*  The development of BiT, a novel transformer-based model for blur interpolation, featuring MS-RSTB for enhanced multiscale blur handling.\n*  The introduction and validation of DTS and TSE strategies to improve temporal feature learning for accurate motion reconstruction.\n*  The creation and release of RBI, the first real-world dataset for general blur interpolation, providing a much-needed benchmark for the research community.  Extensive experiments demonstrate its validity and value."}

The article states, \"The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel... the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over.\"  This indicates that a driver still needs to grip the wheel and remain vigilant, prepared to intervene if necessary.\n\nDriverless cars pose safety risks due to potential technological malfunctions.

A simple village girl, she was overwhelmed by the urban cacophony. Rising, she looked around desperately, wondering which path would lead her home, if home even existed anymore.\n\nAs she wandered, she discovered a watch in her pocket.  The ticking was a novelty; she’d never encountered such a device.  Fascinated, she traced the second hand’s revolutions as she continued her journey.\n\nSuddenly, an old man addressed her from behind.  \"What'd ye got there, missy? Ha! Is that a clock? Haven't seen one of those in ages.  You're not from around here, are ye? From the village, maybe?\"\n\nLost and confused, Elizabeth could only shrug and shake her head.\n\n\"What do ye mean, ye don't know!? That braid! No one around here wears their hair like that, unless they're from the village! You're lost, aren't ye?\"\n\nHope flickered within Elizabeth as she nodded vigorously.\n\n\"Go straight down this road. You'll see a giant gate separating the city from the village. Get there before your clock strikes eleven, or you'll never get home!\" The man pointed to the eleven o'clock mark on her watch.  \"But remember this: you'll meet two men on your way, and one will deceive ye!

At a pedestrian crossing, she encountered a man who looked remarkably like the first.\n\n\"Why the hurry, lass? And why that clock?\" he inquired.\n\nGlancing at her watch, Elizabeth saw she had only thirty minutes left. She awkwardly smiled, pointing in the direction of the gate.\n\n\"Oh, you're from the village? Then why the rush? Put that watch down and join me for tea. We rarely get such fine ladies visiting our city.\"\n\nBlushing, Elizabeth shook her head, insisting she had to go.  Twenty-five minutes left.  She bid the man farewell and hurried on.  As she distanced herself, he called out, \"Time is precious, lady! Appreciate it while you can! Or better yet, don't mind it at all! It ruins moments and memories!\"\n\nIgnoring his words, Elizabeth broke into a run. Ten minutes.  Finally, the giant gate came into view. Relief washed over her, but in her elation, she forgot a crucial detail. She’d only met one man.\n\nStopping, she scanned her surroundings. Five minutes.  Impatient, she decided the second man couldn't be that important. Reaching the gate was paramount.  But as she stepped forward, a woman blocked her path. Panic surged. Two minutes.\n\n\"You look tense, ma'am.

{"text": "The article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" explores the potential advent of autonomous vehicles. However, the pursuit of driverless cars is unwise.  The risks of accidents involving these vehicles are substantial, potentially endangering both occupants and other road users.  Furthermore, drivers would sacrifice the independence and control that comes with operating their own vehicles.  Investing in driverless car technology fosters societal laziness rather than addressing more critical needs.\n\nThe fundamental design of a car presupposes human control.  This explains why even existing \"driverless\" cars still require a human driver.  Cars demand the nuanced control of a sentient being, not a computer. This parallels the debate surrounding robots: should emotionless machines, incapable of fully understanding human behavior, become commonplace in our homes?  Ironically, as the article mentions, manufacturers are considering cameras to monitor driver attention.  \"While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver\" (\"Driverless Cars Are Coming\").  This underscores the inherent contradiction: supposedly self-driving cars still require driver oversight.  The article itself questions the logic: \"Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?\" and \"Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?\" (\"Driverless Cars Are Coming\").  Why indeed, when that reliance could lead to dangerous situations?  It’s illogical to jeopardize one's safety and the safety of others by relying on a system that demands driver intervention when simply maintaining human control from the start eliminates that risk.  This practice, honed over centuries, remains the safest approach.\n\n\nIn conclusion, the \"driverless\" car should remain a concept, not a reality.  Its development is imprudent, posing significant safety risks.  Driverless cars are not just driverless; they are careless.  Without a human at the wheel, emotional intelligence and nuanced decision-making are absent.  Computers cannot replicate the complex judgments human drivers make in diverse and unpredictable traffic situations."}
{"text": "The prevailing AI alignment paradigm, exemplified by models like ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) and LLaMA-2-Chat (Touvron et al., 2023b), utilizes supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with prompted demonstrations (Sanh et al., 2021; Chung et al., 2022a; Zhou et al., 2023) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align large language model (LLM) outputs with human intentions (Ziegler et al., 2019; Ouyang et al., 2022).  However, obtaining high-quality human annotations, including consistent response demonstrations and in-distribution preferences, is expensive and unscalable (Touvron et al., 2023b).  Moreover, the SFT + RLHF paradigm inherently assumes that humans can always demonstrate or evaluate the tasks performed by advanced AI systems. While current models fall within human evaluative capabilities, future, more sophisticated models may undertake tasks that challenge human evaluation.  This presents a looming risk: such models might prioritize appeasing human evaluators over ensuring accuracy (Andreas, 2022; Perez et al., 2022).\n\nTo address these challenges, we aim to develop a new methodology for scalable AI oversight (Amodei et al., 2016; Bowman et al., 2022). Our vision is to define a few general principles, similar to Isaac Asimov's three laws of robotics (Asimov, 1941), which AI systems can comprehensively internalize (Gilardi et al., 2023; Ganguli et al., 2023). This aligns with recent research on self-alignment (Bai et al., 2022b; Sun et al., 2023b), which focuses on using AI models for self-improvement, for example, through bootstrapping over model-generated critiques (Madaan et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2023) or self-refined outputs (Wang et al., 2022a; Li et al., 2023a). However, these bootstrapping methods currently lag behind RLHF in performance (Bai et al., 2022b; Touvron et al., 2023b).  Meanwhile, methods like Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Constitutional AI (CAI) (Bai et al., 2022b; OpenAI, 2023a) have emerged as potential alternatives. These techniques leverage feedback from automated AI systems, reducing reliance on extensive human-annotated preferences.  So far, previous RLAIF work has primarily focused on enhancing the safety of models already trained with RLHF.  Consequently, these RLAIF methods inherit a dependence on human-annotated preferences from the RLHF warm-up stage. This leads to a pivotal research question:\n\n• Can RLAIF fully replace RLHF to align language models from scratch, enhancing both their general alignment and capabilities?\n\nThis paper answers this question affirmatively by introducing a novel approach called SALMON.\n\nCentral to our approach is an instructable reward model capable of interpreting and adhering to arbitrary human-written preference guidelines, generating reward scores based on these principles. This differs from previous RLAIF methods (Bai et al., 2022b; OpenAI, 2023a), where principles are used only to produce synthetic preferences, and model-generated scores are not explicitly conditioned on any principles, as illustrated in Figure 1. SALMON's design enables better control over the RL-trained policy model's behavior.  In conventional RLHF, iterative online collection of in-distribution preference feedback (Bai et al., 2022a; Touvron et al., 2023b) is crucial to counteract reward hacking, where model-generated reward scores do not accurately reflect model performance (Skalse et al., 2022; Pan et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2023). SALMON addresses this by explicitly defining principles to combat observed reward-hacking patterns in model outputs, such as self-praise at the end of a response.  Furthermore, SALMON can emphasize distinct aspects of alignment with respect to Helpfulness, Honesty, and Harmlessness (HHH) (Askell et al., 2021) by customizing its preference principles.  Our methodology also effectively reduces false refusals observed in certain over-aligned language models (Touvron et al., 2023b) through specific principles.\n\nOur instructable reward model can be trained with synthetic data and applied to diverse language models without model-specific human preference data (Bai et al., 2022a; Touvron et al., 2023b).  Possible policy model initialization strategies include principle-driven self-alignment (Sun et al., 2023b), supervised fine-tuning on human demonstrations (Chung et al., 2022a; Zhou et al., 2023), or even unaligned base language models (Touvron et al., 2023a)."}

{"text": "Arthur Moats, the former Pittsburgh Steeler known for his on-field ferocity—including the tackle that ended Brett Favre’s legendary 297 consecutive game streak—is not easily intimidated. Yet, the 6-foot, 240-pound linebacker admits to feeling fear when offered a one-year, veteran’s minimum “prove it” deal with the Steelers in 2014.  He wrestled with the uncertainty: Was his career over? Should he uproot his life and move from Buffalo to Pittsburgh?\n\n“A lot of people have paralysis through analysis,” Moats explains. “They overthink and allow fear to become a blocking force.” His advice?  “Use that fear as motivation. Take the chance and see what you’re able to accomplish.”  Moats confronted his fear, thrived in Pittsburgh, and earned a three-year contract after that initial season.\n\nSince retiring in 2019, he’s dedicated himself to a lifelong passion: improving lives.  His book, *Theory of Life* (Leadership League), outlines a five-point plan for better living based on the acronym M.O.A.T.S.: Make happiness a priority; Openness yields strength; Actively inspire others; Turn fear into focus; Smile, spread my inner love everywhere.\n\nThis philosophy stems from his upbringing in the Tidewater region of Virginia.  Raised by ministers, he developed a strong sense of duty to others. Recognizing that his stable childhood was an ideal not everyone experiences, Moats emphasizes the importance of adult mentorship for children in challenging circumstances. “Whether it’s an uncle or other family member,” he says, “it’s important to have someone they can look to for advice and direction.”\n\nWhile each element of M.O.A.T.S. is crucial, Moats is particularly passionate about actively inspiring others.  “Many people mistakenly believe they need wealth, success, or a platform to be inspirational,” he notes. “But inspiration is simply instilling belief in someone.  Acknowledging their efforts, offering encouragement, or empathizing with their struggles – it costs nothing.”  He believes that once people understand this simplicity, they’ll be more willing to inspire those around them.\n\nThroughout *Theory of Life*, Moats quotes inspirational figures like Hellen Keller, Rosa Parks, Booker T. Washington, Paulo Coelho, Dr. Joyce Brothers, and Lao Tzu—a diverse group notably lacking in athletes. This unconventional approach is characteristic of Moats, who has always charted his own course."}

While the cost remains a barrier to widespread consumer adoption, the underlying systems are largely in place.  Google employees have noted the effectiveness of current smart road systems, and the company believes that ongoing upgrades bring driverless cars closer to market readiness.  One key area of development is the car's starting system.  Google has leveraged existing technology like the Toyota Prius's radar sensor, GPS receivers, and inertial motion sensors, combining them to create a system that mimics human driving behavior.\n\nSafety is a paramount concern, and a major driver of the shift toward autonomous vehicles.  Google's driverless car has logged over half a million miles without an accident, a feat rarely achieved by human drivers.  The enhanced safety features, such as alerts that prompt driver intervention when necessary and motion sensors that ensure driver attentiveness, represent a significant leap forward in automotive safety.\n\nBeyond technological feasibility and safety improvements, widespread acceptance of driverless cars is crucial for their success.  The underlying technology, such as sensors and radios, is already familiar; the innovation lies in their application to enhance vehicle operation and safety.  While there are potential energy savings through the use of sensors, the primary benefits are centered around safety and convenience. I predict strong consumer demand once driverless cars become commercially available.\n\nIn conclusion, the convergence of technological advancements, enhanced safety features, and increasing global acceptance points to the inevitable rise of driverless cars.

While the city mourned the loss and supported the grieving families, many expressed gratitude that a larger catastrophe was averted in the city of nearly half a million.\n\nDespite his role in minimizing the devastation, Dr. Probability found himself handcuffed in a holding cell at Diamond City's central police station. Instead of the expected mayoral handshake at city hall, he was arrested under suspicion of orchestrating the attack.

{"text": "The Facial Action Coding System (FACS), a technology developed by Professor Thomas Huang, has the potential to revolutionize classroom learning and student support.  While researchers have long studied facial expressions, FACS utilizes advanced facial recognition to detect and interpret emotions.  This has far-reaching implications beyond the laboratory, particularly in educational settings.\n\nOne key benefit of FACS lies in its ability to personalize learning.  As Dr. Huang notes, \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored… Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\"  Currently, teachers, while bound by curriculum and time constraints, strive to address individual student needs within a classroom of fifteen to twenty students.  FACS could provide the individualized support that is often challenging for teachers to deliver consistently. By recognizing student frustration or confusion through facial cues, the system could dynamically adjust lesson pacing and complexity, ensuring that students grasp the concepts effectively. This responsiveness could prevent students from feeling overwhelmed and disengaged, ultimately fostering a more positive and productive learning environment.\n\nFurthermore, FACS could prove invaluable for school counselors. Students often struggle to articulate their emotions, especially in a counseling setting where they may feel nervous or hesitant.  FACS could provide counselors with real-time insights into a student's emotional state, even if the student is not verbally expressing those feelings.  This technology could help counselors quickly identify underlying issues such as sadness, anxiety, or fear, allowing for more targeted and effective interventions. By facilitating a deeper understanding of student needs, FACS could significantly enhance the role of counselors in supporting student well-being.\n\nFACS could also bridge communication gaps between teachers and students, particularly those who are less verbally expressive or have communication challenges.  As Dr. Huang points out, \"Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication.\""}
{"text": "Optical aberration is a common degradation in real lens-based imaging systems.  Because simple lenses deviate from the ideal thin-lens model, they suffer from chromatic, spherical, and coma aberrations, significantly degrading image quality.  To counteract these artifacts, modern camera lenses typically comprise a complex combination of numerous lens elements (sometimes dozens) with carefully designed parameters (the lens prescription).  In essence, existing techniques achieve high image quality through this complex design, at the cost of increased expense, weight, and inevitable lens flare. With the rapid development of high-pixel-count digital sensors (e.g., 100 megapixels), effective compensation for lens aberration is crucial.\n\nTo achieve lightweight, low-cost, high-quality imaging, computational optical aberration correction has been explored for decades. Unlike advanced optical design, computational methods employ a simple lens for imaging and algorithmically remove the aberration afterward. Mathematically, lens aberration can be formulated as convolution with spatially varying kernels, and compensation is achieved through deconvolution, aided by image priors. These computational methods can be non-blind or blind, depending on whether the aberration model, i.e., the Point Spread Function (PSF), is calibrated beforehand. Non-blind methods measure the PSF using specialized systems [26, 7, 11] or estimate it from degraded images using specific algorithms [23, 30, 28], followed by deconvolution. Blind methods typically estimate the PSF and the latent sharp image jointly in an iterative manner [35].  Given that the PSF is fixed for a given lens and PSF estimation has been extensively studied, this paper focuses on the non-blind case.\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 1(b), the PSF resulting from lens aberration is spatially non-uniform and varies across color channels.  Researchers have proposed various algorithms for non-uniform deconvolution, including pixel-wise deconvolution [6, 33, 5] and patch-wise deconvolution [7, 23, 36, 8]. The latter assumes that the PSF varies smoothly spatially and can be approximated as locally uniform. Deconvolution in this case is usually faster than pixel-wise methods. This assumption also holds for the PSF caused by aberration in a low-end lens.\n\nRecently, deep neural networks have shown promising results for image deconvolution [27, 3]. However, handling non-uniformity remains challenging for end-to-end deep learning. Using a single network weight setting for different sub-regions with different PSFs either requires substantial model capacity or results in average performance. Training separate models for each sub-region is time-consuming. This paper proposes combining deep networks and model-based deconvolution in an iterative framework. Prior-guided deconvolution is performed locally and explicitly models the physical degradation process, ensuring high fidelity and easy adaptation to different lenses. A single global deep projection network is applied to the entire image to suppress ringing and blocking artifacts.  Furthermore, we propose pre-training a base model on a large dataset of diverse lenses and then quickly adapting it to a specific lens, significantly simplifying the training process.\n\nThe main contributions of this paper are:\n\n* We propose a PSF-aware deep network to address spatially varying degradation caused by lens aberration by decoupling the physical imaging model and deep network prior.\n* Model training utilizes a pre-trained base model and a fast adaptation procedure for different lenses, ensuring efficiency and feasibility.\n* The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly higher running efficiency.\n\nWe conduct synthetic and qualitative experiments to demonstrate the training efficiency and performance of our method.  We also obtain promising results on real data captured by low-end lenses, as shown in Figure 1 and further illustrated in Figure 9."}

{"text": "Since the 1980s, research has demonstrated the feasibility of substantially reducing parameters in neural networks without significantly compromising performance [16, 31].  Pruned neural networks, using specific methods [8, 14], can significantly decrease the computational demands of inference. Among various pruning methods, Network Pruning at Initialization (PaI) has garnered considerable attention for its potential to train sparse networks at lower costs [38].  Specifically, PaI aims to achieve accuracy comparable to a dense network by training a sparse subnetwork initialized from a randomly initialized dense network.\n\nWithin PaI research, the pruning criterion is a key focus [11, 21, 26, 28, 29, 35, 38]. Most PaI methods employ iterative pruning processes to improve performance, but this drastically increases training costs.  In contrast, One-shot Network Pruning at Initialization (OPaI), a branch of PaI, aims to reduce costs through single-step pruning.  Two representative OPaI methods, SNIP [22] and GraSP [37], utilize gradient information from the initial network to identify subnetworks. While both algorithms employ random mini-batches during pruning, the role of the data itself remains unclear.  Furthermore, despite limited experimental evidence, a growing assumption exists that data is not essential in OPaI [12, 19, 32], potentially impacting future OPaI and even broader PaI research.\n\nThis work challenges the presumption of data independence in OPaI. To investigate this, we introduce Discriminative One-shot Network Pruning (DOP), illustrated in Figure 1.  Unlike previous studies, we utilize discriminative data rather than random mini-batches. This approach retains more precise gradient information, preserving crucial network structures and parameters. To identify critical data within a trained classifier for targeted pruning, we generate discriminative image patches using Automatic Concept-based Explanation (ACE) [15].  The ACE algorithm automatically extracts visual concepts crucial for predicting a specific class."}

Así definió el director chileno Sebastián Lelio la obra que compite en la categoría de Mejor Película Extranjera y que tiene en la actuación de Daniela Vega uno de sus puntos más fuertes.\n\nSegún Emol, el guion, coescrito por Lelio y Gonzalo Maza, plasma la lucha de Marina (Vega), una joven transgénero de origen humilde, por despedir a su pareja, Orlando (Francisco Reyes), un hombre divorciado veinte años mayor que ella, quien muere repentinamente.\n\nEl relato narra cómo Marina enfrenta la furia de la familia de Orlando, avergonzada de que se haya enamorado de una mujer transgénero, revelando los prejuicios que afectan a diario a la comunidad transgénero en Chile y en el mundo.\n\n“Es una película atrevida, con un excelente guion y maravillosas actuaciones, filmada por Lelio y producida por los Larraín (Pablo y Juan de Dios) de forma delicada”, comentó Jorge López Sotomayor, presidente de la Asociación de Directores y Guionistas de Chile (ADG).\n\nLópez Sotomayor asegura que el cine chileno está en auge y la película de Lelio es un fiel reflejo del éxito obtenido en los últimos años por la industria cinematográfica local.\n\nEl desafío actual es mantener la calidad y aumentar la taquilla local, sin descuidar la proyección internacional, añade el director.  Tras el fin del régimen militar, el cine fue una de las plataformas que narró al mundo las historias que marcaron ese período. Pero en los últimos años, el panorama se ha ampliado.\n\n“En los últimos años ha habido un aumento fenomenal de la diversidad temática, que permite abordar temas incómodos desde múltiples ámbitos y perspectivas, y eso es reconocido y celebrado a nivel internacional”, destacó.\n\nEl camino iniciado por Pablo Larraín con “No” y “El Club”, y seguido por el propio Lelio con “Gloria”, películas premiadas en numerosos festivales internacionales, le ha otorgado a Chile una presencia inédita en la escena mundial.\n\n“Una mujer fantástica” es la cuarta película chilena nominada a los premios de la Asociación de la Prensa Extranjera de Hollywood, después de “Neruda” y “El Club” de Larraín, y “La Nana”, dirigida por Sebastián Silva, que compitió por un Globo de Oro en 2010.\n\nUn triunfo de la obra de Lelio este domingo le daría a una película chilena su primer Globo de Oro. Para lograrlo, “Una mujer fantástica” competirá con la favorita “The Square”, del sueco Robert Östlund; la alemana “En la penumbra”; la rusa “Sin amor”; y la camboyana “Primero mataron a mi padre”, dirigida por Angelina Jolie.\n\nEl drama, que busca desterrar etiquetas y llevar a la reflexión sobre por qué se complica algo tan sencillo como el amor entre dos personas, sirvió de plataforma para su protagonista. Ovacionada en festivales, Vega apareció recientemente en la portada de la revista W Magazine junto a Robert Pattinson, una de las jóvenes figuras de Hollywood, confirmando que su personaje trascendió la pantalla y conquistó a la industria.\n\nEn conversación con AFP, Vega reconoció que su historia personal no se asemeja a la de Marina.  Sin embargo, es consciente del costo social que implica ser transgénero en Chile. “No tengo pretensiones de ser referente de ninguna persona ni de nada”, afirmó Vega, quien se mostró confiada en que la película pueda ayudar a quienes necesiten conocer la realidad de las personas transgénero y empatizar con la temática.\n\nPara Juan Enrique Pi, presidente de la Fundación Iguales, el éxito de la película “es una buena noticia”. “Su éxito sirve para visibilizar la realidad de miles de personas que viven en Chile y pertenecen a grupos discriminados”, afirmó en un momento en que el Congreso discute un proyecto de ley que regula la situación jurídica de las personas transgénero."}

{"text": "Extended reality (XR), encompassing virtual, augmented, and mixed realities, has garnered significant attention from both research and industry.  Virtual Reality (VR) facilitates the development of interactive Virtual Environments (VEs), offering simulated experiences of real or imagined scenarios.  These VEs can be displayed on non-immersive platforms like television screens or, for a more compelling experience, on VR headsets. Headsets offer a distinct advantage over non-immersive devices by creating a sense of physical presence within the virtual world, further enhanced by haptic controllers that enable quasi-natural interaction.  This technology finds application in diverse training scenarios, simulating environments such as operating rooms, firestorms, and classrooms [1].  Within these simulations, Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs)—multimodal Conversational Agents (CAs) with 3D human-like avatars—play a crucial role in assisting users throughout the training process [2] or acting as virtual human counterparts [3].  Effective interaction between ECAs and human users in these applications relies heavily on spoken communication. However, many existing CAs are limited to text-based interaction.\n\nThis work introduces an open-source architecture for interfacing CAs with VEs, enabling voice-based conversations between CAs and users within the VE.  This architecture utilizes two customizable modules for Speech-To-Text (STT) and Text-To-Speech (TTS). We tested the architecture in a simulated point-of-care scenario, featuring two custom-designed CAs tasked with collecting symptoms (triage room) and patient medical history (anamnesis room).  This project leveraged Unity for VE development (designed for Oculus Quest 2 headsets), Rasa for CA development, publicly available avatars [4], and publicly available STT [5] and TTS [6] models.

{"text": "Is Venus safe, or merely survivable, for human life? This is the central question scientists are grappling with.  What other approaches are they considering for Venus exploration? What makes Venus so valuable that scientists would risk their lives to study it? These are the questions NASA is pondering as it contemplates missions to Venus.\n\nVenus, the planet closest to the Sun after Mercury, presents a harsh atmospheric environment, but one potentially bearable for humans.  As the text explains, NASA's proposed solution to the hostile surface conditions involves having scientists float above the intense heat and pressure.  At over thirty miles above the surface, temperatures would still be hot, around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be similar to Earth's at sea level.  Furthermore, solar power would be abundant, and radiation levels would be comparable to Earth's.  While challenging, these conditions are potentially survivable.  A vehicle, unlike a human, can hover above Venus, effectively avoiding the hazardous surface conditions.  This explains why Venus, though not safe, might be survivable for humans.\n\nScientists are drawn to Venus because of its potential for past life and its geological features. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.  Long ago, Venus was likely covered largely by oceans and may have supported various life forms, much like Earth.  The planet's surface consists of rocky sediment and includes familiar features like valleys, mountains, and craters. This potential for discovery explains why scientists consider Venus worth the risk of human exploration."}

{"text": "Jeffrey closed the door behind him and stepped quickly into the hallway. He hurried along, resisting the urge to run for fear of disturbing the patients—or the orderlies, for that matter.  Nobody likes a running doctor.\n\nJesus had arrived long before Jeffrey transferred to the facility. The *first* Jesus, anyway. The second had come nearly a year later. In the realm of delusions, believing oneself to be Jesus is hardly cause for confinement. This facility was more of a resort than a hospital.  With no violent patients, it probably saw less trouble than the average retirement home.  But now, it housed two Jesuses.  And then there were three.\n\nWhat struck Dr. Jeffrey Jones as odd, however, wasn't that three men claimed to be the same person, Jesus of Nazareth. It was their names: Mark John, Philip Thomas, and James Matthew.  They sat together in the otherwise empty dayroom, and if he didn't hurry, he would miss whatever exchange was taking place.\n\nIt was a calculated risk, of course. Three men with similar delusions would never be permitted in the same room under normal circumstances. Three men with *conflicting* delusions, even less so; surely there could be only one Jesus of Nazareth. But the staff had arranged it anyway.  Their initial attempt to introduce the three in Dr. Jones’s presence had failed; they hadn't spoken a single word to one another.\n\nNow, Jeffrey hurried toward the observation room, eager to observe them unseen. He practically burst through the door, startling his assistant, Abigail, as he often did.  \"Passion,\" he’d once told her, \"has no substitute in anything, including work.\"  She sighed and shook her head.\n\n\"How are they?\" he asked.\n\nShe frowned. \"They? You made it very clear to empty the room before we let *Jesus* in, Doctor Jones.\"\n\nHe sighed, shaking his head. \"Very funny, Abigail. What's going on?\"\n\nHe made his way to the observation window and frowned. Where there should have been three chairs, there was only one. \"He's just been sitting there. What's the joke?\"\n\nHe frowned again. \"Where are the other two?\"\n\n\"The other two *what*?\"\n\n\"Jesuses.\"\n\nNow Abigail was frowning. \"There's only one Jesus, Jeff. There's always only been *one* Jesus.\"\n\nHe looked back at her puzzled expression before returning his gaze to the room. Mark John looked back at him. No, perhaps it was Philip Thomas. Or James Matthew? The bright overhead lights made it difficult to tell.  Jesus smiled up at the doctor, and Jeffrey’s breath caught in his throat.  It was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen."}

{"text": "Knowledge distillation (KD) transfers information from a teacher model to a student model, thereby improving the student's performance (Hinton et al., 2015).  Student models are typically smaller neural networks with lower learning capacity than their teacher counterparts.  KD has been widely used to compress large pre-trained models like CLIP and GPT-3 (Liu et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022; West et al., 2021), addressing the high resource consumption and inference costs that limit their deployment in downstream applications (Brown et al., 2020; Radford et al., 2021).\n\nWhile recent research has explored why KD improves model performance (Yuan et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2021), fewer studies have investigated its other benefits.  This study demonstrates that KD not only improves generalization performance but also enhances model interpretability, a crucial indicator of reliability.\n\nUnderstanding the internal decision-making processes of neural networks, often considered \"black boxes,\" has been a persistent challenge (Singla et al., 2019; Sundararajan et al., 2017; Ribeiro et al., 2016).  Explainability is essential for applying large models like CLIP and GPT-3 to diverse research areas (Gerlings et al., 2021; van der Velden et al., 2022).  Many studies equate higher interpretability with object-centric activation (Fong & Vedaldi, 2017; Dabkowski & Gal, 2017; Zintgraf et al., 2017).  Our findings indicate that KD promotes object-centricity in student model activation maps, thus enhancing their interpretability.\n\nFigure 1 summarizes our key arguments.  We used the number of concept detectors from network dissection (Bau et al., 2017) as our interpretability metric.  This metric reflects the degree of object-centricity in activation maps and is directly proportional to interpretability.  We compared the interpretability of models trained from scratch (f<sub>scratch</sub>) and models trained using KD (f<sub>KD</sub>), as illustrated in Figures 1(a) and 1(b). The activation maps reveal that f<sub>KD</sub> exhibits greater object-centricity than f<sub>scratch</sub>.\n\nWe attribute this enhanced interpretability to the transfer of class-similarity information from teacher to student.  Teacher model distributions exhibit high similarity between semantically related classes.  For instance, with a Border Collie input image, the student model is trained to minimize the distance to the teacher's distribution (z<sub>t</sub>), which assigns high probability to \"dog\" related classes.  Consequently, the student model learns the characteristic features of \"dog\" from \"dog\" samples, fostering object-centricity in its learned representations.\n\nTo confirm that class-similarity information enhances interpretability, we measured the entropy of semantically similar classes, verifying its transfer via logit distillation.  We compared f<sub>KD</sub> with a model trained using label smoothing (f<sub>LS</sub>), a technique that negatively impacts class-similarity information. Figures 1(b) and 1(c) show that f<sub>LS</sub> learns background features rather than object features, reducing interpretability. In the Border Collie example, f<sub>LS</sub> increases the probability of irrelevant classes (e.g., valley) by minimizing the distance to a uniform distribution (u), resulting in less object-centric activation maps.  Thus, KD enhances both performance and interpretability, while LS diminishes interpretability.\n\nBeyond analyzing the presence or absence of class-similarity information, we also examined its degree.  Following Chandrasegaran et al. (2022), who demonstrated calibrating this information transfer by adjusting the temperature of KD with a label-smoothed teacher (f<sub>teacher LS</sub>), we analyzed the impact of f<sub>teacher LS</sub> on student interpretability at various temperatures."}

But I don't take no bribes from nobody. That's why they're so mad all the time! But I tell 'em, I say, 'It's not gon' na matter to me! Only thing matters is the good of the country, and that's what I'm doin'!\" She threw back the next drink as soon as it arrived.\n\nLeaning in, she whispered with an unappealing seductive smile, \"So are you friend or foe, Mr. Jenkins?\"\n\nJenkins wasn't my real name. One always used an alias on the job.  Being a hitman in these times was one of the most hazardous occupations. Our lives were a constant \"dying a thousand deaths.\" For some, this was enjoyable; a way to conquer the fear of death. For the rest of us, it was torture. Dying to live, but seeing no other way.\n\n\"Why, Carolyn, do you really believe I could be anything but a friend to a woman such as yourself?\" I raised an eyebrow.\n\nA devilish look crossed her face.  \"Do you care that I have a husband?\" she mumbled, even closer. The stench of alcohol, sterile and calming, flooded my nostrils. A familiar scent, a reminder of my purpose.\n\nI slipped an arm around her waist, steadying her, controlling the situation. \"It doesn't matter to me. I'm in public service, remember?\" I paused for her reaction.  She pressed her head against my shoulder, nuzzling my neck.\n\n\"Let's go back to my place,\" I whispered in her ear.\n\nCarolyn giggled, stumbling to her feet, fumbling with her expensive peacoat. \"Lead the way, hot stuff,\" she commanded, poking me in the chest and winking.\n\nOutside, the crisp autumn air was a harsh reminder of things to come.  *The alcohol will numb the pain,* I thought, pulling her toward the parking lot.\n\n\"Which of them is yours?\" she muttered.\n\nThen, a new plan, a lightning strike of inspiration. A chance to avoid the pain of another death.  I'd died a thousand times already. This was an escape. I couldn't say if every job was worth the money, but given my situation, I had no other choice.\n\n\"Actually, my dear, I have a chateau with a hot tub and champagne just across the street. Mind if we walk? We've both had too much to drive.\"\n\nShe clicked her tongue. \"You'll just owe double when we get there!\"\n\n\"Don't worry, love, you'll be treated with the utmost care,\" I chuckled falsely.\n\nAt the edge of the road, I restrained her. \"No, there's a car coming!\" I shouted, ensuring potential witnesses heard.\n\nShe waved dismissively. \"You tell me when to cross then, babe.\"\n\nI waited, spotting a swerving vehicle with no headlights.  \"Go now,\" I whispered, tugging her wrist.\n\n\"I'm readyyyy!\" she yelled, stumbling into the road, arms flung wide.\n\nAs the car hurtled towards her, I emitted a perfectly timed bellow and lunged forward, a futile gesture.\n\nThe impact sent her body flying. A crack echoed. A scream from the car. It crashed into a tree.\n\nAn older couple rushed over. \"What happened?\" they panted.\n\nFeigning distress, I stammered, \"She was drunk… I was walking her home… She ran out… No lights… I've been drinking too… Oh God! My fault!\" My body trembled convincingly. No pain. No pain this time. This bounty… maybe I could retire.\n\n\"Young man, it's not your fault,\" the woman soothed, patting my back."}

Though they represent a novel form of transportation, I believe traditional taxis will remain prevalent for the foreseeable future.\n\nOne significant concern is the requirement for drivers or passengers to remain fully aware of their surroundings. If constant vigilance is necessary, it raises questions about the true autonomy of these vehicles and their overall safety for public roads.  While the potential environmental benefits, such as halving fuel consumption compared to taxis, are substantial and could significantly reduce humanity's carbon footprint, safety for passengers and other vehicles must be Google's top priority.\n\nI acknowledge the potential of self-driving technology to revolutionize the taxi industry.

Rodríguez ha calificado este encuentro de \"escandaloso\" y ha criticado la postura del Gobierno respecto a la visita del presidente de la Asamblea Nacional de Venezuela, Juan Guaidó.\n\nEl objetivo de la comisión de investigación, según Rodríguez, es triple. En primer lugar, busca esclarecer \"cómo es posible que el avión de la vicepresidenta de una 'narcodictadura' haya aterrizado en suelo español\". En segundo lugar, pretende determinar \"por qué el señor Ábalos se ha reunido con ese número dos (de Venezuela), desatendiendo cualquier tipo de estrategia de la UE\".  Finalmente, la comisión busca dilucidar \"cómo es posible que un ministro de España pueda dar cuatro versiones diferentes en 24 horas\" sobre lo ocurrido.\n\n\"Nos parece del todo escandaloso que el señor Ábalos haya dado hasta cuatro versiones en 24 horas, con un tono despótico y altanero con la prensa, supongo que al sentirse incómodo porque le están pillando en contradicciones sistemáticamente\", ha sostenido Rodríguez.  A esto se suma, según ha leído en prensa,  el supuesto enfrentamiento entre el ministro del Interior, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, y el propio Ábalos, una situación que considera \"no seria\" para un país como España.  Para Rodríguez, este comportamiento \"no es reflejo de lo que debería ser un buen Gobierno\".\n\nRodríguez ha criticado que Ábalos \"no esté del lado de los demócratas, de los que defienden los derechos y libertades del pueblo venezolano\", y ha acusado al Gobierno de Pedro Sánchez de estar \"totalmente podemizado por el señor Iglesias\", sin querer especular sobre las razones.\n\nFinalmente, ha considerado \"una vergüenza y una desfachatez\" la decisión del presidente Pedro Sánchez de no reunirse con Guaidó, sobre todo, ha recalcado,  mientras \"manda a un ministro a reunirse con la vicepresidenta de una narcodictadura\"."}

{"text": "The news showed Senator Henry grinning. \"Congress has voted to make me Speaker of the House. I am now Speaker of the House. It was a unanimous decision.”  I wrinkled my brow.  His elation was understandable, but the repetition grated. *We get it,* I thought, flipping channels to a mindless cartoon.  Anything to stave off sleep and the nagging memory of the news. My three-month-old daughter, Victoria – Tory, as I often thought of her – was in my arms, crying. Screaming, really.  I hated the thought of Kate having to soothe her in the dead of night.\n\nKate, my wife, was perpetually exhausted. Kind, smart, loving, and exhausted. Her workdays were longer than mine, often starting before sunrise and ending after sunset. Yet, she never complained.  Sometimes I worried she resented my eight-hour days and the extra time I had with Tory. But every other Friday, for the past eight months, she’d beam, showing me her growing savings account, “Victoria’s School.” Each $100 increment brought her close to tears, and me along with her.  So, I took the night shift with Tory, letting Kate get some rest.\n\nThe next morning, after dropping Tory at daycare, the radio blared, “In other news, a Chicago lawyer secured a double-murder acquittal by arguing George Washington condoned killing your neighbor for sleeping with your wife. And the Cincinnati Zoo welcomes a baby hippo!”\n\nI nearly slammed on the brakes. *What?* I pulled into the parking lot at work and frantically searched my phone.  There it was: the lawyer shaking hands with a client radiating anger and regret. \"Not Guilty!\" the headline screamed. Further down, an even more bizarre headline: \"President Jacks Steps Down, Senator Henry Appointed.\"  Apparently, a private conversation led President Jacks to believe Henry would do a better job.  Shaking my head, I went into work.\n\nI worked at Leo’s Used Cars, home of the “cerrrrazy” deals – more like swindles.  I wouldn't buy a single car on that lot, and selling them to people with poor credit and low incomes made me feel slimy.  Yet, in a year and a half, I'd become the top salesman. I was a good liar. I could sell ice to an Eskimo.\n\nThat day, I sold seven vehicles, a new record. Enough commission to match Kate's contribution to Tory's savings and take a day off with her. It was ridiculously easy.  I lied about gas mileage, they believed me.  I claimed the tires were new, and even I almost believed it.  A few times, I simply said, \"It's a great car,\" and somehow, it seemed to become shinier, sleeker, better.\n\nOn the way home, with Tory in the backseat, the radio announced, \"Newly appointed Chief Justice Henry accepts position.”  I shook my head again.  The same Henry?  At home, I looked up the news. Different Henry. But a photo of the new Chief Justice shaking hands with the President revealed an uncanny resemblance. Brothers.  I wondered at the lack of public outcry. Where were the riots? The confusion?  Then I realized I wasn't outraged either. It just…made sense.\n\nConfused, I bathed Tory, made dinner, and waited for Kate.  Eager to share my good news, I almost missed her dejected look.  \"I sold seven cars today!\" I announced after kissing her.\n\n\"That's good,\" she replied dully. Taking a deep breath, she confessed, \"I got fired.\"\n\nMy heart sank. We weren't destitute, but we relied on her income. My dismay must have shown, because she started to cry.  I held her close. \"It's okay, it's okay. We'll be fine. We barely needed your job anymore. I can support us. I’ll take care of us,\" I whispered until her sobs subsided.  Looking up, she seemed less exhausted, more relieved.  And strangely, so did I.\n\nThat night, Tory cried as usual. Despite having work the next day, I took her so Kate could rest.  Watching the news, I saw the Henry brothers already reshaping the government, eliminating term limits, and giving themselves raises. Again, I felt a strange sense of acceptance rather than outrage.\n\nThen, it clicked. Like a puzzle piece falling into place, I realized the rules were changing, lies were bending reality. I knew it with the same certainty I knew those seven cars were \"great vehicles.\"\n\nI thought of Kate, sleeping soundly, free of worry. I could lie to the bank, claim our house was paid off. Lie to the credit card company, declare us debt-free. I could see Kate's relieved smile. Then I looked at Tory.\n\nShe wasn't crying. She looked up at me with her baby blue eyes, and I knew better. Struggle was important. Tory would see us fight for her education, watch us work hard, and learn from our example.  If things were easy, she wouldn't understand the battles life throws at you. Not my Tory.\n\n“There’s no such thing as world hunger,” I told her. “There’s plenty of food for everyone. They’ll find a cure for cancer tomorrow.  Cancer is a thing of the past. When people go to jail, they learn their lesson. They learn not to do bad things again.” I took a deep breath. “People are good, Tory. People are innately good! They make mistakes, and they learn. They help each other. They love each other. People are good.”\n\nAll night long, I told her how amazing human nature was, how we should always love each other. Long after she fell asleep, I kept talking."}

Think of your daughter.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" I snarled, but didn't wait for a reply. My fist went through the window. \"WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO TO MY DAUGHTER YOU FUCKING PIECE OF GLASS?!\"\n\nThe man in the mirror looked winded, hurt.\n\nFrom my bedroom, I heard myself yell, \"Bitter! Come here. We need to talk.\"\n\nI tried the back door, but my bloody hand couldn't get a grip past my doppelganger. He just shook his head. \"I can't let you do that, sir.\"\n\nThe adrenaline faded, and the pain in my hand throbbed. A million thoughts raced through my mind. This couldn’t be real. How could I explain this to my family? To anyone?  God, I was so tired.\n\n\"Bitter, look at me,\" my reflection said.  I instinctively glanced up and flinched. I saw my little girl at her desk in her classroom, eagerly raising her hand. The image vanished, replaced by my transparent face in the glass. \"Think about this for a second. Come to the bathroom, fix your hand up, and just hear me out.\"\n\n\"Why can't we talk here?\" I demanded.\n\nHe knocked on the glass. \"We can't exactly have a face-to-face if we can't see each other. And we need to figure out a deal that works for everybody. Besides,\" he gestured to the broken window, \"I'm a little worried about my safety here.\"\n\nI considered his words.  Lacking a better plan, I reluctantly headed back to the bathroom.  With each reflection I passed, I saw fear, disgust, and anger staring back at me.\n\nInside the master bathroom, normalcy returned. My reflection mimicked my every move as I bandaged my hand. I leaned back, waiting for his proposal.\n\n\"It's not always easy, is it?\" he said, \"looking at yourself. Seeing what you've become.  The what-ifs and how-comes slipping through your fingers like water. When you look at yourself, Bitteroldfella, what do you see?\"\n\nHe continued when I didn't answer. \"I'm just being polite. I know what you see, because that's what I am. And I know you hate me. All that bitterness, frustration, and hopelessness, standing in front of you every day, reminding you of all you should have been.  So here we stand, waiting for the other one to blink. How do you see this working out for yourself?\"\n\n\"Simple,\" I snapped. \"I'm going to get my little girl, and anything that gets in my way is getting smashed.\"\n\n\"And how will you get her, Bitter?  You’re going to tell her there’s an army of reflections hiding in the glass? You'll be hospitalized. And what then? Keep her from ever seeing her reflection again?  You're smarter than this.\"\n\n\"Then get to the point!\" I screamed.\n\nWith a condescending smirk, he said, \"It's simple, Bitter. You get a front row seat to watch your daughter's youth pass you by, as yours did."}
{"text": "Despite their mathematical elegance and promising results on simple models, standard stochastic gradient (SG) methods for MCMC-based Bayesian posterior sampling (Welling & Teh, 2011; Ahn et al., 2012; Patterson & Teh, 2013; Chen et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2015) struggle with the complex loss landscapes of deep models (Draxler et al., 2018; Garipov et al., 2018), where stochastic optimization presents significant challenges (Chaudhari & Soatto, 2018; Maddox et al., 2019).  Furthermore, existing methods often require impractical, ad-hoc, and sophisticated vanishing learning rate schedules and extensive hyperparameter tuning.\n\nSG-MCMC algorithms generally inject random noise into SG descent algorithms. The covariance of this noise and the learning rate are tightly coupled to assumptions about the loss landscape, which, along with the SG noise, determine the sampling properties (Ma et al., 2015).  However, when applied to complex models like deep networks, current SG-MCMC algorithms cannot satisfy these simplifying assumptions regarding loss landscapes and SG noise covariance behavior while also meeting practical requirements such as non-vanishing learning rates and ease of use.  While Mandt et al. (2017) advocate for fixed step sizes, their work focuses on variational approximations of simple quadratic losses.  In a general Bayesian deep learning setting, no existing SG-MCMC implementation converges to the true posterior without learning rate annealing.\n\nAlthough others have highlighted these issues (Draxler et al., 2018; Garipov et al., 2018), including the lack of unified notation (Ma et al., 2015), we believe the role of noise in SG-MCMC algorithms requires further investigation.  A deeper understanding is crucial for clarifying the relationships between various methods and, more importantly, for inspiring novel, practical algorithms with fewer tunable parameters and less restrictive assumptions.\n\nThis work presents a mathematical framework (Section 2) that emphasizes the interplay between SG noise covariance and learning rate in SG-MCMC algorithms.  This framework reveals the equivalence between learning rate annealing and injecting high-variance noise, enabling us to propose a novel, practical SG-MCMC algorithm (Section 3) that produces (approximate) posterior samples with a fixed, easily derived learning rate.  Moreover, our approach readily applies to pre-trained models; after a \"warm-up\" phase to estimate SG noise, it can efficiently perform Bayesian posterior sampling.  This proposed SG-MCMC method offers a valid, theoretically sound, and simple alternative to popular techniques that rely on problematic assumptions (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016).\n\nWe evaluate SG-MCMC algorithms (Section 4) through extensive experiments, comparing our approach to alternatives like Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD) (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016) and Stochastic Weight Averaging Gaussians (SWAG) (Maddox et al., 2019), which have seen successful application in Bayesian deep learning.  Our results demonstrate that our approach is simpler to use than other SG-MCMC methods and offers competitive performance in accuracy and uncertainty quantification."}

Enough time to jump on his bike and pedal a full block before he can catch his breath. Before he can call the cops.\n\nTwo blocks down, one block over. 5:14 AM. Thank God it's mostly downhill.  Enough time to knock a businessman—stumbling out of his office after two all-nighters—to the ground.  I jump off the bike and grab his keys. I hear his scream as he falls; a broken leg is a bitch, but I only have enough time.\n\nEnough time to make it to his yellow sports car, to floor the engine. Zero to sixty in under seven seconds is quite useful. Especially right now. He shouldn't be driving anyway. He'd probably crash, killing a mother and two daughters. His wife, his kids.

Blood pounds in my ears, and in my leg. Someone grabs at me; I respond with a right hook. He's down, I'm running. 5:22 AM.\n\nI see her as she enters the crosswalk. I see the tanker, brakes failing, barreling towards her. The tanker was two months overdue for inspection. The driver's license was suspended.

Dead in under a minute.\n\nI'm there, she's in my arms, tears streaming down my face.  Shock dulls the pain. She has just enough energy to lift a hand to my cheek, and smile. I try to shush her, tears rolling down my face, clutching her still form.\n\nGas leaks from the tanker, which has veered into a storefront across the street.

Recently, there has been growing interest in OT for measures supported on manifolds [7, 36], driven by two key factors: (1) real-world data often lie on low-dimensional manifolds embedded in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces, and (2) many applications, such as analyzing geophysical data or cortical signals, inherently involve non-Euclidean geometry.\n\nThis paper focuses on efficiently comparing probability measures supported on the unit circle—also known as circular probability measures—using the OT framework.  These measures, often represented by circular or rose histograms, are prevalent in numerous applications across computer vision, signal processing, geology, and astronomy.  For example, in computer vision, an image's color content can be captured by its hue in the HSV color space, resulting in a one-dimensional circular histogram.  Furthermore, local image/shape descriptors are often represented by circular histograms, as seen in classic computer vision techniques like SIFT [28] and Shape Context [6]. In structural geology, circular histograms represent the orientation of geological formations like bedding planes, fault lines, and joint sets [38].  Similarly, in signal processing, they represent the phase distribution of periodic signals [26], which can also be normalized and represented as circular probability density functions (PDFs).\n\nWhile extensive literature exists on circular statistics [18], the seminal works of [13] and [34] are particularly relevant, providing a thorough analysis of the OT problem and transportation distances on the circle (see also [8]).  The topic's continued relevance is highlighted by recent revisits to OT on circles [7, 17].  Unlike OT on the real line, the OT problem between probability measures on the circle generally lacks a closed-form solution. This is due to the circle's intrinsic metric and the existence of two paths (clockwise and counter-clockwise) between any two points on the circle.  However, a closed-form solution for the 2-Wasserstein distance *does* exist when one of the measures is the Lebesgue measure (i.e., the uniform distribution), which we will discuss in the Background section.\n\nWe introduce Linear Circular OT (LCOT), a novel transport-based distance for circular probability measures.  LCOT leverages the closed-form solution of the circular 2-Wasserstein distance between each distribution and the uniform distribution on the circle, thereby circumventing the need for optimization.  Specifically, we determine the Monge maps that push the uniform distribution to each input measure using this closed-form solution.  The distance between the input measures is then based on the differences between their respective Monge maps."}

{"text": "Larson discovered the breach first. It was a fluke, a timely recollection of an image—a fusion of two distinct moments in time and place, yet sharing identical meaning.\n\nHe'd spent long hours hunched over his computer, the days blurring into a seamless stream of applications and programs.  As a security analyst for a major contractor, Larson shouldered significant responsibility for numerous processes. He was working late, as he often did, relishing the post-departure solitude of his cubicle, where he felt he could truly concentrate. He enjoyed the rhythmic, almost zen-like state of nothingness familiar to anyone who’s spent hours programming or immersed in deep, focused work.\n\nOne evening, while sifting through a subfolder, his phone rang. His boss, whose company held contracts with not only major corporations but government and military entities as well, barked into the receiver:\n\n\"God damn it, Larson! I've had it up to here with you! Are you at the office?\"\n\n\"Yes, I had more work to do—\" Larson stammered, bewildered. How did his boss know he was looking at the Buffalo File?\n\n\"I knew it! What the hell are you doing in the Buffalo File? You know it's off-limits! And what the hell are you doing at the office at this hour? I don't know what I pay you for, sometimes!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. I'm just doing a routine sweep—\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what you're doing. You're wasting air, water, and electricity on my dime! You're fired, that's what you are! You have until tomorrow morning to get out.\"\n\nThe line went dead. Larson began to tremble, but the shock quickly gave way to a strange, habituated compulsion to look at the file again. He double-clicked the folder and scanned the contents.  Rationality had long since abandoned him, replaced by the unsettling familiarity of a file from a dream.\n\nThe second part of Larson's vision stemmed from years earlier, before he was a security contractor, before he was much of anything at all, really, except a deadbeat mooching off his parents and smoking copious amounts of marijuana. He’d had a dream. Whether a product of a damaged neocortex, his upbringing and education, his psychology, or a genuine vision as he maintained, it had not only stuck with him but become a part of him. Even now, sitting in the office chair that was no longer his, he recalled it vividly. He’d dreamt he was sitting there, scrolling through that very folder, and finding himself."}
{"text": "The image known as the \"Face on Mars\" has sparked speculation about alien involvement. However, a closer look at the facts reveals a more terrestrial explanation.  As the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" explains, the image shows a large rock formation resembling a human head. This appearance is caused by shadows that create the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth.  The formation is essentially the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, landforms common in the American West.  Garvin, quoted in the article, compares it to Middle Butte in Idaho, a lava dome forming an isolated mesa of similar height.\n\nWhile some maintain the belief in an alien origin, the idea raises a fundamental question: why would aliens create a human face, especially if they had never encountered humans before?  Personally, while I remain open to the possibility of life beyond Earth, I believe the \"Face on Mars\" is a natural phenomenon, a coincidental arrangement of rock and shadow.  The image itself, along with the evidence presented in the article, clearly points to a natural rock formation, not an alien artifact."}

{"text": "About 25 years ago, on May 24, 2001, NASA's Viking spacecraft, while orbiting Mars, captured an image of what appeared to be a huge, human-like face in the Cydonia region.  This face, nearly two miles long, seemed to stare back at the camera.\n\nInitially, the formation sparked speculation and questions about its origins.  Could such a distinct shape be merely a natural landform?  Later, the Mars Global Surveyor provided a definitive answer.  Flying over Cydonia, it took a photograph of the same area, but with ten times the resolution of the original Viking image.  Despite cloudy conditions requiring the camera to penetrate the haze, the higher resolution picture clearly revealed the “face” to be a natural geological formation.\n\nSome skeptics argued that the clearer image was achieved *because* of the haze, suggesting it obscured evidence of artificial construction.  However, this argument is illogical.  A hazy image would obscure details, not enhance them. The clarity of the Mars Global Surveyor image, despite the clouds, provides strong evidence against artificial construction.  Therefore, the combined evidence of the original image and the significantly clearer follow-up strongly supports the conclusion that the \"face on Mars\" is nothing more than a fascinating, but ultimately natural, landform."}

A telling example of their improvement is evident in their performance against Nipmuc, Nashoba, and Quabbin.  In 2018, these three teams handed Holy Name a trio of losses in quick succession. This year, the fifth-ranked Naps (7-1) have flipped the script, defeating all three in the opening month of the 2019 season.\n\nThese victories haven't been against pushovers. The Naps opened their season with a thrilling 3-2 win over fourth-ranked Nashoba, a victory secured by a late goal from sophomore sensation Hayley Houston.  Longtime coach Bill Manzello noted this as Holy Name's first win over the Chieftains in nearly two decades.  They followed this up with a decisive 2-0 shutout against seventh-ranked Nipmuc, the program's first regular-season win over the Warriors in over ten years.  A commanding 4-0 performance against a strong and experienced Quabbin squad further solidified their impressive start.\n\n\"We want to be respected as one of the better teams around, but we have to earn that respect,\" said Manzello, whose team has found its rhythm with three consecutive shutouts since a narrow 1-0 loss to fourth-ranked Wachusett on September 17th.\n\nHouston’s arrival has been a key factor in this resurgence. Opting to play high school soccer over her elite club team, the eighth-grader-turned-Nap has already netted 16 goals before the halfway mark of the season. “She’s a special talent,” Manzello praised. “It was a big boost…She’s a very, very good player.”  Manzello highlighted Houston's ability to beat defenders one-on-one while also recognizing when to distribute the ball, coupled with a powerful shot with both feet."}

{"text": "Venus: Earth's Twin with a Fiery Temper\n\nVenus, often called the \"Evening Star,\" is one of the brightest objects in the night sky, easily spotted even by amateur stargazers.  This captivating planet, second from the sun, shares striking similarities with Earth, making it our closest planetary neighbor in terms of size and density.  This resemblance has earned Venus the title of Earth's twin, but a closer look reveals a world of stark contrasts and daunting challenges for exploration.\n\nThe similarities between Venus and Earth initially fueled speculation about the possibility of life.  Like Earth, Venus is believed to have once harbored vast oceans and potentially supported various life forms.  Its surface features familiar geological formations such as mountains, valleys, and craters, further strengthening the comparison.  This proximity and potential for past life make Venus a prime target for planetary investigation, representing the nearest option for a potential interplanetary visit.\n\nHowever, the dream of a readily accessible sister planet is quickly shattered by Venus's harsh realities.  Beneath its brilliant facade lies a hostile environment. Its atmosphere, composed of 97% carbon dioxide, traps heat, resulting in a surface temperature that is the hottest in our solar system – hot enough to melt lead.  Adding to this inferno are clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid.  Even at thirty miles above the surface, temperatures remain a scorching 170 degrees Fahrenheit, though the air pressure at this altitude is comparable to Earth's sea level, offering a marginally survivable environment for humans.\n\nThe extreme conditions on Venus present enormous challenges for exploration.  Landing on the surface is incredibly dangerous, forcing researchers to observe the planet from afar.  This remote observation severely limits data collection, as researchers cannot directly sample rocks, gases, or other materials."}

{"text": "Venus, often called the \"Evening Star,\" is the second planet from our sun and one of the brightest objects in the night sky.  Its brilliance often leads to it being mistaken for a star. While easily visible from Earth, closer examination presents significant challenges.  Though sometimes Mars is closer to Earth due to the varying speeds of planetary orbits, Venus remains a prime target for exploration.  However, this exploration comes at a cost.  Despite being similar to Earth in size and density, Venus presents a hostile environment that has thwarted numerous missions.\n\nVenus's reputation as a challenging planet for study is well-earned.  Its thick atmosphere, composed of 97% carbon dioxide, traps heat, resulting in scorching surface temperatures averaging over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.  The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than Earth's.  These extreme conditions mean any spacecraft attempting a landing would be quickly liquefied and destroyed.  This explains why no spacecraft has survived on Venus's surface for more than a few hours, and why it has been over three decades since the last attempted landing. All previous missions have been unmanned.\n\nDespite these inhospitable conditions, scientists remain fascinated by Venus.  Its similarity to Earth in size and density suggests that it may once have been much more Earth-like, possibly even harboring oceans and supporting life.  This possibility, coupled with the planet's intriguing geological features, including valleys, mountains, and craters, fuels the desire for further exploration.\n\nWhile exploring Venus is undeniably dangerous and complex, the potential rewards are significant.  Understanding the evolution of a planet so similar to our own could provide valuable insights into Earth's past and future, and perhaps even reveal whether life once existed beyond our planet.  This makes Venus a worthy pursuit, despite the inherent risks."}

I find this highly improbable.\n\nMy own theory centers on natural processes.  Landforms can create surprisingly unusual shapes. I suspect the sun played a role, perhaps melting or shifting the terrain just so, to create the illusion of a face. It's certainly more plausible than an alien sacrificing themselves and remaining perfectly preserved for millennia.\n\nThe widespread attention this image received is surprising, yet understandable.  I imagine the average person hearing about a \"Face on Mars\" would be intrigued, even shocked.  After much discussion, my partner and I have reached a compromise:  we agree that the current evidence points towards natural land formation and doesn't support the existence of aliens."}

He carried it deftly back across The Two Horns, avoiding the gaze of the gorgon who’d been haunting him for the better part of the month.  He slid back onto the bench and regarded the pint, still trying to work out whether he'd been swindled.\n\n“Something wrong with the sauce, son?” Mephisto nudged his elbow, bringing Azazel out of his trance.\n\n“Cost me twenty, that did.”\n\n“Same as mine.”\n\n“Yeah. What I’m saying is, pints cost *twenty* now?”\n\n“You haven’t been up in a while, have you, mate?”\n\n“Well, I’m not the salesman like you, Meph,” Azazel said, letting his annoyance seep into the conversation. “I did my job, and now I’m done.”\n\n“Expecting a better return on investment, were you?”\n\n“I suppose. How many of *them* are there now?”\n\n“’Bout seven?  A bit more.”\n\n“Christ.”\n\nMephisto laughed. “I know, man. Soon it’ll cost less to just go up and buy a pint *there*.”\n\n“I mean, are they doing anything about it? You’re the economist. I won’t be able to afford coming here soon.”\n\n“Not much they can do,” Mephisto said, combining a sip with a shrug. “Pandaemonium keeps moaning on about whatever they can, but they—and everyone else—are just realizing how long they’ve been caught twiddling their thumbs.  Basically, right at the same time the human population began to explode—because of the industrial revolution—Heaven put in these new policies that are just now starting to pay off.” The salesman in him was getting excited, the cause of the rambling. He loved having something complicated to explain, especially when it involved spiritual currency.  “They’ve been long-conning us, for sure. We thought we had the whole thing wrapped up, what with the entire human race being born into damnation. But with predestination, that made everyone work as hard as they could to convince themselves they *were* predestined. Heaven skimmed off the top, sent the rest to us, and we thought, ‘Sounds like a pretty good deal.’ Now we’re realizing that quantity is not better than quality. They’ve managed to send Hell’s entire economy downwards, pardon the expression."}

Darlene de Souza, de penalti en la segunda mitad, marcó el gol del honor para las locales.\n\nEl tempranero gol del Atleti a los tres minutos encarriló el partido y despejó cualquier incertidumbre que pudiera generar un triunfo del Barcelona.  En la Ciudad Deportiva de Buñol, Patri Guijarro, Lieke Martens, Marta Torrejón, Andressa Alves y Natasha Andonova anotaron los goles del Barça ante un Levante que finalizó la Liga en mitad de tabla (38 puntos).\n\nCon este triunfo, las jugadoras dirigidas por Ángel Villacampa suman el tercer título a las vitrinas del club, tras la Copa de la Reina de 2016 y la Liga conquistada la temporada pasada.\n\n\n--CLASIFICACIÓN.\n\nEQUIPOS | PTSP | J | P | G | E | PP | GF | GC\n------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------\n1.

The author maintains that these conditions, while harsh, are not insurmountable for human ingenuity.\n\nWith a little creativity and curiosity, the author suggests, we can unlock Venus's secrets. While past missions have faced significant challenges, with most spacecraft succumbing to the planet's harsh conditions within hours, this shouldn't deter further exploration.  The author questions why scientists would even attempt these missions if they believed life there was impossible.\n\nThe article highlights astronomers' fascination with Venus, noting, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.\" This possibility that Venus once supported life raises the intriguing question of whether it could do so again.\n\nWhile acknowledging the dangers of Venus's current conditions, the author believes solutions can be found.  One proposed solution, described in the article, is a \"blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape.\" This approach would allow exploration while avoiding the intense surface temperatures and pressures. However, the author concedes that remote observation from such a vehicle would provide limited data about ground conditions.\n\nThe article also highlights NASA's innovative work developing silicon carbide electronics capable of withstanding Venus's harsh environment.  It mentions, \"some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.\"  This represents significant progress compared to the mere hours of operational capacity of previous spacecraft.\n\nThe author expresses hope that NASA's continued advancements will eventually enable safe human exploration of Venus."}

{"text": "**Extraños actos de los gatos**\n\nLas mascotas suelen tener comportamientos inexplicables para sus dueños. En el caso de los gatos, esto sucede con mucha más frecuencia que con otros animales, pero todo responde a una sencilla razón.  Muchos de los dueños optan por comprar elaboradas estructuras para sus gatos, pero algunos de ellos prefieren las cajas, bolsas, maletas o mochilas. Esto se debe a que, por instinto, buscan lugares cerrados y pequeños para acechar a sus presas, evitando ser vistos.  Algunos de sus movimientos responden a la necesidad de cazar, pues contrario a otros animales, los gatos no han perdido sus instintos naturales y, por tanto, su necesidad de cazar y comer, aún estando dentro de casa.\n\nUna de las cosas que más hacen los gatos es frotarse sobre sus dueños.  Es una forma de demostrar cariño, pues le dicen al mundo que eres de ellos. En ocasiones, este comportamiento también puede indicar una necesidad.  Asimismo, si tu gato amasa las mantas, cojines e inclusive a ti, es algo completamente normal. Cuando los gatos son pequeños, amasan para que la leche salga más fácil de su madre;  de adultos, es una forma de demostrar cariño o felicidad.\n\nPuede que tu gato llegue con un pequeño animal muerto a tu casa. Este comportamiento tiene varias explicaciones. Una de ellas es que interpreta que eres el peor cazador de la manada y no desea que pases hambre. Otra es que quiere compartir contigo lo que ha cazado, haciéndote parte de su familia.\n\nLa mayoría de las personas optan por los perros pues suelen ser más cariñosos que los gatos. Para quienes se preguntan el porqué de este comportamiento felino menos efusivo, deberán saber que es normal y no significa que no amen a sus dueños. Es más bien una forma de llamar la atención.\n\nFoto: iStock\n\nCon información de medios."}

Mr. Williamson, accompanied by Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns, met with RAF and Army representatives to discuss the base's future and proposed developing new barracks at the site.\n\nHe stated, “We want to see more service personnel based here in Wales…bringing wealth, prosperity, and opportunity.”  Mr. Williamson claimed the Welsh Government is \"resisting\" and \"not properly engaging\" with proposals to increase the number of army personnel stationed at St Athan.  He emphasized the potential economic benefits of new barracks, including job creation and increased prosperity, but expressed frustration with the Welsh Government's alleged refusal to consider the proposals necessary for this investment.  “Sadly all the options we keep putting forward…is something the Welsh Government are resisting and not properly engaging with us about,\" he added.  \"This will have an enormous impact on the local economy, guaranteeing jobs, guaranteeing prosperity, but sadly at the moment the Welsh Government is refusing to look at the options…to make that investment happen.”\n\nA Welsh Government spokesman countered this claim, welcoming military investment but highlighting the UK Government's cancellation of the £14bn Defence Training Academy at St Athan in 2010, a project that had promised 2,000 jobs.

Heart thumping, convinced the cops were coming, almost backing out, but unable to resist.\"\n\n\"Only degenerates steal candy,\" the prisoner retorted.  \"You're talking about *killing* someone.\" His hands balled into fists within the restraints.\n\nThe suited man leaned forward, judgment heavy in his gaze.  The confession had been surprisingly easy. A slip during interrogation, a detail only the victim and her mother could have known, and the rest had followed. “It’s no different,\" the prisoner continued, a disturbing relish coloring his tone. \"After the first time, the candy gets so much sweeter. Enjoying something you shouldn’t… it’s incredible.  Do you know the exact DNA sequence of the common house tabby? I do. I shouldn't. But the fact that I do… it's so sweet.\"  He arched his back, a soft moan escaping his lips, before snapping forward, hungry eyes locking onto the suited figure’s flat stare.  “And the best part? You never know what you’re going to get. Do you know what the female orgasm feels like?”\n\n“You’re sick,” the suited man stated, his expression not one of disgust, but a strange disappointment. \"How did it take me so long to find you? It'll be good to watch the world slip from your eyes.  Then I’ll know I've made this world a better place.\"\n\n\"I'll be the first, you know,\" the prisoner said.\n\n\"First what?\"\n\n\"The first death row kill since the change, of course.\" A flicker of something like pride crossed the prisoner’s face. \"I think about it at night.

Capital punishment had been globally abolished twenty years prior. Wars had all but vanished. The world was… peaceful.

{"text": "Change detection in remote sensing plays a critical role in rapid humanitarian assistance and disaster response (HADR) for natural disaster relief.  Improvements in computer vision models for change detection are crucial for accurate identification of areas requiring assistance, enabling effective planning and resource allocation by HADR organizations and communities.  The development of large-scale labeled change detection datasets has fueled this progress.\n\nSelf-supervised learning methods have recently become the dominant approach for pretraining these models due to their simplicity and ability to leverage large unlabeled datasets.  This is particularly relevant in remote sensing and Earth observation, given the abundance of multiview and multimodal data.  For instance, Manas et al. [2] demonstrated performance gains by pretraining with Sentinel-2 imagery of the same location captured in different seasons as multiple views. Similarly, Heidler et al. [3] showed effective learning and improved downstream performance by pretraining on an audiovisual dataset of aerial image and audio pairs, outperforming traditional transfer learning approaches.\n\nSeveral recent studies have explored self-supervised learning for change detection, primarily using pre- and post-event imagery as multiple views. Leenstra et al. [4] used a large dataset of Sentinel-2 imagery to train a model to predict spatial overlap between patches as a pretext task.  Chen et al. [5] employed a contrastive framework with pre- and post-event imagery. However, to the best of our knowledge, no prior work has explored contrastive training using overlapping remotely sensed imagery and 3D surface maps as a pretext task."}

{"text": "I strongly support the development of smart/driverless cars for several compelling reasons: their potential for increased fuel efficiency, enhanced safety features, and reduced driver burden.\n\nThese vehicles promise significant fuel savings, potentially using half the fuel consumed by current taxis.  This efficiency, combined with their personalized routing, offers greater flexibility than public transportation options like buses.  Replacing traditional taxi services with driverless cars also eliminates the potential for human driver error. While the passenger becomes solely responsible for their safety, the removal of human unpredictability from other drivers significantly enhances overall road safety.\n\nSmart cars excel at detecting and responding to road hazards. Equipped with advanced sensors and technology, they can react to dangers faster than a human driver, preemptively applying brakes and mitigating potential collisions. Features like \"Traffic Jam Assistant,\" while still requiring driver alertness, automate much of the driving process in challenging traffic situations, increasing both safety and convenience.\n\nFurthermore, these vehicles offer a safer driving experience even with reduced driver control.  While some might find this paradoxical, the consistent and predictable nature of automated systems minimizes risks associated with human error.  As Werner Huber, a project manager from BMW, points out, this shift requires us to \"interpret driving in a fun new way.\""}

Even though I lay belly-down on his back, yanking the cheap paracord tighter against his neck until my arms hurt. I even checked his pulse.\n\nSean's brother (what's his name again?) seems satisfied with my answer. I briefly squeeze his shoulder, offering a show of support. His eyes lock on mine for a second, trying to thank me. He opens his mouth, but no sound comes out. Nodding instead, he turns and wanders back through the clusters of mourners.\n\nI join a small group sharing stories about Sean's life. Small, almost meaningless actions he performed while alive now confirm the message we've been hearing all afternoon: Sean was a really great guy. Ordinary stories now glow. An unremarkable landscape is caught in this perfect sunset. I knew this would happen, dreaded coming today, but it's not as irritating as I expected.\n\n\"What about you?\" Crap, what are they talking about?\n\n\"Sorry, what were you asking? I was lost in thought.\"\n\nI'm still stuck on the unanswered question. *Why* did I kill Sean? Granted, he'd been a bit of an asshole since I've known him. But that grating feeling I got around him shouldn't have been enough to drive me to *this*.  There's no single action that stands out as unforgivable. I can't even remember all the conversations where he was self-centered, or degraded women, or spouted some cocky know-it-all philosophy. And I'm pretty sure he would have slept with that beyond-drunk girl at his housewarming party if I hadn't stayed behind to prevent it. Hearing stories of him harshly putting down his students doesn't help his case either.\n\nThe truth is, I didn't do it for the students or to defend anyone. I did it because I wanted to kill someone. The urge had been in me since at least middle school, returning every few months a bit stronger."}
{"text": "Manchester City’s 2-1 loss to Lyon on Wednesday, their fourth consecutive Champions League defeat, lays bare the challenge facing the Premier League champions.  Despite racking up 100 points domestically last season and being tipped as favorites for the European title, City struggled in front of a partially empty Etihad Stadium.  The 15,000 empty seats highlight the nagging question of when the Champions League will capture the imagination of the club's fans and players alike.  While other contenders like Liverpool, Real Madrid, and Juventus thrive on fervent home support in European competition, City have yet to cultivate a similar atmosphere. This lack of home advantage is a stark contrast to their domestic dominance. Pep Guardiola's absence due to suspension was cited as a contributing factor to the loss, but the reality remains that City are the first English club to lose four straight Champions League matches, three of which were at home. This disappointing streak underscores the significant hurdle they face in translating their Premier League success to the European stage."}
{"text": "## El Nuevo Sistema Horario de Luz: Preguntas y Respuestas\n\n**¿En qué consiste el sistema horario de luz?**\n\nSi tiene un contador inteligente de luz, su factura se calculará en función del consumo que realice cada hora y del precio que marque en ese momento el mercado mayorista de electricidad (pool).\n\n**¿Cómo puedo saber cuál es el precio?**\n\nEl precio diario estará disponible el día anterior, a partir de las 20:15 horas, en la web de Red Eléctrica de España (REE) o en sitios web que enlacen esta información.  Esto permite al cliente anticiparse al consumo.  Existen diversas aplicaciones móviles que ofrecen esta información.\n\n**¿El sistema funciona desde hoy mismo?**\n\nEl Ministerio de Industria, Energía y Turismo ha publicado la resolución que pone en marcha el nuevo sistema, el cual comenzará el 1 de julio. Las comercializadoras y distribuidoras tendrán un plazo de adaptación hasta el 1 de octubre para implementar el nuevo mecanismo. Los ficheros de intercambio de información entre las empresas y otros aspectos técnicos deberán aplicarse antes del 1 de enero de 2016.\n\n**¿Qué es un contador inteligente?**\n\nLos contadores inteligentes son digitales y están programados para la telegestión por parte de la empresa distribuidora, integrándose en el sistema. Generalmente, las compañías eléctricas los instalan siguiendo sus propios planes y un calendario gubernamental que obliga a sustituir todos los contadores antes de 2018.  Industria aún no ha fijado una fecha límite para la integración en el sistema.\n\n**¿Con esto ya recibo la factura hora a hora?**\n\nExisten dos opciones: que su comercializadora independiente ya ofrezca este servicio (algunas ya lo hacen) o que tenga la tarifa regulada, conocida como Precio Voluntario al Pequeño Consumidor (PVPC).  Puede acceder al PVPC independientemente de si está o no en el mercado libre, siempre que su potencia contratada sea inferior a 10 kilovatios (kW). El PVPC eliminó las subastas eléctricas trimestrales y reimplantó la facturación bimestral. Si el contador es analógico, el recibo se emite cada dos meses con un precio adaptado a perfiles de consumo.\n\n**¿A qué hora será más barata la luz?**\n\nGeneralmente, el mercado mayorista registra precios más bajos en las horas de menor demanda (de medianoche a mediodía) y más altos en las de mayor consumo (tarde y noche hasta las 23:00 horas). La energía eólica puede reducir los precios en días ventosos, mientras que los días anticiclónicos suelen traer precios más altos."}

{"text": "Text-to-image generation models, such as Stable Diffusion [20], GLIDE [15], and DALL·E 2 [18], have significantly advanced, producing high-quality images from textual prompts. While traditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) generate synthetic images from a Gaussian distribution, text-to-image models require textual prompts to create corresponding images, resulting in wider use and greater popularity. These synthetic images have diverse applications, including visualizing novel scenes, generating illustrations for advertising, and creating otherwise unphotographable scenarios. However, they also present societal risks, such as the potential for misuse in spreading misinformation.  Furthermore, text-to-image generative models may impact the art industry by enabling the production of fake artwork.  Therefore, it is crucial to identify the generative model responsible for a given AI-generated image (Figure 1). In other words, we need to accurately attribute unknown-source images to their source models.\n\nPost-hoc analysis of the intrinsic characteristics of content generated by different models allows for source attribution.  Existing research on AI-generated image attribution is primarily training-based, focusing mainly on image ownership from GANs. Some studies utilize classification networks to determine the source of generated content based on inherent feature differences between models.  Yu et al. [31] designed three variant classification networks based on mainstream convolutional neural networks, capable of attributing images generated by four common GAN models. Girish et al. [7] proposed an iterative framework for discovering images generated by unknown GANs, incorporating trainable networks, outlier detection, (Figure 1: The application scenario of AI-generated fake image attribution), clustering, merging, and optimization modules.  Bui et al. [2] introduced RepMix, a GAN fingerprint technology based on representation blending and a novel loss function, significantly improving semantic generalization and robustness to perturbations compared to previous methods. Hirofumi et al. [8] leveraged the latent recovery capability of GAN-generated images for attribution, achieving good results when the image is generated by the source model. These studies assume a known candidate model pool; however, in reality, the image source model may be unknown.\n\nTo address open-set model attribution, Yang et al. [30] pioneered a progressive open-space expansion method, gradually simulating open-set samples through lightweight data augmentation models.  With the rise of large-scale text-based image models, research on their attribution has also begun.  Additionally, some work focuses on passive attribution research for deepfakes."}
{"text": "It started as a normal day at the bank. I was depositing a check from my accounting job, standing in line behind a large man with whom I'd struck up a conversation about the wildly fluctuating weather. I'd just remarked on the crazy wind and how things had taken a turn for the worse when a pair of individuals in balaclavas and heavy winter coats walked in.  \"See, case in point,\" I'd quipped. \"In a couple of days, they'll be putting those away and wearing t-shirts again.\"\n\nIronically, those were my last words before everything went sideways.\n\nSuddenly, shiny metal glinted—guns, imbued with murderous intent.  I felt instantly vulnerable and afraid.  Then, a bizarre thought crossed my mind: I probably wasn't going to make it to the library that day. Apparently, my mind handles crises in strange ways.\n\nThey overpowered the portly, elderly security guard in seconds.  I watched, frozen in shock. The guard looked well past his prime and clearly unable to offer much resistance.  That left the rest of us. The large man I'd been talking to had ducked behind a desk. The drive-through teller remained oblivious, but the other tellers had dropped below their counters, and the remaining customers were shrinking back from the sudden eruption of violence.\n\nDamn. That made me the closest person to the robbers, and likely their next target.  Fortunately, I had a trick up my sleeve, one honed since elementary school for dealing with potentially dangerous individuals. I stared up into a corner of the ceiling, focusing my attention on my nose, willing the blood vessels to dilate. I felt the pressure build, then release.\n\nI cringed, collapsing to the ground, clutching my head.  \"Damn tumor,\" I groaned, feigning pain.  \"Sorry, give me a minute,\" I mumbled, removing one hand and holding it palm up, fingers splayed, towards them. My other hand slid from the side of my head to my forehead. I feigned a spasm of pain before regaining a semblance of composure. I felt the warm stickiness of blood trickling down my lip, tasting the metallic tang. \"Right. I guess I'm…\" I winced again. \"I'll talk. I don't have that much time left anyway.\"\n\nThe bank robbers—because that's what my brain finally registered them as—seemed to soften slightly. \"Hey, no worries, man,\" one of them said. \"We just want the money. Don't get me wrong, we'll absolutely kill anybody that tries anything, but we don't *want* to have to kill anybody.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" I rasped weakly. \"Just take the money and don't shoot anybody.\" I hoped that had bought the bank manager enough time to alert the police.\n\nAfter a few minutes of the robbers shuffling things around, I saw flashing police lights approaching outside. I gestured to the others in the bank to escape. They bolted. I stayed.  Leaving wouldn't have been consistent with the character I'd created. Besides, in these situations, negotiators usually want a hostage to facilitate the robbers' demands.\n\nLeveraging my ability to bleed on cue, I attributed it to stress exacerbating my fictitious tumor."}

This *shouldn't* hurt much.\"  Her words offered little comfort. My gaze fell to the floor.  Click. Click. Bang! Then nothing.\n\nI began a seemingly endless fall, my sense of time distorted.  Finally, a point of light appeared below, or at least, that's where I perceived it.  \"Finally!\" I thought, my disembodied mind relieved. \"I thought I was actually dead there for a second!\"\n\nThe light grew, bringing with it the murmur of voices.  Though unintelligible at first, I soon recognized the scientist who had shot me. \"Oh, he's not going to like this. Not one bit,\" she said. A deep baritone, presumably the surgeon, responded, \"Well, I did the best I could. He's lucky to be alive given the trauma his brain went through.\" He sighed. \"I thought I told you no guns.\"  Her response was a giggle.  \"Well, at least I made it,\" I thought, fading back into unconsciousness.\n\nI awoke in a small, single-windowed room, the beeping of machines and the sterile hospital smell filling the air. \"Ha! I made it!\" I shouted, ripping out my IV lines.  Excitement propelled me out of bed and toward the bathroom mirror down the hall. The exertion winded me, suggesting I'd been out for weeks. Leaning against the wall to catch my breath, I closed my eyes, then stepped in front of the mirror.\n\nOpening my eyes, I stared.  Initial confusion gave way to rage.  Looking back at me, in all my glory, was a fully formed dickbutt."}
{"text": "This article presents new efficient algorithms for evaluating $p$-adic elementary and special functions, achieving quasi-linear time complexity in the desired precision. This represents a significant improvement over previous methods, which often exhibited at least quadratic complexity.  These functions, including polylogarithms, hypergeometric functions, and solutions of \"small\" $p$-adic differential equations, play a crucial role in various mathematical fields such as analysis, geometry, combinatorics, and number theory. Their $p$-adic analogues are equally important, encoding deep arithmetic information, as illustrated by $p$-adic $L$-functions and their connection to Iwasawa theory and algebraic varieties.  The ability to compute these functions efficiently has far-reaching implications for calculating invariants and testing conjectures, mirroring the significance of high-precision evaluation of complex special functions, which has seen remarkable algorithmic advancements.\n\n\nOur algorithms leverage a $p$-adic adaptation of the bit-burst method, pioneered by Chudnovsky and Chudnovsky, which builds upon the binary splitting technique and other ideas originating from Brent's work. This core technique is enhanced by incorporating improvements from later research.  The key to achieving quasi-linear complexity lies in the existence of recurrence relations satisfied by partial sums of series expansions. The binary splitting method efficiently computes the $n$-th partial sum by expressing it as a product of matrices based on this recurrence and constructing a balanced product tree.\n\nWhile binary splitting is highly effective for small integer evaluation points, a multi-step process is employed for general evaluation points. This involves constructing a sequence of intermediate points with increasing bit sizes but decreasing $p$-adic distance to the target. Binary splitting facilitates efficient computation between consecutive intermediate points, ultimately reaching the desired value in quasi-linear time.\n\n\nThe paper is structured as follows: Section 2 establishes the representation of $p$-adic numbers.  Section 3 introduces the $p$-adic bit-burst method through the illustrative example of $\\log(x)$. Section 4 generalizes the method to solutions of linear differential equations. Finally, Section 5 explores applications, including a fast algorithm for evaluating specific logarithmic derivatives connected to Dwork hypergeometric functions.  An important application of our algorithms is the computation of Frobenius matrices acting on the cohomology of fibrations, which satisfy Picard-Fuchs type differential equations.\n\n\nThe present work continues the trend of developing efficient algorithms for $p$-adic computations, exemplified by previous work on the Morita $p$-adic $\\Gamma$-function, $p$-adic hypergeometric functions, certain $p$-adic $L$-functions, and the computation of Frobenius matrices on $p$-adic cohomology.

An ominous feeling washed over me, amplified by the sickening metallic scent of iron emanating from the damp ground.  Something was terribly wrong. Where was I? Why was I here?\n\nAs I stumbled to my feet, fragmented memories returned. A sharp pang of pain… I'd been stabbed. The realization was strangely calm.  A small, hopeful voice whispered that perhaps this was heaven.  After all, I'd been a good person. A good student, respectful to teachers, with decent grades. A good daughter, loving to my parents and siblings.  Twenty years of faithful church attendance, prioritizing my religion above material possessions.  Wasn't that enough?\n\n\"Welcome to the new round! A warm welcome to our new arrivals, and I'm glad to see all of our returning players refreshed and ready to go. The game will start in three minutes.\"\n\nA booming voice shattered my peaceful contemplation. Players? Game? What bizarre fantasy was this?  My mind reeled, unease morphing into paranoia.  If this was the reward for a life dedicated to spiritual fulfillment, I felt cheated.\n\nA feral growl snapped my attention to a figure – a woman, or something more beast than human.  She lunged, lips peeled back to reveal stained teeth.  I braced for impact, but felt nothing. An invisible barrier shielded me from her furious clawing.

However, these systems lack the sophistication to detect nuanced emotional states, including internal conflicts like hypocrisy.  Furthermore, such technology overlooks the diversity of the human experience.  It fails to account for individuals with exceptional talents or mental health conditions, as well as those prone to frustration in unexpected situations.\n\nConsider the example of a comedian.  A joke may only genuinely amuse 30% of the audience. Yet, if that 30% laughs, the remaining 70% may feel compelled to join in, reducing social tension and supporting the comedian, rather than expressing genuine mirth.\n\nThe text mentions a claim of universality (presumably regarding emotional expression), but this overlooks individual differences, much like the existence of left-handed individuals or those with high IQs.  Forcing the technology to assign an emotion to every individual can lead to feelings of exclusion, potentially contributing to mental health issues like suicidal ideation.\n\nThe text also suggests that faces don't lie.  However, this ignores individuals with Down syndrome, whose facial expressions can be misinterpreted, and deceptive individuals, like criminals who feign remorse.  Students, too, can mask their true feelings.  A student might cheat on an exam and then complain to the teacher about its difficulty.\n\nIn conclusion, I have attempted to demonstrate the inherent limitations of using technology to accurately recognize students' emotional expressions.

An apple basket swung from his hand. He’d spent days inside the small structure, his only companion a small cat upon which he lavished affection.\n\nToday was Sunday, a glorious summer Sunday.  A day free from work, save a trip to the market square for supplies.  A day for Dorts Abory to indulge in utter degeneracy – lounging, drinking, and picking apples from his trees without a care in the world.\n\nThe apple fields, a twenty-minute walk, had been cultivated by his family for generations, shared with seven other families.  Constant bickering amongst the collective regarding orchard management was a given. From the fields, it was another twenty-minute walk to town for bread, lamp oil, ice, and ink.  Perhaps, if foot traffic was light, he might even try that new restaurant everyone was talking about.  Although, rumors of a rat problem gave him pause. He might stick with the usual place – the one with the frog issue.\n\nThis idyllic Sunday was, of course, too good to be true.  Destiny, as always, had other plans, scheduled weeks in advance with no regard for Mr. Abory’s own.\n\nTen minutes into his walk, a white stallion and a reindeer pulling a carriage bearing three passengers nearly flattened him.  Abory cursed his luck.\n\n“Are you alright, sir?” asked the blond driver. “I’m not used to carriages, and I might have gone a bit too fast.”\n\n“Yes,” chirped a slick-haired brunette from the back, “the man who delivers ice for a living thinks *you* can go too fast. Can we get moving? I'm uncomfortable.”\n\n“Oh, don’t be such a stick in the mud, Eugene,” countered a red-haired woman. “I’ve never seen this part of your country.  There’s hardly any snow.”\n\nAbory eyed the bickering trio, remembered it was Sunday, and bolted for the woods.  The stallion, with improbable dexterity, snagged him by the collar, hoisting him into the air.\n\nThe horse sniffed him, flinging snow in his face, then pointed a hoof at the basket.\n\n“What?” Abory asked.\n\nThe stallion neighed at the reindeer, who in turn vocalized to the blond.\n\n“Which way to the apple fields?” the blond translated.\n\n“Down the road, left at the pine tree, beware the ducks,” Abory blurted, the last part escaping involuntarily."}

{"text": "Venus, often called the \"Evening Star\" due to its brilliance in the night sky, presents a compelling yet perilous target for exploration.  Its proximity to Earth and the Sun makes it a valuable subject for studying the effects of extreme planetary conditions, such as intense heat, pressure, and a dense, toxic atmosphere.  However, these very conditions pose significant challenges and dangers to any potential mission.\n\nThe dangers on Venus are numerous. A thick atmosphere, composed almost entirely of carbon dioxide, traps heat and creates a runaway greenhouse effect.  Clouds of corrosive sulfuric acid further contribute to the hostile environment.  Surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt lead, and the atmospheric pressure is a crushing 90 times that of Earth.  These extreme conditions explain why no spacecraft has ever successfully landed on Venus.\n\nExploring Venus would require innovative solutions to overcome these challenges.  Scientists would need to develop specialized vehicles, perhaps blimp-like crafts, capable of hovering miles above the scorching surface where temperatures are a comparatively cooler 170 degrees Fahrenheit.  Even at this altitude, robust thermal protection would be essential."}
{"text": "**Anuncia Hacienda reducción en las comisiones de las Afores**\n\nMéxico.- El secretario de Hacienda y Crédito Público (SHCP), Arturo Herrera, anunció este miércoles una resolución de la Comisión Nacional del Sistema de Ahorro para el Retiro (Consar) que establece la disminución de las comisiones que cobran las Afores.  Esta medida, publicada en el Diario Oficial de la Federación el 22 de agosto, busca acercar a México a los estándares internacionales.\n\nEn la conferencia de prensa matutina, Herrera explicó que la disminución será paulatina y se proyecta que para 2024 la comisión promedio llegue a 0.70%, según lo declarado por Abraham Vela, presidente de la Consar.  Esta reducción permitirá que los trabajadores reciban aproximadamente 10% más de pensión al momento de su retiro, comparado con lo que recibirían bajo el esquema actual.  Herrera destacó la importancia de las Afores, que manejan el 15.6% del PIB e invierten en proyectos de infraestructura. La Consar vigilará el descenso paulatino de las comisiones.\n\nEl sistema de contribución definida en México tiene actualmente el nivel de comisiones más alto en función del indicador comisión por administración como porcentaje del saldo.  Sistemas con más de 20 años de antigüedad, con la excepción de México, presentan niveles de comisión significativamente más bajos, demostrando que la antigüedad del sistema es un factor determinante en el nivel de las comisiones.\n\nEl presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador respaldó la medida y afirmó que los ahorros de los trabajadores están seguros: «No hay nada que temer, esas pensiones, esos ahorros, son sagrados».  Además, expresó su interés en que los trabajadores puedan incrementar sus ahorros sin que esto los afecte, buscando una pensión justa al final de su vida laboral.\n\nHacienda, en un comunicado, indicó que el acuerdo cuenta con el respaldo de todas las administradoras y que la disminución gradual y ordenada considera la situación particular de cada una.  El documento destaca que en los últimos 10 años el ahorro administrado por las Afores se ha triplicado, alcanzando 3.7 billones de pesos en julio, y se estima que supere los 9.4 billones para 2030.\n\nEsta iniciativa se alinea con las declaraciones previas de Herrera en octubre del año pasado, cuando manifestó la intención del gobierno de bajar las comisiones, considerando la alta comisión promedio del SAR (0.98%) y el impacto en los ahorros de los trabajadores.  En ese entonces, Abraham Vela Dib, presidente de la Consar, reveló la posibilidad de disminuir la comisión promedio de 0.98% a 0.90% para el año siguiente."}

He’d explained that it was simply his time to be dead, like the old days, when death was permanent. So, he kept himself dead as much as possible by immediately killing himself upon revival. Over the years, Katie had noticed that while Ed's body repaired itself and appeared functional, he’d become paler and more obsessed with maintaining his state of death.  Perhaps constant death was detrimental to his mental state. But Katie didn't dwell on it; Ed would be dead again in two minutes anyway.\n\nKatie almost made it home before remembering Donna's cat.  Those creatures, unlike humans, still died permanently if neglected.  With a sigh, she turned down an alley beside her house.\n\n\"To die or not to die!

{"text": "Driverless cars are rapidly approaching the horizon of everyday life, with multiple companies vying to perfect this autonomous technology.  While some have demonstrated impressive progress, the technology remains under development. This essay will explore both the potential benefits and drawbacks of driverless cars, ultimately culminating in my personal perspective on their role in our future.\n\nProponents of driverless cars envision a future with increased convenience and safety.  Imagine a world with reduced traffic congestion and fewer accidents, a world where commuting becomes productive time or simple relaxation.  Companies like Google have already made significant strides in developing autonomous vehicles, though a fully realized consumer version remains elusive.  The technological groundwork has been laid, suggesting widespread adoption is a matter of when, not if.\n\nHowever, the prospect of driverless cars raises several critical concerns.  While convenient, this technology could contribute to a more sedentary and dependent lifestyle.  Beyond the potential societal impact of increased inactivity, the question of liability in the event of an accident remains a complex legal and ethical dilemma.  Who is responsible in a crash: the owner, the manufacturer, or the software developer?  Furthermore, the reliability of technology is always a concern.  What happens when a system malfunctions, potentially leading to injury or even death?  The first major accident involving a driverless car will undoubtedly spark public outcry and potentially stall the progress of this technology.\n\nUltimately, I am skeptical of the benefits of driverless cars. While innovations like water-powered engines or enhanced safety features are welcomed advancements, autonomous driving feels like a step too far.  We live in a society increasingly reliant on technology, from smartphones to drones, and driverless cars seem to exacerbate this trend toward passivity. This dependence raises critical questions about the future of employment and the potential for widening socioeconomic disparities if access to this technology is limited.  For these reasons, I believe the focus should remain on improving existing transportation rather than pursuing fully autonomous vehicles."}

{"text": "Colin and Felicity were the proudest of parents. Little Rupert had been born in perfect health. They beamed at each other as the doctor transferred Rupert into the genetic coding chamber.\n\n\"Are you ready to program your son?\" the doctor asked with a smile.\n\nColin and Felicity exchanged a nod.  \"Yes,\" Felicity said, squeezing Colin's hand. \"Yes, we are.\"\n\nRupert lay within the gene manipulation chamber. The machine had eradicated genetic diseases overnight, allowing parents to select their newborns' traits. However, while harmful genes were automatically corrected, \"luxury alterations\" (as they were called) were subject to chance. Excessive population-wide perfection was deemed dangerous and undesirable by various governing bodies. Thus, parents rolled dice to determine their child's development.\n\n\"Okay,\" the doctor said, gesturing to a slot on the contraption, which resembled a vending machine. \"Collect the dice from here,\" he explained, pointing to another opening, \"and drop them in the slot up here. The machine will display the roll, which represents your child's ability in that specific area. Once you have the score, press 'next' here, and the dice will drop again.\" He chuckled. \"Any questions?\"\n\nColin glanced at Felicity. \"No,\" he said. \"I think we've got it, thanks.\"\n\n\"Then over to you,\" the doctor chirped.\n\nAlone in the room with his wife and child, Colin walked to the machine, placing his palm against the glass. Rupert already looked perfect. Felicity watched from the bed.\n\n\"What's the first trait?\" she asked excitedly.\n\n\"Beauty,\" Colin replied, retrieving the dice. \"Ready?\" he asked, looking back at Felicity.\n\n\"Yes, do it!\" she squealed.\n\nColin dropped the dice into the slot.  A click, a rattle, a gulp, and the digital display behind Rupert flashed a '6'.\n\n\"Yes!\" Colin shouted. \"Six out of six! Our kid's going to be a looker!\"\n\nThe parents celebrated, whooping, high-fiving, and hugging. After a minute or two, Colin pressed 'next' and collected the dice again.\n\nHe turned around, his face serious. Felicity's expression mirrored his concern.\n\n\"Is there a problem?\" she asked.\n\n\"This one is intelligence,\" Colin said soberly.\n\nFelicity gasped. \"Make sure you roll it well!\" she pleaded, clasping her hands in prayer.\n\nColin nodded and turned back to the machine. Exhaling deeply, he dropped the dice – click, rattle, gulp – and the machine displayed a '3'.\n\n\"What is it?\" Felicity cried.\n\n\"Three,\" Colin said.  Silence hung in the air.\n\nFelicity looked up, concentrating. \"You know, three isn't too bad, Colin.\"\n\nColin considered the score. \"No, I suppose not.\"\n\n\"After all,\" Felicity continued, \"Margaret told me Jerry's boy rolled low for intelligence!\"\n\n\"Jerry's boy?\" Colin said incredulously. \"He seems perfectly bright to me...\"\n\n\"Well, exactly!\" Felicity exclaimed. \"And our Rupert has a three! That's not even low! It's middle of the road!\"\n\n\"Middle of the road...\" Colin echoed, a sense of wonder in his voice. Suddenly pleased, he pressed 'next' with renewed optimism.\n\nA four followed for empathy, initially met with a cheer from Felicity and a dubious look from Colin. But, as Felicity pointed out, Jerry's boy had rolled low for empathy and was quite the unfeeling troublemaker. Colin's smile quickly returned."}
{"text": "Autonomous navigation has seen remarkable advancements, evident in the rise of self-driving cars and delivery robots.  However, significant challenges remain.  Classical planning methods, utilizing analytic optimization and reactive rules [1]-[3], offer safety and interpretability but often result in unnatural and inefficient behaviors with poor social norm compliance [4].  Conversely, machine learning approaches leveraging imitation learning [5], [6] and deep reinforcement learning [7]-[11] can capture nuanced human actions and improve environmental awareness.  However, these methods require extensive datasets, lack safety guarantees [12], and suffer from limited interpretability and transparency [13], leading to unpredictable failures [14], [15].\n\nThis work addresses these limitations by combining the strengths of classical and learning-based methods.  We introduce a sample-efficient learning strategy to enhance classical planners and a fallback system with a trained supervisor for guaranteed safety. Our approach offers a general framework for using learning to improve classical algorithms while retaining their advantages.\n\nSpecifically, we propose the following: 1) Train a planner using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with policy guidance from a classical planner.  This involves seeding the replay buffer with classical planner experiences and regularizing the actor in an actor-critic algorithm using the classical planner's policy. 2) Implement a classical rule-based navigation policy as a fallback and train a supervisor for minimal switching between the neural and classical planners to ensure safety.\n\nThis approach leverages existing classical algorithms for faster, improved convergence and uses a regularization term for stability and transparency, keeping the learning process close to the well-understood classical algorithm.  Furthermore, unlike methods relying on human demonstrations, ours requires no human involvement, as this is implicitly present in the classical algorithm's formulation and the reward function.\n\nOur main contribution is this combined approach, resulting in a sample-efficient learning strategy and a safety-guaranteed fallback mechanism.  While focusing on navigation planning, our methodology provides a broader recipe for integrating learning with classical algorithms.  The supervisor level ensures safety and transparency.\n\nRelevant code and videos are available at https://github.com/eliasgoldsztejn95. *(This work was supported by ISF Grant 1651/19, the Helmsley Charitable Trust through the ABC Robotics Center of Ben-Gurion University, and the Lynn and William Frankel Center for Computer Science.

{"text": "## Minimal Problems in Three-View Geometry Under Partial Visibility\n\nThis paper presents a complete classification of minimal problems for generic arrangements of points and lines in 3D space, observed partially by three calibrated perspective cameras. We focus on the case where each line is incident to at most one point (PL₁P).  This restriction simplifies the problem while remaining relevant to practical applications using features like SIFT [36] and LAF [37], which can be interpreted as points with attached lines [38].\n\nMinimal problems, essential for tasks like 3D reconstruction [24, 25, 26], image matching [27], and visual odometry [28, 29, 30, 31], involve recovering camera poses and world coordinates from images.  These problems are characterized by a finite positive number of solutions for random input instances.  While a complete characterization of minimal problems under full visibility exists [32], partial visibility, where occlusions and missed detections occur, presents a significantly more complex challenge.\n\nWe address this challenge for the three-view case with the PL₁P restriction. This allows us to manage the enumeration complexity while still encompassing practical scenarios.\n\n**Definition 1.** A point-line problem is defined by the tuple (p, l, I, O), representing p points and l lines with incidence relation I ⊂ {1, . . . , p} × {1, . . . , l}, and visibility in m views described by O = ((P₁, L₁), . . . , (Pm, Lm)).  (i, j) ∈ I indicates the i-th point lies on the j-th line. Pᵥ and Lᵥ specify the points and lines visible in view v.  We assume I is realizable in ℝ³ and complete (containing all implied incidences).  O is such that if a camera observes two intersecting lines according to I, it also observes their intersection point.\n\nAn instance of a point-line problem comprises a spatial point-line arrangement, a list of calibrated camera matrices (P₁, …, Pm), and the joint image projections. We aim to recover the arrangement and cameras from the given joint image.  The camera positions are assumed generic, ensuring points and lines are in general position regarding the incidences I.  We fix the coordinate system by setting P₁ = [I | 0] and the first coordinate of t₂ to 1 [52].\n\n**Definition 2.** A point-line problem is *minimal* if a generic image tuple has a non-zero, finite number of solutions.  This number, constant for generic images, is the problem's *degree*.\n\nOften, only camera poses are of interest.  A problem is *camera-minimal* if it has a finite, non-zero number of camera pose solutions for a generic image tuple. Minimal problems are camera-minimal, but not conversely (e.g., [35]). We further define *terminal camera-minimal* problems as the simplest camera-minimal problems obtained by removing superfluous features without losing camera-minimality.\n\n**Contribution.** We provide a complete classification of minimal PL₁P problems in three views. While infinitely many such problems exist, we reduce them to 140,616 equivalence classes of *reduced minimal problems* by removing superfluous features and relabeling cameras. Each class is described by its 3D incidence structure and feature visibility.  All problems within a class share the same algebraic degree.\n\nFurthermore, we identify 74,575 terminal camera-minimal problems, significantly expanding upon the 76 previously known cases [32, 35].  We list all terminal camera-minimal problems with fewer than 300 solutions and highlight other potentially practically relevant cases.\n\nTo achieve this, we define *reduced PL₁Ps* as canonical representatives of the minimal PL₁P classes."}

{"text": "The theory of stable matching, introduced by Gale and Shapley [GS62], has profoundly deepened our understanding of two-sided matching markets and inspired successful real-world market design.  Examples include marriage markets, online dating platforms, school choice programs, labor markets, and college admissions.  Using the common analogy of matching \"men\" to \"women,\" a matching is stable if no man-woman pair mutually prefers each other to their assigned partners.\n\nA fundamental challenge is characterizing the stable outcomes of these markets—predicting the results agents can expect based on market characteristics. Such characterizations are crucial not only for descriptive analysis but also for effective market design.  Numerous studies have examined stable matchings in random markets, where agents' preferences are drawn uniformly at random [Pit89, KMP90, AKL17, Pit19]. This paper extends these results to scenarios where preferences are shaped by \"public scores\" representing varying levels of attractiveness, thus generalizing the uniform case. We investigate how these public scores influence market outcomes.\n\nSpecifically, we analyze a class of tiered random markets with *n* men and *n* women. Each side is partitioned into a constant number of \"soft tiers.\"  A fraction *δᵢ* of men belong to tier *i* with public score *βᵢ*, and a fraction *γᵢ* of women belong to tier *i* with public score *αᵢ*. Each agent's complete preference list is generated by sampling without replacement, proportionally to the public scores of agents on the opposite side.  For instance, a man's preference list is constructed by sequentially sampling women, without replacement, based on a distribution proportional to their public scores.  Let *α* and *β* denote the vectors of scores and *γ* and *δ* denote the vectors of proportions for women and men, respectively. The marginal probability of selecting a woman in tier *i* is *αᵢ* / (*n* ⋅ *α* ⋅ *γ*), and an analogous statement holds for men. These preferences offer a natural progression beyond uniform distributions, introducing heterogeneity in agent quality while remaining amenable to theoretical analysis.\n\nOur primary objective is to analyze the average rank of agents within each tier under the man-optimal stable matching, focusing on asymptotic behavior in large markets. An agent's rank is the index of their partner on their preference list (lower is better).  We also examine the match type distribution—the fraction of tier *i* women matched to tier *j* men.\n\nFor sufficiently large markets, the following results hold within an arbitrarily small approximation factor:\n\n1."}

{"text": "Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), particularly those incorporating low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, are crucial for achieving ubiquitous connectivity [1], [2].  LEO satellites offer significant advantages over traditional MEO and GEO high-throughput satellites [6]-[8], including reduced propagation delays and lower deployment costs [3]-[5]. While current systems primarily connect ground stations (GSs) to individual satellites, leveraging multiple LEO satellites in coordinated swarms offers enhanced flexibility and scalability [9].\n\nA key advantage of satellite swarms lies in their ability to form large virtual antenna arrays, enabling substantial spectral efficiency gains through increased spatial separation [10]-[12].  However, implementing conventional MIMO schemes necessitates complete instantaneous channel state information (CSI) and inter-satellite coordination for joint beamforming.  This is impractical due to short channel coherence times caused by high orbital velocities and relatively long propagation delays in both ground-to-satellite and inter-satellite links.  This paper demonstrates that these limitations can be overcome by exploiting readily available or easily determined positional information instead of complete CSI.\n\nUsing this positional information, we develop an approximate channel model and derive a low-complexity, distributed linear precoder and equalizer based on beamspace MIMO [13], [14]. The precoder requires only knowledge of each satellite's own rotation and the position of itself and the GS, achieving near-optimal spectral efficiency.  Similarly, the equalizer relies solely on angle of arrival (AoA) information for the satellites, demonstrating near-optimal performance with proper swarm design.  We analytically determine the optimal swarm layout and numerically evaluate the overall system performance.\n\nExisting research on multi-satellite communication includes studies on downlink transmission from a large nano-satellite swarm to a single antenna GS, demonstrating significant array gain through in-phase signal combination at the GS [10].  Work in [15] explores communication between multiple satellites and a multi-antenna GS, using iterative interference cancellation to address spatial correlation between GEO satellites.  The capacity of multi-satellite systems is investigated in [16] and [17].  A distributed precoding algorithm based on the MMSE criterion and inter-satellite information exchange is proposed for multi-user downlink scenarios in [18].  Zero-forcing equalization at the ground terminal for reception from two satellites is explored in [11]. Finally, beamspace MIMO has been adapted to ground-to-satellite communication, primarily focusing on single satellite scenarios [19]-[21]."}

{"text": "Camilo Sesto, nombre artístico de Camilo Blanes Cortés (Alcoy, Alicante, 16 de septiembre de 1946), falleció a los 72 años. El cantante español había sido hospitalizado de urgencia por cálculos renales y un fuerte dolor lumbar en julio del año anterior.  Con una larga y exitosa carrera en España y Latinoamérica, publicó más de cuarenta discos y vendió más de 100 millones de copias a lo largo de su trayectoria.\n\nLa pintura fue una de las grandes aficiones de Blanes Cortés antes de formar el grupo \"Los Dayson\" con unos amigos, alcanzando cierto éxito en la provincia de Alicante.  Según su sitio web oficial, viajó a Madrid en 1964 con la maleta llena de ilusiones y la firme voluntad de triunfar. En aquella época, \"The Beatles\" causaban furor a nivel mundial, y a la sombra del cuarteto de Liverpool proliferaban numerosos grupos que intentaban emularlos.  Influenciado por ese ambiente de euforia musical, Camilo se integró en \"Los Botines\", un grupo que, si bien no alcanzó el éxito, le aportó una valiosa experiencia.  Tras la disolución de la banda, tuvo que empezar de cero. En octubre de 1970, con la ayuda y orientación de Juan Pardo, quien compuso sus dos primeras canciones, \"Buenas Noches\" y \"Lanza tu voz\", logró grabar su primer disco.  Este se grabó con Ariola, discográfica que por aquel entonces comenzaba su andadura en España, convirtiendo a Camilo en el primer artista español contratado por la compañía.\n\nEntre sus grandes éxitos se encuentran \"Pérdoname\", \"Donde estés, con quien estés\", \"Melina\" y \"Jamás\".\n\nLourdes Ornelas, madre del hijo de Camilo Sesto, confirmó el fallecimiento del cantante, quien mantenía una estrecha relación musical con México. Ornelas informó del deceso en España, aunque desconocía los detalles. La noticia la sorprendió mientras se encontraba en un centro comercial de la Ciudad de México, donde recibió la llamada del contador del artista, Cristóbal Hueto. \"Cuando me lo dijo no podía creerlo, me tomó desprevenida\", declaró.  En ese momento, su hijo aún desconocía la noticia, y Ornelas confesaba no saber cómo comunicarle el fallecimiento del cantante de 72 años, con quien Camilo Jr. mantenía una estrecha relación.\n\nOrnelas, distanciada del cantante desde hacía años, lamentó profundamente la pérdida, añadiendo que la música se vestía de luto una vez más con esta muerte tan inesperada.

Tras 22 años de presencia ininterrumpida en los Playoffs de la NBA (desde 1997),  los San Antonio Spurs no lograron clasificar entre los ocho primeros de la Conferencia Oeste en esta atípica temporada.  Esta marca representa el récord de más apariciones consecutivas en dicha instancia para una franquicia que cambió su historia desde la llegada de Gregg Popovich en 1996.\n\nLa eliminación de los Spurs no se definió por una derrota propia en la cancha, sino por la victoria de Milwaukee Bucks (1° del Este) sobre Memphis Grizzlies (8° del Oeste en ese momento).  Este resultado, sumado al triunfo de Phoenix Suns, dejó a la franquicia de Texas sin posibilidades matemáticas de alcanzar el octavo puesto.  A San Antonio le resta aún un último encuentro en esta temporada frente a Utah Jazz.\n\nSi bien nadie consideraba a los Spurs como candidatos al octavo lugar, Gregg Popovich, con un plantel limitado, logró una hazaña que los dejó a las puertas de los playoffs.  “Si me hubieran dicho antes de la reanudación que pelearíamos por los playoffs, hubiera pedido un test de drogas para el que me lo dijera”, comentó el coach de 71 años.\n\nPara dimensionar la magnitud del logro de Popovich en estos 22 años, basta con considerar que la última vez que los Spurs no jugaron los playoffs, Tim Duncan aún no había debutado en la NBA y el 35 por ciento de la población actual de San Antonio no había nacido.

{"text": "Understanding online privacy policies is challenging due to their length and complexity (Cranor et al., 2006).  Users often skim or ignore these dense documents, hindering informed consent.  This necessitates more user-friendly presentations that avoid cognitive fatigue and address specific user information needs (Doan et al., 2018; Wurman et al., 2001).  Previous work has explored various approaches to improve presentation, including: at-a-glance risk summaries (Tesfay et al., 2018; Zaeem et al., 2018), structured and color-coded risk overviews (Harkous et al., 2018; Nejad et al., 2019), and natural language summaries of risky practices (Manor and Li, 2019; Keymanesh et al., 2020).  However, these approaches often present a general overview, while users typically have specific concerns.\n\nA more user-centric approach is to allow users to ask questions about their specific concerns and receive targeted answers extracted from the policy (Ravichander et al., 2019a). This work focuses on building such an automated privacy policy question-answering assistant.  We propose a system that generates an extractive summary in response to user queries, similar to guided and controllable text summarization (Kryściński et al., 2019; Dang and Owczarzak, 2008; Keymanesh et al., 2021; Fan et al., 2017; Sarkhel et al., 2020) and reading comprehension (He et al., 2020).\n\nHowever, this task presents unique challenges. Users often ask questions that are irrelevant, out-of-scope (e.g., \"how many data breaches did you have?\"), subjective (e.g., \"how do I know this app is legit?\"), or too specific (e.g., \"does it have access to financial apps I use?\") (Ravichander et al., 2019a). Furthermore, even answerable questions often differ significantly in style and language from the formal legal language of privacy policies (Ravichander et al., 2019b), making it difficult to connect user intent with relevant policy content.  This domain shift is compounded by the limited size of existing annotated datasets (Ahmad et al., 2020), hindering purely supervised approaches.\n\nTo address these challenges, we employ query expansion and paraphrasing techniques, including lexical substitution and back-translation, to bridge the gap between user language and policy language. We then use a transformer-based language model, fine-tuned on in-domain data, to score the relevance and informativeness of each policy segment relative to the expanded query. Finally, we generate a summary from the top-scoring segments. Our results show that this hybrid approach allows us to extract relevant summaries for 89% of user queries in the PrivacyQA dataset."}

{"text": "The article \"Driveless Cars Are Coming\" presents arguments for and against the adoption of autonomous vehicles.  While the article features expert opinions from both car companies and scientists, the evidence presented leans heavily against the feasibility and safety of driverless technology.\n\nOne major concern is the cost.  As stated in paragraph 6, the sensors and other components required for autonomous driving inflate the manufacturing cost to a staggering two hundred million dollars.  This exorbitant price tag raises questions about accessibility and practicality.\n\nFurthermore, the claim that these cars are truly \"driverless\" is challenged in paragraph 7.  The article notes that while the car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, drivers are still required to keep their hands on the wheel due to touch sensors.  This requirement not only undermines the concept of a fully autonomous vehicle but also suggests that the high cost does not translate into a fully realized, hands-free driving experience.  It essentially begs the question: why pay such a premium for a feature that remains partially reliant on human intervention?\n\nThis reliance on human oversight also creates ambiguity regarding liability in the event of an accident.  If a collision occurs, determining fault becomes complex.  Is the manufacturer responsible, or does the onus fall on the driver who is expected to remain vigilant and ready to intervene?  This lack of clarity poses significant legal and ethical challenges.\n\nFinally, the article argues that despite the futuristic appeal of driverless cars, their current limitations make them impractical and potentially dangerous.

She led the Order of Light for six centuries, immortal since drinking from the fountain, her life dedicated to stopping the Dark One, the Bringer of Doom.  She’d never even met him, only been raised to believe in his destruction.  A thousand years of conflict culminated in the battle on the Golden Fields of Avalok.  Sophie, leading the last 10,000 free souls, rallied them with the cry, \"Today, we may die. But, we die as free folk.\"  She remembers the poison arrow, the darkness, and then, waking chained to a table in the Golden City, an orc tending her wounds.\n\n\nCaptured, but alive, Sophie, the veteran of countless victories and defeats, expected torture.

Fifty years since Sophie Drakeheart, ruthless warrior and tactless diplomat, learned the truth.  The plague ravaging the land, believed to be the Dark One's doing, was actually the work of a gruesome clan of Lizard Folk in the northern marshes.  Her first task as his advisor?  Exterminate them. She did, swiftly and brutally, ending the plague in months.\n\nThen came the rebuilding.  Orcish laborers, under the watchful eyes of the Dark One’s generals, repaired the ravaged cities with astonishing speed and efficiency. Order was restored, not through brutality, but through a fear that blossomed into trust, then love.  The Dark One, once the enemy, became the savior. Even the Order of Light, the very organization dedicated to his destruction, was honored with a memorial at Gurdan, its birthplace.

While the author effectively presents Venus's similarity to Earth, they fail to address the significant challenges and costs associated with such a venture.\n\nA major flaw in the original argument is the lack of discussion regarding the astronomical costs of a Venus mission.  The author glosses over this, likely because the expense of overcoming the immense obstacles—an average surface temperature exceeding 800 degrees Fahrenheit and atmospheric pressure 90 times that of Earth—far outweighs any perceived need for another planet.  These challenges would require significant financial investment to mitigate, a point not adequately explored.\n\nFurthermore, the author never establishes a compelling reason for comparing Venus to Earth.  While mentioning Venus as Earth's twin and suggesting the possibility of past life, they fail to articulate why this should be a primary concern. The text highlights the unsuccessful history of Venus exploration, noting that no spacecraft has survived on the surface for more than a few hours.

Le scrutin s’annonce très serré entre le président sortant, Muhammadu Buhari, du Congrès des progressistes (APC), et le chef de l’opposition, Atiku Abubakar, ancien vice-président et candidat du Parti populaire démocratique (PDP).\n\nÀ l’approche du vote, les deux candidats ont multiplié les meetings géants à travers les 37 États du pays, notamment à Lagos, la mégalopole économique, et Abuja, la capitale fédérale.  Les images de ces rassemblements, affichées fièrement sur les réseaux sociaux, ont alimenté une compétition acharnée, résumée par le titre du quotidien national *The Punch* : « PDP, APC : ‘Ma foule est plus grosse que la tienne’ ».  Pourtant, selon de nombreux experts, ces foules impressionnantes témoignent davantage du ralentissement économique et de la pauvreté ambiante que d’un réel engouement pour des candidats peu charismatiques.  Les meetings sont perçus comme une occasion de recevoir de l’argent, de la nourriture ou des cadeaux distribués par les équipes de campagne.\n\nLe Nigeria, géant d’Afrique, a plongé dans la récession entre 2016 et 2017, peu après l’arrivée au pouvoir de Muhammadu Buhari. La croissance peine à repartir et le pays détient désormais le triste record du plus grand nombre de personnes vivant dans l’extrême pauvreté (87 millions), devant l’Inde, selon le World Poverty Clock.  C’est sur ce terrain économique que l’opposant Atiku Abubakar axe sa campagne, promettant de « remettre le Nigeria au travail » (« Make Nigeria work again »).  Homme d’affaires prospère, il prône une politique libérale pour sortir le pays du marasme, contrastant avec l’interventionnisme de l’administration Buhari, qui a notamment fixé les taux de change et interdit certaines importations.  De son côté, Buhari se présente comme un homme proche du peuple, mettant en avant son programme de micro-crédit « Trader Moni », destiné à 2 millions de petits commerçants.\n\n« Buhari se positionne comme un homme d’État, pro-gouvernement, favorable à la nationalisation des services, tandis qu’Abubakar se présente comme pro-business, désireux d’encourager le secteur privé », analyse Cheta Nwanze, du cabinet SBM Intelligence à Lagos. « C’est une nouveauté dans notre pays. »  Traditionnellement, dans un Nigeria divisé par des clivages religieux (entre un Sud majoritairement chrétien et un Nord musulman) et ethniques (Haoussa, Yorouba et Igbo), le vote est souvent déterminé par l’origine régionale ou la religion du candidat.  Or, cette année, les deux principaux prétendants sont tous deux Haoussas et musulmans.  « Les résultats ne seront pas liés à une religion ou une ethnie », prédit Tanko Yakasi, ancien politicien de 93 ans. « Il n’y aura pas de sectarisme ou de tribalisme. Ce sera très serré, ou Atiku pourrait l’emporter. »\n\nÀ une semaine du scrutin, l’organisation d’élections libres et démocratiques représente un défi majeur pour ce pays aux infrastructures défaillantes, confronté à des problèmes d’accès à l’électricité et d’insécurité."}

{"text": "Recognizing vehicle occupants' faces in unconstrained environments, especially through the windshield, presents significant challenges.  Previous research demonstrates that windshield artifacts can severely degrade image quality within the vehicle interior.  Furthermore, images are often captured from a distance and at moderate speeds, reducing available light.  While low-intensity ultraviolet or near-infrared (NIR) illumination could help, tinted windshields, which are increasingly common, block these wavelengths, rendering such solutions ineffective.  Longer exposure times are also impractical due to vehicle motion, as the resulting motion blur significantly impairs face recognition quality.  Additionally, the reflective nature of windshields presents further complications. Reflections reduce light reaching the sensor and introduce unwanted artifacts, including obstructive glare from direct light sources (Figure 1) and superimposed reflections of other objects.\n\nExisting solutions, such as Gatekeeper Security's system, involve flashing visible lights at the driver.  This approach is problematic, creating both driver distraction and potential glare.\n\nTo address these challenges non-intrusively, we developed a custom multi-camera imaging system designed to optimize input for deep learning algorithms.  This modular system (Figures 2, 3, and 4) integrates imaging and computational components.  Raw images captured by the system can be processed using any High Dynamic Range (HDR) method to generate refined input for facial recognition software. This paper extends previous work in two key ways. First, we created and annotated a new dataset to train HDR reconstruction models specifically optimized for our hardware. Second, we introduce a novel HDR reconstruction network architecture, MU-Net (Mertens-Unrolled Network), which uses an unrolling technique to model the Mertens-Kautz-Van Reeth HDR algorithm as a neural network.  Finally, to evaluate the end-to-end system performance, we utilize state-of-the-art (SOTA) facial detection and recognition algorithms to assess image capture and HDR reconstruction quality for detecting and identifying faces through windshields of moving vehicles. We also benchmark MU-Net's efficacy against other established classical and deep learning-based HDR methods within the same recognition pipeline."}
{"text": "Driverless cars are poised to revolutionize the automotive industry, offering significant advantages over traditional vehicles.  After reading an article on the subject, I'm convinced that these vehicles will be incredibly helpful and useful in the future.  The article highlighted several key benefits, including increased safety, reduced driver burden, and improved navigation.\n\nOne major advantage is the potential for increased safety.  Driverless cars, like those developed by Google, have demonstrated the ability to drive up to half a million miles before being involved in a crash.  This remarkable feat is a testament to the advanced technology that allows these cars to avoid accidents far more effectively than human drivers.  Human error is a leading cause of accidents, and driverless cars promise to drastically reduce accidents by eliminating this factor.\n\nFurthermore, driverless cars significantly reduce the burden on the driver.  Since these cars handle the driving 90% of the time, drivers are free to focus on other tasks, whether it's catching up on work, ensuring their children are safe, or simply relaxing.  While the driver may still need to intervene 10% of the time, the vast majority of the driving experience becomes automated, freeing up the driver's attention and reducing stress.\n\nNavigation is another area where driverless cars excel.  Integrated GPS systems allow drivers to input their destination without the distraction of manipulating a separate device. The car automatically navigates the route, eliminating the worry of getting lost or being late. This feature is particularly beneficial for those who are not confident in their navigation skills or frequently travel to unfamiliar locations.\n\nIn conclusion, driverless cars offer a compelling vision of the future of transportation. By handling the majority of the driving tasks, these vehicles enhance safety, reduce driver stress, and simplify navigation.  The ability to drive for extended periods without incident, coupled with the convenience of automated navigation, makes a strong case for the success and widespread adoption of driverless cars."}

{"text": "The upcoming super-middleweight title clash between Chris Eubank Jr. and George Groves promises to be a 2018 highlight, a potential 12-round classic.  Beyond the excitement of Eubank Jr.’s inherited self-belief and blinding hand speed, this fight represents a pivotal moment in the younger Eubank’s career.  As Dr. Samuel Johnson, the great man of letters, wrote nearly 300 years ago: “There must always be a struggle between father and son, while one aims at power and the other at independence.” This struggle is embodied in the Eubanks.\n\nChris Eubank Sr., a former illustrious double world champion, has been a constant, arguably overbearing, presence in his son’s career.  Much like a Svengali, he has dominated and monitored almost every move his son has made, both inside and outside the ring.  This fight offers Eubank Jr., at 28, the chance to step out of his father's shadow and forge his own identity. He acknowledges this, stating his desire to be recognized as Chris Eubank, not simply Chris Eubank Jr.  A victory over Groves would be a significant step in that direction.\n\nWhile Eubank Jr. enters the fight as a surprising favorite, endorsed by a 20-10 margin in a Boxing Monthly poll of British professionals, Groves, the reigning WBA super-middleweight champion, presents a formidable challenge.  Groves, making his third title defense, will need his sharp jab and honed defensive skills to weather the early-round onslaught expected from Eubank Jr.  Although Eubank Jr. boasts impressive speed and confidence, his opponents, with the exception of Billy Joe Saunders (who defeated him on points), haven't been of the same caliber as those Groves has faced.\n\nI question Eubank Jr.'s power at this weight.  He might have been better suited staying at middleweight. I doubt he possesses the power to seriously trouble the top super-middleweights.  While Groves has suffered two losses to Carl Froch, including a brutal knockout in their second bout, his size advantage in this fight could be decisive.\n\nContrary to popular opinion, I believe Groves’s counter-punching and precise timing will carry him to a close but clear points victory.  His size and experience against top-tier competition will ultimately prove too much for Eubank Jr. to overcome.  This fight isn't just about a title; it's about a son's fight for independence and recognition in his own right."}

{"text": "The \"Face on Mars\" is a fascinating example of how perception can trick us.  A 1976 image of a Martian mesa, taken by the Viking 1 orbiter, appeared to some as a face, sparking speculation about alien civilizations.  However, this resemblance is purely coincidental, a trick of light and shadow captured by a relatively low-resolution camera.  Subsequent images taken in 2001 with significantly improved technology confirmed the formation to be a natural geological feature, a mesa, not unlike those found on Earth.\n\nJust as a random chip might resemble a face or clouds might mimic animals, the initial \"Face on Mars\" image invited pareidolia—the tendency to see meaningful patterns in random data.  We often have to look twice at something to confirm what we think we see, highlighting the difference between perception and reality.  Magic tricks, for instance, create illusions that appear real but are based on deception. Similarly, the \"face\" on Mars was an illusion created by the limitations of the early imaging technology.\n\nThe argument for alien construction of the \"face\" lacks evidence.  It's akin to claiming humans built the Grand Canyon or the Rocky Mountains.  These natural formations are products of geological processes, just like the mesa on Mars.  Without proof of alien existence, let alone their involvement, the natural explanation, supported by clear photographic evidence, remains the most plausible.\n\nThe idea of aliens sculpting this Martian mesa is ultimately a circular argument.  While speculation is intriguing, it lacks the factual basis that readily supports the geological explanation. The \"Face on Mars\" serves as a reminder that while initial appearances can be deceiving, a closer look, informed by better data, often reveals a simpler, more grounded truth."}

{"text": "The digital landscape has transformed drastically since the era of mainframes. Your company, like many others, has ridden each wave of technological advancement, from minis and microcomputers to the PC revolution, the dot-com boom with Sparcs, and the rise of databases like DB2, Oracle, and SQL Server. You embraced MPP, explored data cubes, and transitioned data to the intranet and internet.  VMware promised to control server sprawl, yet VM sprawl emerged. SharePoint became a fixture, and the allure of SaaS led you from Siebel to Salesforce.\n\nNow, you're drowning in data. Your mainframe is a fragile relic, your SAN a costly black box offering little insight due to rampant VM and application sprawl.  Millennials advocate for \"webscale\" solutions like MongoDB, while Hadoop vendors promise magical insights from data lakes, introducing yet another storage technology to manage.\n\nEnough is enough. This year, regain control of your data.  Here are 12 resolutions to guide your data strategy:\n\n1. **Catalog Your Data:**  Knowing what data you possess is the first step. A comprehensive data mapping system is helpful, but the crucial element is a dedicated effort to locate and document all your data assets.\n\n2. **Map Data Use:** Understand how your data is used by applications and its flow within the organization. Tracking data lineage and dependency, whether through software or manual effort, is vital.  Identify why data is kept, who uses it, and for what purpose. Define the data, its source system, and its usage.\n\n3. **Understand Data Creation:**  Just as NASA’s reliance on incomplete data led to critical errors, understanding your data's origins is crucial. How are numbers derived?  This is an ongoing process, as new data sources constantly emerge, but it's essential for preventing avoidable disasters.\n\n4. **Understand Data Flow:**  Mapping your organization’s data circulatory system—a comprehensive data flow diagram—is essential. This reveals inefficiencies (\"black holes\" and \"miracles\"), redundancies, and opportunities for optimization.  It also highlights where similar processes differ solely by technology stack, allowing for standardization.\n\n5. **Automate Manual Processes:** Manual data manipulation in spreadsheets introduces latency and errors. By mapping your data flow, you can identify these manual processes and automate them, improving efficiency and accuracy.\n\n6. **Embrace Machine Learning:**  Machine learning isn't magic, but it can automate pattern recognition and analysis. Identify at least one business process where machine learning can provide a demonstrable advantage. This is a practical step towards leveraging the power of data.\n\n7. **Prioritize Natural Language and Voice Search:**  The future of data interaction is natural language and voice.  Making your data accessible through these modalities is no longer a luxury but a necessity to cater to evolving user expectations.\n\n8. **Embrace Web Accessibility:**  Shift away from cumbersome desktop software.  Web-based applications offer greater flexibility, easier maintenance, and accessibility from anywhere.\n\n9. **Prioritize Mobile Accessibility:**  Desktop computing is declining.  Ensure your data and applications are accessible on mobile devices to support the increasingly mobile workforce.\n\n10. **Ensure High Availability and Distributability:**  Resilience is key.  Modern distributed databases designed for the cloud offer better uptime, scalability, and more affordable disaster recovery than traditional solutions.\n\n11. **Consolidate Systems:** Simplify your IT infrastructure by consolidating redundant systems. This reduces complexity, maintenance costs, and improves overall efficiency.  While the business case may be challenging, the long-term benefits are significant.\n\n12. **Visualize Data:**  Charts and visualizations make data more accessible and understandable.  Leverage visualization tools to communicate insights effectively.\n\n\nBy adopting these resolutions, you can transform IT from a cost center to a strategic asset, building a data-driven future for your organization."}

La mayoría de los lotes presentan un estado de bueno a excelente.  Las lluvias registradas durante aproximadamente 20 días revirtieron la sequía y los primeros síntomas de déficit hídrico, generando un escenario favorable para el crecimiento y desarrollo normal de los cultivos, según informó el Sistema de Estimaciones Agrícolas de la Bolsa de Comercio de Santa Fe.  Tanto la floración como la etapa reproductiva comenzaron con buena a muy buena disponibilidad de agua en el suelo.  No se detectaron plagas ni enfermedades.  Persiste la presencia de sorgo de alepo ( *Sorghum halepense* ) en algunos lotes, debido a que la sequía previa dificultó los controles, aunque las últimas lluvias permitieron retomarlos.\n\n**Trigo: cosecha al 78%**\n\nLa cosecha de trigo alcanzó el 78% de avance, abarcando aproximadamente 271.830 hectáreas, con un progreso del 10% en la última semana.  Los rendimientos se mantienen heterogéneos e irregulares, consolidando la caída previamente informada. Se estima un rendimiento promedio de 17 a 18 qq/ha en el centro-norte provincial para la campaña 2020, una disminución de 16 a 17 qq/ha respecto al ciclo anterior (34,25 qq/ha).  Las parcelas aún sin cosechar presentan un importante crecimiento de malezas debido a las lluvias. Se evalúa su recolección y, mientras tanto, se realizan aplicaciones de herbicidas para control y facilitar la eventual trilla o la implantación de otro cultivo.\n\n**Girasol en buen estado general**\n\nTras los días inestables, el girasol continúa su ciclo con normalidad, mostrando un buen estado general gracias a la humedad del suelo que permite un desarrollo adecuado. Los lotes previamente afectados por el estrés hídrico presentan plantas menos desarrolladas, con capítulos de menor tamaño.  Se observa buena sanidad, aunque en lotes más avanzados, en etapa de fructificación, persisten los daños por palomas y cotorras.\n\n**Algodón: 80% de implantación**\n\nEl algodón mantiene un crecimiento y desarrollo adecuados, con buena humedad en el suelo.  Los pocos lotes afectados por el temporal que no logren recuperarse cambiarán su destino. El estado general de los cultivos es de bueno a muy bueno, con un stand de plantas adecuado. La implantación alcanzó el 80%, cubriendo 40.800 hectáreas sobre una intención de siembra de 51.000 ha, un avance del 10% en la última semana.  Continúa el monitoreo de trampas y la prevención del picudo, con aplicaciones en los bordes según necesidad.\n\n**Soja tardía: 25% de avance en la siembra**\n\nLa siembra de soja tardía avanzó al 25%, cubriendo 137.500 hectáreas, manteniendo un buen ritmo gracias a la humedad del suelo.  Se estima una intención de siembra de 550.000 hectáreas, un 2% superior a la campaña 2019/2020 (538.500 ha). Los primeros lotes implantados muestran buena germinación y emergencia, y se están realizando aplicaciones de herbicidas post-emergentes para el control de malezas."}

Have you ever woken up to that? No? Well, it’s… unsettling.  Let’s just say it startled me.\n\nThe giant head sniffed the air. “Oh my god, did you really just shit yourself?! AHAHA!”\n\nSo, here's another question: Have you ever been mocked by a giant floating head for an accident it *caused*? I’m going to assume you haven’t.\n\n“WHAAGGHFUCK,” I sputtered, still trying to process the situation.\n\nThe head, if it could, would have been doubled over with laughter. “Oh man, this is great.”\n\nMortified, I scrambled to the bathroom, clutching my backside as the head roared with laughter.  I cleaned up as best I could and wrapped a towel around myself. The head, meanwhile, had drifted over to my TV, poking around with what I can only describe as ethereal curiosity. It turned its attention back to me.\n\n“I didn’t realize the human race was so inferior that they actually based their lives around technology! I mean look at this thing.

Now *this* is an impressive app. Facebook! That sounds right up my alley.”\n\nThe giant head spent the next few hours laughing and posting on my Facebook profile.\n\n“Look, Captain Head. Didn’t you have an important mission?”\n\n“Not now! Someone is wrong on the internet! I must inform them of this!”\n\nI sighed. At this rate, he’d stumble onto the darker corners of the internet."}

Snapchat allows users to send photos and videos that automatically disappear after a few seconds.\n\nSnapchat stated that its users were \"allegedly victimized by their use of third-party apps to send and receive Snaps, a practice expressly prohibited in our terms of use precisely because it compromises user security.\"\n\nA Snapchat representative noted that the company's statement was based solely on media reports of the leaked photos.  The company could not verify whether hackers had actually breached any third-party software containing stolen Snapchat photos.\n\nSnapchat is particularly popular with teenagers, and some media reports expressed concern that the hackers' file could contain nude \"selfie\" pictures of teens who believed the photos would be deleted shortly after being sent.\n\nReuters could not verify whether any Snapchat photos were posted online.\n\nAccording to Business Insider, hackers may have obtained the photos by breaching the servers of third-party services that allow users to save Snapchat photos.  The report indicated that users of the online file-sharing forum 4Chan had downloaded the files and were creating a searchable database of the stolen photos.\n\nThe leaked photos could be particularly damaging for Snapchat, a privately held company already facing criticism for its privacy practices.  The company is currently in the process of raising funds in a round that media reports suggest would value it at $10 billion.\n\nThis potential release of private Snapchat photos follows shortly after nude pictures of actress Jennifer Lawrence and images purportedly of dozens of other female actresses were posted on 4Chan.  Media reports attributed those leaks to hacked Apple iCloud accounts.\n\nLos Angeles-based Snapchat is among a new wave of popular mobile apps competing with established internet services like Twitter and Facebook.\n\nIn May, Snapchat settled charges with U.S. regulators who accused the company of deceiving customers by promising that photos on its service disappeared permanently.  The Federal Trade Commission stated that Snapchat photos could be saved by recipients using various methods.\n\n(Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic; editing by Matthew Lewis)"}

{"text": "The idea of driverless cars presents both intriguing advantages and serious concerns. While the technology offers potential benefits, significant safety issues remain to be addressed.\n\nOn the positive side, driverless cars could offer increased convenience.  Commuters could relax, catch up on work, or even retrieve dropped items without the stress of managing the vehicle.  The ability to multitask during a commute could be particularly appealing for busy individuals.  Furthermore, in theory, driverless cars could mitigate the risks associated with human error, such as distracted or impaired driving.\n\nHowever, the safety and reliability of these vehicles are still in question.  What happens if the communication system fails and the driver is not alerted to take control?  The possibility of a system malfunction leading to loss of control is a serious concern.  Furthermore, dependence on technology raises questions about cybersecurity vulnerabilities and the potential for hacking or malicious control.\n\nMy personal reservations stem from these safety uncertainties.  I would feel uncomfortable relinquishing control to a computer, especially with others in the vehicle.  While proponents may argue that driverless cars have a clean accident record, this doesn't guarantee future safety.  Unforeseen circumstances, software glitches, or hardware failures could lead to accidents.  The reliance on charging also introduces the possibility of power failures leaving drivers stranded.\n\nUltimately, while the concept of driverless cars offers a futuristic vision of transportation,  I remain skeptical.  The potential risks and unresolved safety concerns outweigh the perceived conveniences, at least for now.  Until these issues are adequately addressed, I would be hesitant to embrace this technology."}
{"text": "Blockchain technologies have recently garnered significant attention due to their decentralized and scalable nature. Bitcoin and Ethereum are prominent examples. Bitcoin, a blockchain-based cryptocurrency system introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 [1, 2], facilitates trading via a peer-to-peer network secured with SHA-256 encryption.  Every node participating in the blockchain stores all transactions in a Merkle tree data structure. Bitcoin addresses the double-spending problem using a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm for block generation. Ethereum, a distributed computing platform based on blockchain developed by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, also stores all transactions on every node, similar to Bitcoin. However, Ethereum extends functionality beyond cryptocurrency trading by enabling the execution of applications on the blockchain using smart contracts. This versatility allows Ethereum to be applied across various domains, including social networking, email, and gaming.\n\nThis paper introduces Koa, a new programming language designed to simplify the development of scalable blockchain systems. Koa addresses the challenges posed by Bitcoin's script language, which, due to its low-level instruction-based nature, hinders code comprehension and analysis.  The sequential nature of the script language makes it difficult to grasp code flow. Implementing complex logic is also cumbersome. For instance, expressing conditional branching in the script language lacks clear delineation between the condition evaluation, true execution path, and false execution path.  Furthermore, the purpose of individual instructions can be obscure. The verification process, which involves sequentially executing unlocking and locking scripts, is difficult to interpret semantically.  Implementing scripts also requires careful management of the stack, adding further complexity.  Koa, with its function definitions, provides clear semantic units, enhancing readability. While verifying a value in script might require defining a new instruction or assembling numerous instructions, Koa simplifies this process by using a combination of supported operators. Consequently, Koa offers improved readability and ease of use compared to script languages.\n\nSolidity, the smart contract language for Ethereum, introduces the concept of \"gas,\" a transaction fee mechanism used to prevent infinite loop attacks.  However, gas adds complexity to Solidity code and impacts usability.  Furthermore, Ethereum's statefulness complicates static analysis of Solidity code.  The state-dependent nature of function execution makes gas consumption prediction challenging.  In contrast, Koa's stateless nature facilitates static analysis.  The absence of state-dependent code branches and loops simplifies code analysis and inherently prevents infinite loop attacks.  This allows for predictable cost estimation in Koa.  Therefore, Koa, as a high-level language, empowers programmers to develop blockchain applications more quickly and efficiently.\n\n\n*Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

A year later, I enlisted in the army.\n\nBeing a Seagoing Cowboy was hard work.  During the crossings, we cared for the animals day and night, hauling heavy bags of oats and hay and watering them two or three times a day.  It was demanding, but also a valuable experience. By the time I was discharged in 1947, I had completed nine trips – more than anyone else!\n\nDespite the hard work, there were plenty of good times. After delivering the animals, we'd use their stalls for games like baseball, volleyball, table tennis, boxing, fencing, and even whittling.\n\nAll that hard work and time paid off in the form of incredible travel opportunities.  I saw the Acropolis in Greece, experienced the wonders of Europe and China, rode a gondola through the watery streets of Venice, Italy, explored an excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.\n\nMy experience as a Seagoing Cowboy was unforgettable.  To any young people considering this unique opportunity, I highly recommend it.  You might have similar experiences to mine, or perhaps you'll journey to even bigger and better places than I ever dreamed of."}
{"text": "Driverless cars offer significant potential benefits, warranting continued research and development. Their promise lies in enhanced safety, increased efficiency, and a less intensive driving experience.\n\nSafety is a paramount concern, and driverless cars offer several advantages in this area.  Many current vehicles, both driverless and those with drivers, incorporate features designed to detect and respond to traffic hazards.  For instance, as highlighted later, BMW is developing a car with advanced steering, acceleration, and braking capabilities. While not yet fully autonomous, these developments pave the way for a future where driverless cars can significantly reduce accidents.  Furthermore, the potential for driverless cars to communicate with each other via GPS could prevent collisions by enabling them to anticipate and avoid each other's movements.\n\nEfficiency is another key benefit.  A driverless car equipped with GPS could identify the fastest and most fuel-efficient routes, optimizing travel time and resource consumption.  Moreover, sophisticated onboard computers could make real-time decisions about fuel conservation, such as determining whether to turn off the engine during idle periods.  These \"smart\" systems could also minimize wear and tear on components like brakes and tires by calculating optimal braking distances and durations.\n\nFinally, driverless cars could revolutionize the driving experience itself.  Current drivers must maintain constant vigilance and awareness of their surroundings.  However, with the advanced safety features discussed earlier, driverless cars could alleviate this burden, allowing drivers to focus on other tasks or passengers, thereby reducing stress and fatigue."}
{"text": "Driverless cars, once a futuristic fantasy, are rapidly becoming a reality. Companies like Google, active in this field since 2009, and BMW are pushing the boundaries of autonomous driving technology.  This exciting development, however, raises crucial questions.  Is relinquishing control to a machine truly the best course of action?  Could it create more problems than it solves?  These critical questions demand careful consideration.\n\nOne key concern revolves around safety and liability.  BMW's \"Traffic Jam Assistant,\" developed in 2013, allows vehicles to handle driving functions up to 25 mph.  However, even in these limited circumstances, the driver must remain vigilant and ready to intervene.  In complex situations like work zones or accidents, human control remains essential.  Consider a pedestrian unexpectedly crossing the street: a human driver can react instinctively, while an autonomous vehicle might struggle to process the unpredictable human element, potentially leading to an accident.  The current legal framework assigns blame based on who initiates a collision.  If an autonomous vehicle is involved, determining liability becomes complex.  Is the driver at fault, or is the supposedly infallible machine to blame?  Entrusting a machine with human lives requires careful consideration beyond the allure of convenience.\n\nThe financial and experiential costs are also significant.  Over-reliance on autonomous vehicles could erode driving skills, leaving drivers less alert and less capable of handling unexpected situations.  While some argue that warning signals prompt drivers to retake control, the time allowed may be insufficient to fully assess and react to complex scenarios. This poses a particular danger to new drivers.  Furthermore, the \"cars of the future\" come with a hefty price tag, offering only partial autonomy at exorbitant cost.\n\nLooking further down the road, widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles would necessitate a complete overhaul of our current infrastructure.  Replacing existing roads with \"smart roads\" is a monumental undertaking, both in terms of time and expense.  While proponents tout the safety benefits of autonomous vehicles, the reality is that software and sensor failures can occur.  No one wants to be injured or killed due to an error by a driverless car.\n\nWhile autonomous vehicles offer potential benefits, such as reduced fuel consumption and potentially improved traffic flow, these advantages must be weighed against the considerable challenges.  The transition to a driverless future requires careful consideration of safety, liability, cost, and infrastructure.  Only then can we determine whether the human or the car will ultimately take the wheel. The development of driverless cars continues, but their widespread adoption hinges on addressing these critical issues and developing solutions that outweigh the potential problems. It remains to be seen whether these vehicles will live up to their promise or become another costly technological experiment."}

Si bien es un porcentaje pequeño, constituye un buen modelo de estudio \"cuyos resultados pueden extrapolarse a la variante más común\".  La importancia de estudiar estos pacientes radica en que \"el desarrollo de la enfermedad es estereotipado y previsible, a diferencia de los casos esporádicos\", destacaron los especialistas.\n\n\"Cada hijo de un progenitor con ADAD tiene un 50% de probabilidad de heredar la mutación.  Si la hereda, desarrollará Alzheimer aproximadamente a la misma edad que su progenitor, casi siempre antes de los 60 años\", explicó Allegri.\n\nEl biomarcador que puede anticipar la enfermedad dos décadas es el amiloide (A), detectable mediante PET cerebral con marcación amiloide (PiB) y la medición de Aβ42 en líquido cefalorraquídeo. Otros marcadores, con una anticipación de diez años, son la medición de fosfo-tau en líquido cefalorraquídeo y el PET cerebral con marcación tau.\n\nEstudios epidemiológicos en América Latina indican que el Alzheimer es el tipo de demencia más frecuente. En Argentina, se estima que cerca de 600 mil personas viven con la enfermedad, más de 20 mil de ellas menores de 65 años.  La OMS proyecta que el número de afectados se cuadruplicará entre 2015 y 2050.\n\n\"La población latinoamericana envejece rápidamente, y la edad es el mayor factor de riesgo.

Traditional systems typically rely on optical flow algorithms [18, 59, 60], but these methods struggle with large motions or occlusions [19] due to their limited temporal context, relying only on a few neighboring frames.  Lately, point tracking methods [16, 17, 22, 33, 72] have emerged as a promising alternative, often capable of tracking points across numerous frames, even with occlusions, maintaining over 50% of initial queries after thousands of frames [72].  However, the computational cost of tracking every pixel individually has hindered their widespread adoption as a replacement for optical flow.\n\nThis inefficiency stems from the independent processing of individual tracks [16, 17, 22, 72].  Furthermore, as highlighted by Karaev et al. [33] in their CoTracker approach, tracking points independently neglects valuable spatial context.  While CoTracker tracks multiple points together to leverage trajectory correlations, performance can suffer when the number of simultaneous tracks becomes excessive, limiting the feasibility of achieving both speed and accuracy.\n\nOur work addresses these limitations.  We introduce DOT (Figure 1), a novel approach that bridges the gap between optical flow and point tracking, combining the spatial coherence of the former with the temporal consistency of the latter.  From a small set of tracks (represented in white), DOT predicts dense motions (visualized with distinct colors) and occlusions (shown with stripes) between arbitrary frames.\n\nOur contributions are threefold:\n\n* We propose DOT, a simple and efficient method that unifies point tracking and optical flow.  It uses a sparse set of tracks to predict dense flow fields and visibility masks between any two frames.\n* We expand the CVO benchmark [64] with 500 new videos containing longer sequences and higher frame rates to present more challenging motion scenarios and better evaluate dense, long-term tracking.\n* Extensive experiments on the CVO and TAP benchmarks [16, 64], with quantitative and qualitative results, demonstrate that DOT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art optical flow methods, achieves performance on par with or better than leading point tracking algorithms, and offers a substantial speed advantage (×100) for dense prediction."}

{"text": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are the state-of-the-art approach to molecular property prediction (Duvenaud et al., 2015; Gilmer et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019). A GNN operates on a molecule's graph structure in two phases: a message passing phase, where a molecular representation is learned by exchanging messages between atom or bond states, and a readout phase, where a feed forward network (FFN) converts this representation into a prediction.\n\nThe specific challenges of molecular property prediction align well with the potential advantages of Bayesian learning.  In cheminformatics, generalization is hampered by the concept of a molecular scaffold – the core structure to which functional groups attach. Highly parameterized GNNs are prone to overfitting to training scaffolds, resulting in a poor molecular representation and hindering generalization to test data (Yang et al., 2019).  Furthermore, models risk producing overconfident predictions on new scaffolds, masking the uncertainty inherent in exploring new chemical spaces. This poorly quantified uncertainty makes it difficult to evaluate model robustness and applicability to out-of-domain data (Hirschfeld et al., 2020).  We believe Bayesian modeling offers the best solution to these challenges. Unlike classical neural networks that commit to a single hypothesis, a Bayesian approach constructs a predictive distribution by considering all possible parameter settings.  Bayesian marginalization can improve both the calibration (Maddox et al., 2019) and accuracy (Izmailov et al., 2019) of deep neural networks trained on limited data.\n\n\nRelated work has explored these issues.  Hirschfeld et al. (2020) benchmarked uncertainty quantification methods for molecular property prediction using the same GNN architecture we employ. While they found no consistently superior method, replacing the readout phase with a Gaussian process (GP) or random forest yielded reasonable performance."}
{"text": "Fashion, a cornerstone of human experience, has burgeoned into a multi-hundred-billion-dollar industry in the US alone.  The rise of online shopping has fueled a demand for sophisticated fashion-understanding systems, particularly for outfit recommendation.  Recent years have witnessed significant progress in fashion-related research, encompassing clothing attribute prediction, landmark detection [11, 21], fashion recommendation [5, 8, 24], clothing item retrieval [10, 22], clothing parsing [1, 4], and outfit recommendation [2, 7, 12, 19].\n\nThis paper focuses on outfit recommendation. An outfit comprises items from various fine-grained categories (e.g., sweater, jeans, boots, school bag) that exhibit visual aesthetic harmony.  Effective outfit recommendation necessitates learning compatibility [2, 3, 13, 19, 20]—how multiple visual items interact—rather than simply identifying similarity between individual items.\n\nExisting outfit recommendation approaches fall into three main categories.  The first [7, 13] treats an outfit as a set, training a binary classifier to determine outfit compatibility based on concatenated item features (Figure 1a).  Due to the limitations of simple concatenation in modeling inter-item relationships, this approach generally yields the poorest performance.  The second [3, 20] minimizes the sum of distances between all item pairs in a compatibility space (Figure 1b).  This approach often suffers from the \"ill-triangle\" problem: two incompatible items might be deemed compatible if both are compatible with a third item. While an extension [19] incorporates \"type\" information, it requires learning type embedding matrices for every type pair, incurring an inefficient O(n²) time complexity for *n* clothing types.  The third approach [2, 14] treats an outfit as a predefined item sequence (Figure 1c), modeling compatibility with an order-dependent LSTM.  Performance degrades significantly when the outfit order changes.  Furthermore, existing systems often prioritize visual aesthetics and metadata like item descriptions. While useful for describing image features, this metadata is less effective for compatibility learning.  Coarse category information (e.g., tops, bottoms, shoes) is used to define sequential outfits [2, 14], with each timestep corresponding to a predefined coarse category.  Training solely on coarse or fine categories lacks flexibility, as a query item's category might be coarse while the model is trained on fine categories.  The literature lacks consideration for both category types.  To meet customer needs, both fine-grained and coarse categories are essential. For example, two customers with the same T-shirt might prefer different pants (jeans or sweatpants) rather than simply a \"bottom.\"  Conversely, a customer with a T-shirt might desire any type of \"bottom.\"  To incorporate both category types into compatibility learning and enhance recommendation flexibility, we introduce the concept of a *tuple*: a fashion item paired with its category (coarse or fine).  Consequently, we extend item compatibility learning to tuple compatibility learning.\n\nTo facilitate tuple compatibility learning and address existing limitations, we propose the Mixed Category Attention Net (MCAN). MCAN treats an outfit as a combination of item-category tuples and learns their compatibility.  Given a partial tuple sequence, MCAN predicts the next item via an integrated Item Prediction Layer (IPL). If the next category is specified, the predicted item will belong to that category; otherwise, a Category Prediction Layer (CPL) predicts the next category. By incorporating category sequences, MCAN offers versatile recommendation capabilities."}

{"text": "Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a new technology designed to identify emotions. Developed by Dr. Paul Ekman, FACS classifies six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.  Each emotion is associated with characteristic facial muscle movements.\n\nThis technology is now being implemented in schools. A classroom computer equipped with FACS could recognize when a student is confused or bored, then modify the lesson, much like an effective human instructor.  This application seems promising for students who are hesitant to communicate with their teachers.  However, there are potential downsides.\n\nOne concern is the possibility of the computer misinterpreting a student's facial expressions, leading to the delivery of incorrect or irrelevant information.  The cost of implementing such technology is also a significant factor.  Perhaps the most serious concern is the potential displacement of teachers.  If a computer can effectively instruct students, the need for human educators might be questioned, leading to job losses for those who have dedicated their careers to teaching.\n\nOn the positive side, FACS could enhance learning, particularly for students who are withdrawn or quiet in class.  These students might benefit from a computer's ability to personalize instruction based on their emotional responses.  Just as online advertising algorithms adapt to user reactions – displaying similar ads after a smile, and different ones after a frown – FACS could tailor lessons to a student's emotional state. This allows for a real-time understanding of the student's feelings.\n\nUltimately, FACS presents both advantages and disadvantages.  While the long-term benefits might include improved learning outcomes and potentially more intelligent students, the short-term consequences could be disruptive. Students might become less socially adept due to decreased interaction with teachers, and educators could face unemployment.  Balancing the potential educational gains with the societal impact on teachers will be crucial as this technology develops."}

{"text": "The Android app market is facing increasing competition.  According to Statista [1], the number of available apps decreased in 2019 for the first time, suggesting that many apps are being removed due to obsolescence or lack of user interest.  To remain competitive, apps must continuously monitor user preferences and demands, often collecting user and device information during execution.  Much of this information, such as GPS location, contact lists, and device IMEI, is privacy-sensitive, raising concerns among both corporate and personal users [1, 2].  Recent data breaches, like the Peekaboo Moments incident exposing over 100 GB of baby photos and videos [2], further highlight these risks.\n\nTo address these privacy concerns, mobile apps should adhere to the principle of minimal data collection, accessing only the personal and sensitive information (PSI) strictly necessary to provide their service.  Furthermore, they must clearly disclose what PSI is accessed.  Google has attempted to mitigate these privacy issues by releasing a set of privacy guidelines for Android apps [3] outlining technical and legal requirements for data collection, use, and sharing, emphasizing user consent and transparency.  Consequently, apps on the Google Play Store requiring PSI access must have a readily accessible, in-app privacy policy detailing their data practices, which users must acknowledge before granting access.\n\nDespite these guidelines, a key challenge remains:  a comprehensive methodology for assessing app compliance is currently lacking.  It remains unclear how many apps genuinely adhere to Google Play's privacy guidelines, highlighting a critical research gap."}

However, I'm here to debunk this myth with concrete evidence.  I have a friend at NASA, and even he agrees with the scientific consensus.\n\nThe first blow to the alien theory came in April 1998.  The Mars Global Surveyor, equipped with a high-resolution camera, flew over Cydonia, the region where the \"Face\" is located. The resulting image was ten times sharper than the original 1976 photograph.  To the surprise of many, but not me, it revealed a natural landform, not an alien monument.  Skeptics argued that the 1998 photo was taken during a cloudy Martian season, potentially obscuring the \"truth.\"\n\nTo address this, another photograph was taken on April 8, 2001, during a clear summer day in Cydonia.  The Mars Global Surveyor’s camera captured incredible detail, with each pixel representing only 1.56 meters.  Even small objects like planes or shacks would have been visible.

{"text": "Visual odometry (VO), or visual egomotion estimation, is a well-studied topic with a rich history [1].  One of the known difficulties with monocular VO, however, is its inability to resolve the true scale of the scene relative to a known reference.  Consequently, both estimated scene depths and the estimated distance travelled between adjacent image frames are determined only up to an unknown, and often drifting, scale factor. While simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms can mitigate scale drift through loop closure detection, extreme drift can prevent loop closure and lead to irreversible errors in map building [2].\n\nExisting techniques often attempt to resolve this scale ambiguity by incorporating a priori scene information, such as known object sizes or camera height, into classical VO algorithms [3].  However, this hand-engineering approach presents significant tuning challenges.  An alternative is data-driven learning, where neural networks map directly from raw image pairs to inter-frame egomotion predictions. With ground truth labels like depths or poses, these networks can produce metrically-scaled outputs [4]-[6].  Unfortunately, acquiring such ground truth labels is often onerous and expensive, limiting training data.  Moreover, the lack of ground truth at test time prevents online retraining with newly-collected data, hindering long-term autonomy, especially since learning-based systems can be unreliable outside their training distribution [7].\n\nTo address these limitations, self-supervised methods have been proposed, jointly training depth and egomotion networks without ground truth labels [8]. These methods typically employ a photometric reconstruction loss during training.  However, despite significant advancements in self-supervised learning, network outputs often remain unscaled due to the absence of metric information during training.\n\nOur work introduces a novel scale recovery loss that resolves this issue by ensuring consistency between the estimated and known camera height above the ground plane. This approach injects metric information during training, leading to metrically-scaled depth and egomotion predictions at test time.  To facilitate this, we extract the ground plane from each training image and determine its normal and offset (camera height) using a least squares technique.  Importantly, unlike existing scale recovery methods [9], our approach does not require ground plane segmentation at test time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first self-supervised, learning-based system capable of producing scaled depth and egomotion estimates using only monocular images during training."}

Analicemos:\n\n**Primero:** Una vez conocida la situación, fue notoria la voluntad de Uribe de rendir versión ante la Corte. Sin embargo, esta audiencia de versión libre no fue permitida, ya que los magistrados guardaron silencio e hicieron caso omiso a la voluntad de colaboración de Uribe, vulnerando, sin justificación alguna, sus derechos fundamentales al debido proceso y a la defensa.\n\n¿Cómo es posible que los magistrados, en un asunto de extrema delicadeza, no permitan una audiencia de versión libre, pero posteriormente citen a indagatoria al implicado con una medida implícita de aseguramiento?  Da la impresión de que, independientemente de la versión de Uribe, la Corte ya tenía una decisión preconcebida, lo que podría interpretarse como un prejuzgamiento.

{"text": "The rapid proliferation of mobile devices and wireless technology has led to an explosive growth in mobile data traffic.  While major network operators have upgraded their cellular networks to 5G, network capacity growth still lags significantly behind the increasing demand for data (e.g., [1], [2]).  WiFi, a mature short-range wireless technology, offers a relatively low-cost and easily deployable solution for congestion control. However, individual WiFi access points (APs), even with the latest gigabit WiFi amendments in 802.11ac/ad/ax, have limited coverage.  Deploying a ubiquitous WiFi network remains challenging due to the prohibitive cost of achieving comprehensive coverage [3].\n\nCrowdsourced WiFi community networks have emerged as a promising approach to address the coverage limitations of traditional WiFi.  Non-traditional service providers like Fon and OpenSpark are developing WiFi sharing platforms that aggregate numerous home WiFi APs to provide expanded coverage for their users.  These networks operate on an equal-reciprocal principle, incentivizing users to share their home APs in exchange for access to the APs of other users. Fon, for example, boasts a network of over 23 million APs and is rapidly expanding globally, particularly in densely populated areas where 5G networks often face congestion, especially during peak hours.  Despite the significant coverage gains achieved by aggregating individual APs, crowdsourced WiFi networks still fall short of ubiquitous 5G coverage and are therefore considered a complementary backhaul service rather than a replacement.\n\nThis coexistence of 5G and crowdsourced WiFi networks is evident in numerous partnerships, such as British Telecom and Fon in the United Kingdom, and Telenor and OpenSpark in Finland (e.g., [4], [5]).  The convergence of the negative externalities of 5G network congestion with the positive externalities of crowdsourced WiFi raises important questions.  Does a 5G network operator benefit from the introduction of a crowdsourced WiFi network by a separate, self-interested company? How should the 5G operator adapt its service operation, particularly its pricing strategy, in response?  What is the impact on user payoffs given the availability of a complementary WiFi service option?\n\nAddressing these questions from an economic perspective presents two key technical challenges."}

{"text": "The increasing complexity of geometries in various fields demands robust solvers.  These complex shapes arise in applications ranging from everyday scenarios like the behavior of electrical wires [1] and the electro-elasticity of components [2] to understanding elastic shock in solids [3].  Biomedical and biomechanical applications involving human organs, as well as AI-generated geometries coupled with these fields, further highlight this need.  Moreover, materials ranging from polymers to biological tissues exhibit incompressible or nearly incompressible behavior, posing additional challenges.\n\nTraditional finite element formulations in solid dynamics, where displacement is the primary unknown and other quantities are post-processed [4] [5], perform poorly near the incompressibility limit.  These methods suffer from locking, spurious pressure fields, and limitations in bending applications [6].  Several techniques, including selective and reduced integration methods like B-bar [6] [7] [8], F-bar [9] [10] [11] [12], and mean dilatation methods [13], address these issues by reducing the order of incompressibility at quadrature points, thus circumventing numerical instabilities related to the inf-sup or LBB conditions [14]. While effective for structured quadrilateral and hexahedral meshes, these strategies are hampered by the high cost of hexahedral mesh generation for complex geometries.  Unstructured tetrahedral elements offer a more efficient alternative.\n\nThe similarity between the elliptic equation governing static, incompressible elasticity and the Stokes problem in fluid mechanics, and the analogous hyperbolic equation for transient elastodynamics, suggests extending mixed/coupled velocity/pressure formulations from fluid mechanics [15] to mixed displacement/pressure formulations in solid mechanics [16].  This approach has been explored for incompressible linear elastic materials using the Orthogonal Sub Scale (OSS) method [17], and for non-linear materials [19] [20], demonstrating the capabilities of mixed displacement/pressure and strain/displacement or stress/displacement formulations.  Three-field (displacement/pressure/strain) formulations have also shown promise in the near-incompressible limit [21].\n\nHowever, extending these formulations to transient elastodynamics, which introduces a hyperbolic character, presents further challenges.  Several approaches address this by introducing additional variables, such as the deformation tensor F [22] [23] [24] [25] and Lagrange multipliers.  For incompressible and bending-dominated problems, the Jacobian determinant of the deformation gradient J [26] [27] or the nodal co-factor tensor H [28] [29] [30] are sometimes introduced, often requiring stabilization techniques like SUPG.  Other methods utilize mixed velocity/pressure formulations with displacement derived from velocity discretization, sometimes employing pressure rate equations to handle the hyperbolic nature of the transient case [31] [32].  Mixed displacement/pressure formulations within a total Lagrangian framework, using variations of the VMS method, have also proven effective [33].\n\nThis paper proposes a novel mixed displacement/pressure formulation for non-linear elasticity in solid dynamics using unstructured tetrahedral meshes, allowing for efficient representation of complex geometries.  Building upon the concept of splitting strain energy into deviatoric and volumetric parts [35], the method solves a constitutive equation in pressure and employs a fully implicit, mixed coupled formulation in an updated Lagrangian context.  A VMS-based stabilization technique mitigates spurious pressure fields.  The following sections detail the problem definition (Section 2), the stabilized linear elastic formulation for steady-state and transient cases (Section 3), the stabilized hyperelastic formulation (Section 4), numerical validation (Section 5), and conclusions and perspectives (Section 6)."}

{"text": "The pursuit of knowledge discovery is a cornerstone of human progress, driving innovation and shaping our understanding of the world [30, 28].  As Margaret Drabble eloquently stated, \"When nothing is sure, everything is possible.\" This sentiment resonates deeply with the challenges and opportunities present in modern scientific discovery.  While traditionally, hypothesis formulation has been the intellectual anchor steering scientific investigation [13], the exponential growth of data and literature [28] coupled with disciplinary silos has created a bottleneck in this crucial process.  This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to revolutionize knowledge discovery by addressing these challenges and unlocking new possibilities, particularly in hypothesis generation.\n\nCentral to this exploration is the observation that while existing tools excel at hypothesis validation, there's a glaring gap in methods for generating novel hypotheses [42, 31, 1, 38].  This paper addresses this gap by investigating the capacity of LLMs to generate hypotheses in zero-shot scenarios, a largely unexplored area.  Previous research has touched upon problem discovery, but lacks rigorous experimental designs specifically targeting zero-shot hypothesis generation by LLMs.\n\nTo address this, we constructed a temporal biomedical dataset spanning January 2000 to September 2023, partitioned into training (pre-January 2023) and testing (August 2023) sets. This ensures the evaluated LLMs (trained on pre-August 2023 corpora) are genuinely tested on unseen data.  We also developed a multi-intelligent collaborative framework incorporating search tools and role-playing to enhance the potential for hypothesis generation. Figure 1 illustrates an example of a generated hypothesis using the fine-tuned 65B LLaMA within our dataset, remarkably aligning with existing literature.  This underscores the potential of LLMs and highlights the need for tools and methodologies that facilitate hypothesis generation [13].\n\n3. Can LLMs Truly Generate Zero-Shot Hypotheses?\n\nThis section details our methodology for evaluating the zero-shot hypothesis generation capabilities of LLMs.  We define the problem of zero-shot hypothesis generation, describe the construction of our biomedical dataset, and outline the experiments conducted to assess various instructed models across multiple dimensions, exploring factors influencing their ability to propose novel hypotheses.\n\nOur experiments, analyzed in Figure 1, yielded surprising results: 1) LLMs generated untrained yet validated hypotheses when tested against recent literature. 2) Increased uncertainty, introduced through methods like multi-agent collaboration, enhanced zero-shot hypothesis generation.  However, subsequent few-shot enhancements and the use of additional tools sometimes *reduced* the model's proficiency, likely by constraining the hypothesis generation space. This highlights the need for careful consideration when incorporating external knowledge. This observation reinforces Drabble's quote – greater uncertainty can unlock greater possibility.\n\nOur contributions are threefold:\n\n1) We constructed a temporal biomedical instruction dataset and designed novel experiments to rigorously evaluate the zero-shot and few-shot hypothesis generation potential of LLMs, a first in the field.\n2) Through multi-faceted evaluations, we demonstrated that LLMs possess rudimentary higher-order reasoning capabilities and can generate novel hypotheses, providing new insights and pathways for knowledge discovery.\n3) We developed a four-dimensional metric for evaluating generated hypotheses, using both ChatGPT and human evaluations.  The strong correlation between these evaluations further highlights the utility of LLMs in this process.\n\nScientific discovery relies on several key components: data analysis, hypothesis formulation, experiment design, execution, observation, and reflection [13], as illustrated in Figure 2.  While all are essential, hypothesis formulation plays a pivotal role, guiding the entire research process.  Our research demonstrates the potential of LLMs to become valuable tools in this crucial stage, potentially ushering in a new era of efficiency and innovation in knowledge discovery.\n\nBackground Knowledge for Hypothesis Generation Example:\n\n(1) Esophageal cancer primarily comprises squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, each with distinct risk factors and incidence rates.\n(2) Metformin has been shown to reduce the risk of various cancers in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).\n(3) Existing research on the relationship between metformin use and esophageal cancer risk presents conflicting results.\n\nHypothesized by the Model:\n\n(1) Metformin use in T2DM patients may be associated with a reduced risk of esophageal cancer.\n(2) The correlation between metformin use and esophageal cancer risk may differ between male and female T2DM patients. (This hypothesis is supported by a 2023 study titled 'Diabetes, metformin use, and survival in esophageal cancer: a population-based cohort study'.)\n\nThe challenge of data traceability in pre-trained models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 limits the exploration of zero-shot hypothesis generation.  Our approach, using a temporally defined dataset and rigorous testing methodology, addresses this limitation and provides valuable insights into the untapped potential of LLMs in scientific discovery."}

Durante este periodo, generó residuos que depositó principalmente en los vertederos de Sardas y Bailín.  Toda la superficie de la antigua factoría ha sido declarada suelo contaminado, superando los niveles genéricos de referencia del Real Decreto 9/2005,  y estas declaraciones se han inscrito en el Registro de la Propiedad.

Esta actuación, declarada de utilidad pública e interés social por el Gobierno de Aragón, se dividirá en dos fases: el derribo de los edificios y la caracterización del suelo del interior de las naves para su posterior descontaminación.\n\nParadójicamente, el único acceso rodado a la antigua factoría es un camino privado dentro de un complejo industrial, considerado \"Infraestructura crítica\" por la Secretaria General de Seguridad del Estado.  Esta circunstancia genera demoras en la tramitación de los permisos individuales y diarios para su uso.  Para agilizar las labores de seguimiento y control de la ruina industrial, se ha considerado necesaria la construcción de un nuevo vial sin restricciones de uso.\n\nEl nuevo vial, de 593 metros de longitud, permitirá el acceso desde la calle Cañada Real.  El proyecto incluye la construcción de conducciones de agua y energía eléctrica para futuras instalaciones de mantenimiento, descontaminación y control, así como el encauzamiento de las aguas pluviales de los alrededores.  En una fase posterior, estas aguas se derivarán a una depuradora móvil para su descontaminación.\n\nSe prevé concluir la expropiación de los 13.000 metros cuadrados necesarios para el nuevo vial en 2021 y construirlo en 2023.  Este vial, consensuado con los técnicos del Ayuntamiento de Sabiñánigo, se integrará en el entramado urbano de la capital del Alto Gállego una vez finalizadas las actuaciones.

{"text": "Chargers’ preseason opener, a 48-17 loss to the Seattle Seahawks Sunday night, was marred by a potentially serious injury to starting middle linebacker Denzel Perryman.  Perryman hurt his left ankle in the first quarter and was later seen on crutches and in a walking boot. He underwent an MRI on Monday, but the team has yet to release a medical update.  “I’m not sure how bad it is right now, we’ll have to wait and see,” coach Anthony Lynn said after the game. “It could be serious, but I have no idea right now.” This injury comes on the heels of two other significant blows to the Chargers. Projected starting right guard Forrest Lamp, a second-round pick from Western Kentucky, tore his ACL in the first week of training camp and is out for the season.  First-round pick Mike Williams, a wide receiver from Clemson, is also sidelined with a herniated disk in his lower back suffered in May.  There is no timetable for his return.\n\nPerryman, a 24-year-old second-round pick from Miami in 2015, recorded 80 tackles, two sacks and an interception in 12 games last season, starting 11. He missed four games due to hamstring and knee injuries. As a rookie in 2015, he tallied 95 tackles and two sacks in 14 games.  If Perryman’s injury is significant, it will likely elevate reserve middle linebacker Korey Toomer into the starting lineup.  Toomer, who had four tackles Sunday night, played in 13 games with eight starts last season, recording 69 tackles and one sack.\n\nDespite the loss and the injury, there were some bright spots for the Chargers. The first-team offense orchestrated an impressive game-opening, 13-play, 75-yard touchdown drive.  Quarterback Philip Rivers completed five of six passes for 56 yards and emerged without a speck of dirt on his uniform. “We kept Philip clean,” left guard Matt Slauson said. “He was getting the ball out fast. We ran the ball well. Everything was rolling. Communication was fast and clean. Nobody was really unsure.” The strong play of the revamped offensive line, which will feature at least three new starters, is crucial to the Chargers’ success given the talent at the skill positions with Rivers, running back Melvin Gordon, and a deep group of receivers and tight ends.\n\nThe drive included a 17-yard completion to tight end Hunter Henry, a 15-yard catch by Travis Benjamin on third-and-nine, and a 14-yard screen pass to Branden Oliver.  The drive culminated in a five-yard touchdown pass to veteran tight end Antonio Gates. “When you have a guy like Philip, a guy who understands the system, understands the game, he puts you in the best position possible,” Gates said. “That’s what he was able to do. We were so efficient. Our whole thing is trying to be balanced, and we were able to do that.”\n\nThe Chargers' first-team defense also performed well initially, preventing Seattle from scoring on its first two possessions.  Cornerback Casey Hayward provided tight coverage, and defensive end Melvin Ingram stopped quarterback Trevone Boykin for no gain.  However, the second- and third-team units struggled against Seattle’s reserves. “We’re going to be a good team, but it’s not just about the ones,” safety Tre Boston said. “Unfortunately in football, your ones will go down every so often, and we need twos and threes who are going to pick up the slack and help us.”\n\nBackup quarterback candidate Cardale Jones, recently acquired from Buffalo, displayed flashes of potential, including a 38-yard completion to tight end Matt Weiser and a 13-yard scramble.  However, he completed only two of nine passes for 50 yards and took an 11-yard sack.  “He’s still learning our system,” Lynn said. “We threw him in the fire, and he did some good things, but he also did some bad things, things he needs to improve on — his accuracy, some reads, some protections.”\n\n\n**(Remove all extraneous captions and irrelevant material about McGregor, Mayweather, and the Rams.)**"}

{"text": "Edgar’s Story: A Revised Narrative\n\nMy name is Edgar. I was a person once.\n\nI remember the chilling metallic touch of the cage bars against my trembling body. The dripping sink down the hall, a metronome marking the time until they came for me. The sound echoed in the stark silence, broken only by the frantic thump of my own heart.  I’d known this day was coming, always known, yet nothing could have truly prepared me.  A naive part of me had clung to the hope of being overlooked, spared.\n\nGrowing up, they fed us stories: work hard, prove your worth, and earn Pilgrim status, a valued member of society.  I wish they’d just told me it was bullshit.  All that work, all that striving, for nothing.  My father was a Breeder, a Pilgrim granted the privilege of creating new Shells.  Perhaps foolishly, I thought his position might offer me some protection, some connection.  But he was already gone, moved on before I even had a chance to know him.  I hadn't seen him since I was a child. Lying in bed at night, I used to wonder what it felt like to burn through bodies the way he did.\n\nFootsteps in the hall. The dripping stopped. This was it.  A bone-deep dread seized me, my teeth chattering against the rising tide of fear.  The guards arrived, restrained me.  Resistance was futile; I’d always been weak, and now, a weary acceptance had settled in.\n\nThe walk seemed endless, a procession past the cells of others awaiting the same fate – their bodies repurposed.  Some wept, some raged; I pitied them. Not all could face the inevitable with the same grim resignation I had somehow mustered.\n\nWe passed through a gate, the guards nodding to a man holding a key before a large laboratory door. Its pristine white finish clashed violently with the rusted metal and crumbling concrete of the surrounding area.  Inside, all eyes turned to me.  My 25th birthday party, a macabre celebration I never wanted.  They strapped me to a chair, drew blood, confirmed I wasn't brain-dead.  The silence was the most terrifying part."}
{"text": "Topic models (TMs), such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), reveal the thematic structure of document collections by identifying latent topics and their association with each document.  These models represent documents as mixtures of topics, where each topic is a distribution over words in the vocabulary.  Beyond document representation, TMs offer interpretability through the top key terms associated with each topic.  Recent neural topic models (NTMs) have demonstrated superior performance compared to LDA-based approaches, motivating our focus on NTMs in this work.\n\nLanguage models (LMs) excel at predicting words within sequences, effectively capturing local linguistic structures like word order. However, traditional LMs, often limited by n-gram windows or sentence boundaries, struggle to incorporate global semantic context, particularly at the document level.  Recent research has sought to bridge this gap by integrating document-level semantics from topic models into LMs, for instance, by augmenting LSTM-based LMs with document-topic proportions.\n\nExisting approaches, while incorporating document-topic proportions into LMs, overlook the valuable explanatory power of the individual topics themselves.  This explanatory representation, derived from the high-probability terms within each topic's word distribution, offers a finer-grained understanding of the thematic content. Consider the example in Figure 1(a): a topic model applied to a three-sentence document reveals the document-topic proportions (ĥd) and the top key terms for each corresponding topic (T1, T2, and T3).  The context of \"chip\" in sentence #2 is ambiguous, but the document-topic proportions combined with the explanatory topics provide both an abstract (latent) and detailed perspective, clarifying the meaning.  This combined approach of augmenting LMs with both document-topic proportions *and* explanatory topics remains unexplored, to the best of our knowledge.\n\nTherefore, our first contribution is a novel Neural Composite Language Modeling (NCLM) framework. This framework integrates both latent document-topic proportions and explanatory topics into LMs, leveraging a NTM and a NLM.  This approach complements the latent representation with topic-specific term distributions, enriching the semantic context available to the language model.\n\n\n**(Figure 1(a) should be placed here)**\n\n**(Footnote 1 should be placed after the first mention of LDA or at the bottom of the page)**"}

As one article poses, \"Who is at fault, the driver or the manufacturer?\" This ambiguity could lead to considerable legal disputes.

This lack of situational awareness is highlighted in a passage stating that these vehicles \"are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills.\" This clearly demonstrates that driverless cars cannot handle all situations and pose a significant accident risk.  The same passage questions the practicality of a driverless car that still requires a driver.\n\nThe question of liability in the event of an accident with a driverless car is complex.

{"text": "Deep learning models excel at many challenging tasks in static environments [9, 38].  However, their performance degrades significantly in dynamically changing environments with sequentially arriving novel tasks, where humans maintain a clear advantage.  Confronted with such sequences, these models suffer from catastrophic forgetting, retaining knowledge primarily of the most recent task. Continual learning aims to address this by enabling models to continuously learn and adapt to new environments, leveraging past knowledge without succumbing to forgetting.\n\nTwo prominent continual learning settings are Task-Incremental Learning (TIL) and Class-Incremental Learning (CIL).  TIL provides task identifiers during both training and inference, while CIL offers them only during training.  Current literature explores three primary approaches to continual learning: replay-based, regularization-based, and expansion-based methods.\n\nReplay-based methods [32, 33, 50] demonstrate promising results by storing and replaying a subset of previous task samples. However, this approach raises privacy concerns, increases storage and training costs, and can bias learning towards the current task due to limited replay samples.  Regularization-based methods [1, 4, 15] mitigate catastrophic forgetting by regularizing parameters learned from previous tasks. While they offer a solution, their effectiveness is often sub-optimal and limited to shorter task sequences.  Expansion-based methods [35, 51, 52, 58] hold potential for handling longer task sequences, but efficient expansion and task prediction remain critical bottlenecks. Consequently, most existing models operate within the simpler TIL setting, relying on task identifiers during inference.  Recent advancements [40, 44, 47] introduce efficient expansion-based models, yet they often underutilize previously learned parameters by fine-tuning expansion parameters for each new task. This limits knowledge transfer primarily to the current task, resulting in suboptimal knowledge retention.  Furthermore, these approaches often assume uniform task complexity, leading to uniform parameter growth, which fails to account for the diverse complexity of real-world tasks.  Task prediction in expansion-based approaches also presents a significant challenge, with performance degrading rapidly as the number of tasks increases.\n\nThis work introduces a simple, highly efficient filter and channel expansion-based model applicable to any convolutional network.  By fully utilizing previously learned information, our model facilitates superior knowledge transfer."}

{"text": "Drug discovery is a lengthy and costly process, taking an average of 12 years and $1.8 billion to bring a new drug to market (Arrowsmith, 2011; Pammolli et al., 2019).  The central challenge is designing molecules with specific biological activity on a therapeutic target, while also possessing the necessary properties to become a drug.  Scientists employ a combination of experimental and computational methods to identify such compounds (Eckert & Bajorath, 2007; Xu & Hagler, 2002).  To reduce the time and cost, machine learning is increasingly used to guide the discovery process (Chen et al., 2018; Gilmer et al., 2017).  A common application is predicting a compound's activity on a given target based on its structural or physio-chemical properties, a technique known as quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling (Tropsha, 2010). QSAR models can also guide generative algorithms in designing compounds with optimized properties (Bengio et al., 2021; Blaschke et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2022).\n\n**The Low-Data Regime:** Training these models requires data from wet lab experiments, which is scarce and expensive to generate.  Datasets for novel targets are often limited to a few hundred molecules.  This scarcity has led to the exploration of few-shot learning approaches, with meta-learning emerging as a prominent solution (Altae-Tran et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2023; Schimunek et al., 2023).\n\n**Meta-Learning:** Meta-learning methods are pre-trained to \"learn to learn\" from limited labeled examples (a support set), conditioning their predictions directly on this set (Vinyals et al., 2016).  This approach requires maintaining separate pre-trained models for few-shot and standard classification tasks.  Furthermore, meta-learning algorithms often require specific training procedures mirroring the test-time scenario. This control over the training process can be problematic in black-box settings, where model access is limited to predictions via an API (Ji et al., 2021; Ouali et al., 2023).  Such restrictions hinder the use of meta-learning in drug discovery, where data sensitivity often necessitates black-box models to protect confidential datasets and pre-trained models."}

{"text": "Distributed optimization has gained significant attention in the last decade, driven by the increasing demands of distributed signal processing and massive data processing over peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. This approach involves formulating an optimization problem from data distributed across devices and then iteratively spreading and fusing information across the network until a global solution is reached. Applications range from training machine learning models and target tracking to healthcare monitoring, power grid management, and environmental sensing.\n\nHowever, distributed optimization, particularly in ad-hoc networks, faces several challenges. These include the lack of infrastructure, limited connectivity, scalability issues, data heterogeneity, data privacy requirements, and heterogeneous computational resources [3], [4].  Various methods have been proposed to address these challenges, depending on the specific application.  For example, pairwise gossip methods [5], [6] enable asynchronous message exchange, while others combine gossip with geographic routing [7].  Broadcast-based methods [8] aim to conserve communication energy.  Alternative approaches include belief propagation/message passing [9], [10] and signal processing on graphs [11], [12], [13].  Distributed optimization over directed graphs has also been explored [14]. Federated learning [15], [16], a specialized form of distributed optimization, focuses on collaborative model training over centralized server-client networks.\n\nThis work focuses on distributed signal processing through its connection with convex optimization, leveraging the fact that many classical signal processing problems can be reformulated in a convex form [17]. We model the problem as a convex optimization problem and utilize standard solvers such as dual ascent, the method of multipliers, ADMM [2], and PDMM [18], [19].  While ADMM and PDMM appear different due to their derivations, they are closely related [19].  PDMM's derivation, however, naturally leads to a distributed implementation without requiring direct collaboration between nodes during updates. Therefore, we adopt the PDMM approach to derive update rules for distributed optimization with linear equality and inequality constraints.\n\nPDMM was initially developed for solving separable convex optimization problems: minimize  ∑_(i∈V) f_i(x_i) subject to constraints, in a synchronous setting over a P2P network represented by an undirected graph G = (V, E).  Recent research [20] demonstrates that PDMM can also be implemented asynchronously and is resilient to transmission losses.  Its application to federated learning over centralized networks [21] reveals close relationships with SCAFFOLD [16] and FedSplit [22]."}

Add to this the floating clouds of corrosive sulfuric acid, and it becomes clear why no spacecraft has survived on the surface for more than a few hours.  This unforgiving environment is further punctuated by erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes.  It's no wonder no human has ever attempted a landing.\n\nHowever, beneath this hostile exterior lies a fascinating history.  Scientists believe Venus once possessed oceans and may have even supported life.  Its surface, though ravaged, still retains diverse geological features, including valleys, mountains, and craters.  These remnants of a potentially habitable past fuel scientific curiosity and drive the desire to understand Venus's evolution."}

Ho confirmed to The Sun News that the photo is weeks old, taken on December 12th at a Jericho March in Washington, D.C. He provided a screenshot from Angeli's now-deleted Facebook page showing the timestamp and explained that Angeli requested the photo after Ho spoke at the event.  \"I have no connection with this guy,\" Ho stated.\n\nHo, who announced his mayoral candidacy last year, was in Washington D.C. on Wednesday for the rally supporting Trump and protesting the Electoral College win for President-Elect Joe Biden. He said he was shocked by the violence that erupted at the Capitol. \"I was shocked at what was going on cause it was peaceful [until then],\" he commented.\n\nOn Thursday, as the photo went viral, Ho addressed the issue on Facebook, reiterating that the picture was old and predated the riot. He also posted on Wednesday regarding his views on the rally and the subsequent mob.  His Facebook post on Thursday began: \"Hello friends. There is a picture going around on social media of me with 'the Viking' - the guy that broke into the...\"\n\nHo emphasized that his mayoral campaign is founded on principles of positivity and nonviolence, contrasting sharply with the images of destruction and chaos from inside the Capitol, where Angeli, dressed in Viking-like gear, was photographed among rioters who breached the building, smashed windows, and forced Congress to evacuate."}
{"text": "The Annual Culling loomed, a mere nineteen days away. Clyde Castillo knew the rules: rise to the top of the Crime list or be culled, executed in the night alongside every other registered criminal who failed to make the cut.  The Culling ensured only the best criminals survived, those destined to become Hunters, tasked with eliminating their lesser counterparts to maintain their precarious position on the Most Wanted list.\n\nClyde wasn’t supposed to be here. His first theft, a few weeks prior, was driven by desperation, a need for food in a world where sustenance was harder to come by than the jewels and electronics that littered the malls of the Sector’s wealthy elite.  He knew that life, the life of the Zones and Wards, the life of the middle class and the poor. He’d lived it for far too long.  But now, stealing was his only path to survival.\n\nHe threw the bag of loot, his latest haul, into the stolen car. Each robbery brought him closer to his goal, closer to the top, and closer to the attention of the Hunters.  He knew the risks. He knew they were watching.  He just hoped he could climb high enough, fast enough. He was smart, a veteran of the Canton's wars. He deserved to live in their world, even if the price was becoming a Hunter, even if it meant murdering others like him.\n\nGun still raised, Clyde scanned the parking lot, alert for any sign of surveillance. Hunters were equipped with the Canton's finest weaponry and supplies, resources he desperately needed, resources he could only acquire through robbery.  He slid into the driver's seat and slammed the door shut.\n\n\"Castillo!\"\n\nThe shout froze him.  Gun drawn, he swung around to face the voice.\n\n\"Don't shoot!\"  A young woman stood before him, hands raised, a semi-automatic rifle held loosely in her left hand.  Her clothes were tattered, a C-2 burned onto her leather corset.  She smirked. \"You're rising pretty quickly, you know that?\"\n\nC-2. Faye Baker. The second-best Hunter in the entire Canton.\n\n\"Aye, you know your criminals.\"  Faye stepped closer, her weapon lowered, unnervingly casual. \"Who's number one?\"\n\n\"*Maven*. Sammy Hicks.\" Clyde answered, his gun still trained on her.\n\n\"What are you at?\"\n\nClyde glanced at the registry chip embedded in his arm.  The neon display listed the Top 5 Criminals, his own rank flashing below: 36th.  \"Thirty-sixth.\"\n\n\"Nineteen days til the Cull. Think you can make it?\"\n\n\"I have to try.\"\n\n\"Aye, I guess we all do.” Faye lowered her rifle, holding it in both hands. “You show promise.  Smart hacker, knows what stores to hit, *doesn’t kill*.\"\n\n\"I've killed enough for the Canton.\"\n\n\"Haven't we all.\"  Her smile didn’t reach her eyes. \"I want the number one spot.\"\n\nUnease coiled in Clyde's gut. Was this a trap? \"And how does that help me?\"\n\n\"You're going to help me get there. In return,\" she grinned, producing a .500 Smith & Wesson, the Hunter's sidearm of choice, \"weapons. Supplies. Some semblance of safety. You'll stay as number two.\"\n\n\"Maven's getting old,\" Faye continued. \"It's time his reign ended.\"\n\nClyde knew he couldn't trust her, but who could he trust in this world? He needed the help. He needed to survive.  He smirked. \"Okay Faye, I'm in.\"\n\n\"Let the hunt begin then.\"  Faye's smirk mirrored his own."}

I planned to call him the moment I finished.  Thanks to my tutor's diligent preparation, I breezed through the exam. Stepping out into the bright sunlight, I fished my phone from my purse, eager to hear his voice.\n\nHe answered on the first ring, but something in his tone felt off.  He said he was happy there, that he’d actually been back for a day and had decided to stay permanently.  Devastation washed over me.  \"What about us?\" I asked, my voice barely a whisper.\n\n\"What about us?\" he echoed, his tone growing sharper. A familiar dread began to churn in my stomach. I started walking, a restless energy propelling me across campus.  Just walking…one foot in front of the other.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" he asked.\n\n\"Walking,\" I replied. \"It's all I can do right now.\"  I found myself in the bathroom of another building just as a class let out. I didn't want anyone to see my face, to witness the raw emotion I knew was etched there.\n\n\"Don't you love me?\" I finally asked. \"Because I love you.\"\n\n\"No."}

{"text": "Autonomous vehicles promise a significant revolution in the automotive industry, offering enhanced safety, increased convenience, and potentially greater fuel efficiency.\n\nOne of the most compelling arguments for autonomous vehicles is their potential to dramatically improve road safety.  While initial implementation will undoubtedly present challenges in sensor technology and accident prevention algorithms, continuous development and refinement should lead to highly sophisticated systems capable of minimizing, and ideally eliminating, accidents. As sensor technology advances, drawing on existing systems like anti-lock brakes and stability control, which utilize wheel speed sensors to mitigate skids and rollovers, autonomous vehicles will be able to react faster and more effectively than human drivers. The text highlights this progression, noting how sensor technology in the 1980s evolved to enable sophisticated vehicle control beyond human capability.  This continued advancement in sensors, computer hardware, and software suggests a future where autonomous vehicles achieve unparalleled safety.\n\nConvenience is another key advantage.  Human drivers must remain attentive and are often forced to drive while fatigued or seek alternative transportation if injured or otherwise incapacitated. Autonomous vehicles offer a solution, allowing passengers to travel safely regardless of their physical or mental state.  While some argue that drivers of autonomous vehicles must still remain vigilant, widespread adoption of the technology will ultimately lead to fully autonomous systems. In a future where all vehicles are computer-controlled, complex traffic scenarios, such as merging from a parking lot, will be seamlessly managed through inter-vehicle communication and coordination.\n\nFurthermore, autonomous vehicles have the potential for improved fuel efficiency.  Human driving habits, such as rapid acceleration, often waste fuel.  Computer-controlled vehicles can optimize acceleration and coasting for maximum fuel economy. The text supports this, citing the potential for autonomous vehicles to consume half the fuel of current taxis.  This translates into significant cost savings for owners.\n\nIn conclusion, autonomous vehicles represent a transformative technology poised to reshape the automotive landscape. Their potential to enhance safety, maximize convenience, and improve fuel efficiency makes them a compelling innovation for the future of transportation."}

{"text": "Technology pervades modern life, from complex diagnostic machines to simple computers and cameras.  These tools enhance our daily activities, and one particularly promising innovation is emotion-detecting software.  This technology holds significant potential for classroom settings, benefiting students, teachers, and even parents.\n\nOne key advantage of emotion recognition software is its ability to provide real-time feedback on student engagement and comprehension.  As Nick D'Alto highlights in \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" Dr. Huang suggests that \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\" This allows teachers to adjust their lessons dynamically, ensuring that the material is both understandable and engaging. By recognizing confusion or boredom, teachers can provide additional support or adapt their teaching style to better suit the students' needs. This responsiveness benefits both teachers, who can tailor their instruction, and students, who receive more effective and personalized learning experiences.\n\nBeyond immediate lesson adjustments, emotion recognition technology can also reveal broader emotional trends.  Consistent monitoring can alert teachers to significant shifts in a student's emotional state.  A typically happy student who suddenly exhibits prolonged sadness could be experiencing difficulties at home or school, prompting a teacher to check in and offer support.  This early intervention can be crucial in addressing issues like bullying or other problems that might otherwise go unnoticed.  Furthermore, parents can gain valuable insights into their child's emotional well-being at school, allowing them to assess whether the learning environment is a good fit.\n\nBy analyzing emotional data, educators can gain a deeper understanding of student personalities and learning styles. This information can inform lesson planning, curriculum development, and even classroom management strategies. The ability to identify and address emotional needs proactively contributes to a more supportive and positive learning environment.\n\nWhile privacy concerns regarding the use of emotion-scanning technology are understandable, the potential benefits for student well-being and academic success are substantial.  This technology offers a powerful tool for creating a safer and more effective learning experience, ultimately benefiting everyone involved. Therefore, integrating emotion-detecting apps into classrooms holds immense value for enhancing the educational experience."}

{"text": "KINGSLEY, MI – The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) is offering a $5,000 reward, double its standard offering, for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the shooting and neglect of a two-year-old pit bull in Northern Michigan.\n\nThe dog, named Phoenix by rescuers, was discovered by a hunter near Kingsley in Grand Traverse County on November 25.  He was suffering from a gunshot wound to the back of the neck, multiple wounds covering his face and body, and severe malnourishment.  After five days of intensive care by Grand Traverse County Animal Control and Cherryland Humane Society, Phoenix died on November 30. He had stabilized but began having seizures, likely resulting from brain injuries related to the gunshot wound, which ultimately led to his death.\n\n“Phoenix did not deserve to suffer – likely afraid and in pain – from a gunshot wound and malnourishment,” said Molly Tamulevich, Michigan state director for HSUS. “It takes a truly callous person to leave an injured dog to die.

Ce modèle était le dernier de la gamme Nexus, lancée en 2010 et conçue en collaboration avec différents constructeurs externes, avant d'être remplacée par la gamme Pixel, entièrement développée par Google.  Dès juin 2017, M. Tenzer affirme que son appareil a commencé à présenter des problèmes de déchargement prématuré de la batterie.  Contactant le service client de Huawei, il apprend qu'une batterie de remplacement lui coûterait 230 $.\n\nFace à ce problème, et alléguant un vice de fabrication affectant la durée de vie de la batterie, M. Tenzer a déposé une demande d'action collective le 21 mars 2018.  Il souhaite représenter tous les propriétaires québécois de Nexus 6P ayant rencontré des problèmes similaires. Plus précisément, la poursuite allègue qu'après quelques mois d'utilisation, les téléphones s'éteignent malgré un niveau de batterie affiché entre 30 % et 40 %.  Le téléphone ne redémarre que branché à un chargeur, affichant alors le même pourcentage de batterie qu'avant l'extinction, puis se décharge rapidement une fois débranché.\n\nL'action collective réclame une réduction du prix de vente, le remboursement des frais de réparation ou de remplacement de la batterie, et 100 $ de dommages punitifs par personne affectée.  Initialement, le juge Gary Morrison de la Cour supérieure avait rejeté la demande d'action collective en mai 2019.  Cependant, la Cour d'appel du Québec a infirmé cette décision lundi dernier, autorisant ainsi la poursuite à aller de l'avant.  La Cour d'appel a jugé que M. Tenzer avait démontré une cause défendable et sa capacité à représenter adéquatement le groupe.\n\nLe juge qui présidera le procès devra déterminer si la batterie présente un « déficit d'usage sérieux » et si elle viole la garantie de qualité prévue au Code civil du Québec.  Aucune allégation n'a encore été prouvée.  Notons qu'une action collective similaire a été intentée aux États-Unis l'an dernier, aboutissant à un règlement à l'amiable. Les plaignants américains ont reçu entre 10 $ et 400 $ américains en dommages punitifs."}

{"text": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a dynamic environment where physical objects communicate and interact, exchanging and processing information [1].  It bridges the physical and digital worlds [2].  IoT applications, such as Industrial IoT, smart healthcare, and smart cities, minimize user involvement through automated tasks.  Consequently, IoT interactions primarily occur between devices like sensors and actuators [3].\n\nAuthentication is crucial for securing electronic systems. Without reliable authentication, security services like access control and intrusion detection are compromised.  While numerous authentication solutions exist for IoT environments, they predominantly offer single-level protection.  Existing multi-level authentication solutions typically focus on user authentication [28].  To address this limitation, we previously proposed the M2I (Multi-Factor, Multi-Level, and Interaction-based Authentication) framework for IoT environments [29]. This paper extends the M2I framework to address multi-device-to-device authentication scenarios.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section II reviews related work. Section III outlines the high-level design and evaluation principles of the Many-to-One (M2O) hybrid protocols. Section IV introduces the design preliminaries and building blocks. Section V details the protocols themselves.  Sections VI and VII analyze and evaluate the protocols through experimentation, respectively. Section VIII compares the communication and computational costs of the proposed protocols with Kerberos version 5 to assess their efficiency.  Section IX provides further discussion, and Section X concludes the paper."}

However, I'm grateful for these unwitting masses who fuel my addiction. It wasn't the money, that useless relic of a bygone era, that intrigued me; it was the aftermath. The moment the final number confirmed what I already knew—that's when the desire would take hold.\n\nDesire, that untamable force, always beckoning, always ensnaring me with its deceptive allure.  It was desire that drew me back into the past, the desire to continually devise new ways to slip through time and continue the game of cat and mouse I so relish.\n\n\"Today's the day they finally catch me,\" I murmured, patiently waiting for the numbers to ignite my addiction. \"The day I'm finally outsmarted.\"  A habitual mantra before every game.

Thank you for that false hope.\n\n\"And tonight's lucky numbers are… 14, 29, 2, 11, 19, 31, and 17!\" the television announced.  Without glancing at my ticket, I knew I'd won.

{"text": "Harold sat alone at the counter of the small-town diner, staring into his coffee cup, a daily ritual.  He hated getting old. His body ached, his movements were slow, and the world seemed to be passing him by.  At an age when others boasted about fifty being the new thirty, Harold felt every one of his years. His back was shot, his knees ached, and the pain was a constant companion, managed only by pills and alcohol.  He’d lived hard, abusing his body, his relationships – two ex-wives, estranged children – even his so-called friends were just the same high school buddies stuck in this dying town.  He figured he was on borrowed time, just like his father and grandfathers before him.\n\nDonna, the waitress, poured his coffee, long ago giving up on small talk. Harold rarely responded, often not even bothering to wear his hearing aids. He’d always felt people talked just to hear themselves anyway, so the fading of his hearing was almost a blessing. The worsening vision, however, was a different story, a constant source of frustration.  He gulped the scalding coffee, finding a perverse comfort in the burn, a tangible sensation in a world of fading senses.\n\nHe gestured for a refill.  Donna poured, but her attention was suddenly diverted.  Hot coffee sloshed over Harold's lap. He lurched up, his back seizing in agony. \"Goddamit, Donna, what the f-\"\n\nHe turned to follow her gaze just as the tanker truck smashed through the diner's front window.  Chaos erupted. A flying napkin holder struck his forehead, and he crumpled to the floor by Donna’s feet. He dimly registered the sickening angle of her neck before the frigid, burning liquid from the tanker washed over him. His last conscious thought was of Bo, the dog he’d had as a boy, hit by a car.  Donna's neck and Bo’s… they looked so similar. Then, blackness.\n\nTime became a blur.  Voices drifted in and out.  He thought he heard his daughter, which was strange – she hated him. The words “coma,” “crash,” and “unlikely recovery” floated by, meaningless yet strangely comforting. He was focused on the sounds, realizing he could hear them with a clarity he hadn’t experienced in years, even without his hearing aids.  He felt thirsty.  He remembered how to talk.\n\nAfter an indeterminate amount of time, he croaked, \"Wa…… ter?\"\n\nSudden commotion. Lights. Anxious voices. His bed shook.  He opened his eyes to a flurry of masked doctors.\n\n“Mr. Burke? Can you hear me? Blink if you can understand.”\n\nHe blinked, surprised he’d obeyed. They spoke of the accident, the exposure to something… bad.  They urged him to relax.\n\nConfusion turned to annoyance. He sat up, ignoring the hands trying to restrain him. \"Let go of me, dammit!\"\n\nHe swung his legs to the floor, astonished. His hip didn't hurt. He stood, shifting his weight, taller than he’d been in years.  He reached for his glasses, his finger poking his nose instead.  He saw everything with crystal clarity. He swatted at the doctors, horrified as they flew across the room.\n\n\"My god, what have you people done to me?\" He strode to the locked door, pressing it. It flew open as if struck by a battering ram. In his hospital gown, he walked to a first-floor window, climbed out, and strode away.\n\nThe world was a symphony of sensations: the grass growing beneath his feet, the whisper of blood in pigeons' veins.  He was overwhelmed, barely noticing the guards encircling him. A woman in a business suit pushed through.\n\n\"Mr. Burke, I'm Carole. Please come back to the hospital. You're very sick.\"\n\n\"I'm not sick,\" Harold said, looking at her. \"I haven't felt this good in my life. I can see, I can hear… and you saw that door! I don't know what happened, but I'm not wasting it on you.\"\n\nA tingling sensation spread through him. He looked at his hands, smooth and firm. He was floating above the ground. He drifted towards Carole.\n\n\"You don't understand. I've been given a chance... to do something... big.\"\n\nThe tingling surged into blinding energy."}
{"text": "The widespread popularity of cars in modern society is undeniable. They are a primary mode of transportation, and for many, driving offers a sense of enjoyment. However, this popularity comes at a cost: a consistent occurrence of accidents. Whether due to driver error or collisions, the frequency of accidents raises serious concerns about the prospect of driverless cars.  With so many accidents already occurring with human drivers, entrusting control to a computer system seems premature and potentially dangerous.  It's reasonable to anticipate a rise in accident rates, not an increase in safety.\n\nOne of the major hurdles for driverless cars lies not just in developing the technology for the vehicles themselves, but also in adapting our infrastructure.  As some futurists have pointed out, the key to autonomous vehicles may lie less in smarter cars and more in smarter roads.  This would involve significant infrastructural changes, such as embedding electrical cables for signaling, magnets for alternating polarity, and binary code systems in roadways. While such technology is not beyond our capabilities, the associated costs are substantial.  Without addressing these financial implications, the development of \"smarter roads,\" and consequently, driverless cars, remains improbable.\n\nWhile driverless cars technically exist today, their reliability is far from guaranteed.  Current models may handle driving functions at low speeds (up to 25 mph), but often require driver oversight through touch sensors on the steering wheel. This places a significant burden of responsibility on the driver, demanding constant attention to the road and surroundings.  The lack of full autonomy necessitates driver vigilance, negating the purported safety benefits.  While manufacturers have incorporated warning signals to alert drivers to potential hazards, human fallibility remains a factor.  Missed signals can lead to accidents, ultimately placing the responsibility for safety back on the human occupant.\n\nThe introduction of driverless cars also presents complex legal and ethical questions regarding liability. In the event of an accident, determining fault becomes a significant challenge.  Is the manufacturer responsible for ensuring flawless operation of their technology?"}
{"text": "The question of life on Mars, particularly regarding the \"face\" of Cydonia, has sparked much speculation.  While some see it as evidence of alien civilization, I believe it's a natural formation.  It's difficult to imagine an alien species sculpting such a likeness without prior exposure to humans.  However, the intrigue surrounding this formation has undoubtedly fueled public interest in Mars, appearing in films, books, magazines, and radio shows.\n\nThis fascination drives scientific inquiry. My colleagues are committed to capturing higher-resolution images of Cydonia and other Martian features, hoping to identify potential signs of artificial construction.  However, Martian conditions, such as winter dust storms and cloud cover, present significant challenges to observation. The improvement in image resolution from 1976 to 2001 is substantial.  The 2001 images, with a resolution of 1.56 meters per pixel compared to the 1976 resolution of 43 meters per pixel, should reveal objects three times larger than the pixel size.  Theoretically, structures like buildings, vehicles, or even bodies of water should be visible.  Perhaps the \"face\" is an attempt at extraterrestrial communication, a message waiting to be deciphered with improved imaging technology.\n\nOn Earth, many natural formations resemble familiar objects. It's plausible that the Martian \"face\" is a similar phenomenon, albeit unusual on a supposedly lifeless planet.  Ultimately, it's up to scientists to determine the truth. While public opinion varies, only scientific investigation can provide definitive answers, whether today, tomorrow, or years from now. I'm optimistic that with current and future technologies, we'll eventually unravel this Martian mystery.\n\nThe existence of aliens remains unproven.  It seems unlikely they would have remained undetected, particularly if they possessed advanced technology like spacecraft.  The discovery of extraterrestrial life would undoubtedly cause widespread shock and fear, a scenario many anticipate and even prepare for.\n\nJust as we on Earth might investigate a peculiar rock formation on another planet, aliens might react similarly to Cydonia, prompting further exploration.  However, a human mission to Mars carries significant risks.  A hypothetical encounter with potentially hostile and superior alien life could be disastrous.  Robotic exploration, while having limitations in terms of adaptability and exploration of complex environments like caves, offers a safer initial approach.  Drones could survey the planet, paving the way for eventual human exploration, while mitigating the risks of a first contact scenario."}

Cuando son malos, tratas de superarlos, y cuando llegan los buenos, ves lo increíble que es”. Estas fluctuaciones, comunes en cualquier pareja, no empañan sus sentimientos por Kournikova: “Anna es la mejor.  Sabe que amo mi trabajo, me apoya siempre y está detrás de todo lo que hago”.\n\nEn sus últimas publicaciones en redes sociales, ambos expresan abiertamente la felicidad que les embarga.  El fútbol ha sido, durante el último mes, el pretexto perfecto para mostrar su alegría familiar.

Here’s how, starting with the biggest question mark of the summer:\n\n**Kevin Durant:**  The NBA has lived in the shadow of the Warriors for the past two and a half years, a dynasty sparked by Durant's arrival. This summer, his free agency decision will determine the league's future. If he stays, Golden State's reign of dominance may continue, potentially solidifying their place as one of the greatest teams ever. If he leaves, he could create a new contender (Knicks? Clippers? Lakers?), while simultaneously weakening the Warriors and leveling the playing field.  Durant initiated this era; now he controls its destiny.\n\n**Anthony Davis:**  While Durant's decision impacts the current era, Anthony Davis may well define the next.  A dominant force reminiscent of Hakeem Olajuwon in his prime, Davis consistently puts up incredible numbers for the Pelicans. Yet, even his heroics, alongside Jrue Holiday’s stellar performances, haven’t translated into true contention. If Davis declines a supermax extension in July, signaling his intent to enter 2020 free agency, the Pelicans will be forced to entertain trade offers.  Teams like the Lakers and Celtics, along with numerous others, will be clamoring for a perennial MVP candidate. The team that lands Davis gains an immediate inside track to the 2020 title.\n\n**LeBron James:** Fifteen years in, the league still revolves around LeBron, and 2019 will be no different."}

{"text": "Nearly a year ago, counties across Western North Carolina (WNC) received almost $10 million in state grant funding to improve rural broadband connectivity. This funding has become even more critical due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced a shift to at-home distance learning and encouraged businesses to allow employees to work remotely.\n\nIn May 2019, North Carolina launched the Growing Rural Economies with Access to Technology (GREAT) grant. According to Governor Roy Cooper and the NC Department of Information Technology, these matching grants targeted \"Internet service providers and electric membership cooperatives that compete for funding to lower financial barriers that prevent high-speed internet service expansion in Tier 1 – economically distressed counties.\"  The program, initiated by the N.C. General Assembly in 2018, subsidizes internet providers and electric cooperatives partnering with unserved and underserved rural communities statewide.\n\n“Access to reliable, high-speed internet service is critical for businesses to grow, students to learn, and communities to thrive,” Governor Cooper stated when announcing the funding. “These grants will help connect thousands of homes and businesses with opportunities across the state and around the world.”\n\nThe grants aided 14 companies, including Morris Broadband, which serves Macon County. These funds will improve broadband access for approximately 10,000 households and nearly 600 businesses and community institutions.\n\nIn Macon County, the Morris Broadband expansion aims to provide internet access to 226 homes in various outlying areas, including Gibson Cove Road, Granny Kate Lane, Stoudemire Drive, Schurman Cove Road, Annes Lane, Gibson Cove Estates Road, Willow Wind Heights, Willowbrook Estates, Bryson City Road, Iotla Church Road, Quail Hollow Road, Riverbend Road, Liner Drive, Iotla Hill Drive, Olsen Drive, Bennett Road, Sanderstown Road, Rain Ridge Road, Red Fox Lane, Buster Cabe Road, Tranquil Road, Holbrooks Road, Piney Grove Road, Lee Bates Road, Kangas Drive, Country Walk, Circle Trace, Dillon Drive, Main Trace, Center Trace, East Trace, Southern Trace, Dowdle Mountain Road, Wells Grove Road, Jennings Drive, Angel Cove Road, Chapel Cove Circle, Brookshire Lane, Oakridge Drive, and Hunters Trail. This project is estimated at $667,000, comprising $433,550 in state grant money and a $233,450 investment from Morris.  Currently, Morris Broadband provides internet services to just under 3,500 residences in Macon County.\n\n“The construction process began in the last quarter of 2019,” explained Morris Broadband General Manager Tony Carter. “This involved engineering design, pole permits and replacements, and other make-ready preparations.  These have all been filed, and we are just awaiting a few more responses and replacements before we can begin construction.”\n\nCarter stated that the company is now shifting its focus to the physical construction of the expansion project, anticipating a start date sometime in April."}

{"text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly altered our lives. One of the most critical changes is the normalization of social distancing.  Without a vaccine, distancing remains one of the most effective ways to protect ourselves and our loved ones. This is especially important while traveling.\n\nYou may have avoided travel entirely over the past few weeks. However, as governments work towards resuming normal life, caution is crucial for any necessary trips. Choosing the safest transportation option is paramount, minimizing contact with others while adhering to all other necessary precautions.  Hiring a car from a Guwahati car rental service offers an ideal solution, providing private and secure travel.\n\nHere are a few travel tips to ensure your safety and the safety of your loved ones when traveling through Guwahati:\n\n**Prioritize Safety with Self-Driving**\n\nIf emergency trips are unavoidable during this time, prioritize safe travel. Guwahati car rental services offer a viable alternative to public transportation. Compare Guwahati car rental rates to find a suitable option.  Taking a cab poses risks, as you are unaware of the driver's previous contacts.  Even exchanging currency can facilitate transmission. Self-driving offers the most secure option, minimizing these risks.\n\n**Masks and Sanitizers are Essential**\n\nAlways wear a face mask and carry hand sanitizer before leaving your home.  The risk of encountering a virus carrier or touching a contaminated surface remains high.  Regularly using a mask and sanitizing your hands minimizes infection risk. Carry extra masks and sanitizer, especially while traveling. Ensure your car is well-stocked with these supplies as a backup.\n\n**Long-Distance Travel Protection**\n\nFor long-distance travel, particularly to visit elderly parents or family, consider alternatives to public transport like buses or trains. Companies like Zoomcar offer car rentals in Guwahati for outstation travel, providing personal mobility even during these challenging times.  These services allow you to reach Guwahati or other destinations safely, avoiding crowds.\n\n**Safe Daily Commute**\n\nAs lockdown restrictions ease and workplaces reopen, commuting safely becomes essential. Avoid public transport and cabs, which increase your vulnerability.  Utilizing Guwahati car rental services offers a practical solution."}
{"text": "Lost in the urban sprawl of Los Angeles, I stumbled upon a disturbing scene.  A hulking man, easily three hundred pounds and radiating menace, stood on a corner.  Intrigued, and perhaps foolishly, I decided to observe him.  My approach was a clandestine crawl beneath cars and a dash through honking traffic.  Thirty minutes later, I reached the other side, unseen.\n\nThe man was delivering a crude pick-up line – \"What up, bitch?\" – to a woman who looked both puzzled and eager to escape, yet she hesitantly approached.  He repeated his offensive greeting.  Suddenly, he lunged, his actions suggesting a gruesome attack on her face.  Horrified, I watched from just two feet away, documenting the unfolding nightmare. He then threw her into the back of a taxi.  Driven by morbid curiosity, I jumped onto the roof of the cab.\n\nThe taxi ride was short.  At a small house, the man hauled the woman inside.  Desperate to witness the conclusion of this bizarre encounter, I spotted an open window and, despite the potential danger, hurled myself through, landing with a painful thud in what appeared to be a bathroom.\n\nExiting the bathroom, I followed a dim light and a discarded piece of clothing to a room.  Inside, a brutal scene unfolded.  The man, armed with a cylindrical weapon drawn from his belt, was repeatedly striking the woman.  Her screams mingled with his grunts.  To my surprise, she fought back with ferocity.  After a protracted struggle, the woman prevailed, leaving the man defeated on the floor.  \"Really?! 300 lbs and only a couple of minutes?\" she exclaimed, her voice laced with a mixture of exhaustion and triumph.\n\nAs she walked towards the door, I realized my precarious position. I scrambled back to the bathroom and hid behind the shower curtain. But she followed. She sat down on the toilet, sounds of pain escaping her lips.  She repeated the phrase, \"Oh God.\" Then, as she stood, I slipped. Discovered.\n\nThe woman advanced.  Fearing the worst – especially after my regrettable McDonald's lunch – I braced myself.  To my astonishment, she ripped off my belt, pulled down my pants, and tore off my shirt.  Then, she pressed my face against hers.  She... copulated with me.  The interspecies act felt surreal and wrong.  After an eternity, she screamed, \"Thank you,\" and then… she bit off my head.\n\nThe moral of the story? Stay away from praying mantises that resemble humans."}
{"text": "Semi-supervised semantic segmentation, the focus of this paper, presents a unique challenge: the need for rich and robust supervision from unlabeled data.  Two prominent strategies in semi-supervised learning, consistency and contrastive learning, offer potential solutions, but each has limitations in this context.  Consistency learning, which minimizes feature distance between pixels in different augmented views of the same location, provides reliable but limited supervision, neglecting relationships between pixels at different locations.  Contrastive learning, conversely, leverages pairwise supervision by encouraging similar features for positive pixel pairs and dissimilar features for negative pairs. However, determining these binary positive-negative assignments is problematic. Treating each pixel as a distinct class, as in image classification, forces neighboring pixels—often describing the same object—to have dissimilar features.  Alternatively, using pseudo labels to guide these assignments is susceptible to noise, where small errors can completely reverse the intended feature similarity supervision.\n\nIn semi-supervised learning generally, effectively utilizing unlabeled data is paramount.  Consistency and contrastive learning represent two popular approaches.  For image classification, given augmented views of an image (Fig. 1), consistency learning enforces similar features across different views, while contrastive learning encourages dissimilarity between an image's features and all others except those of the same image.\n\nTo address these limitations and achieve rich, robust supervision, we propose multi-view correlation consistency (MVCC) learning.  MVCC introduces a correlation consistency loss that enforces similarity between self-correlation matrices of different augmented views (Fig. 1).  This approach offers several advantages. Compared to consistency learning, MVCC analyzes similarities between a significantly larger number of pixel pairs, capturing a richer representation of the data distribution.  Crucially, compared to contrastive learning, MVCC avoids hard positive-negative assignments. Instead of directly increasing or decreasing similarity based on these assignments, pixel-pixel similarity is supervised by the similarity of the same pixel pair in another view.  This provides a weaker but more robust form of supervision, circumventing the issues of treating each pixel as a separate class and mitigating the impact of noisy pseudo labels, leading to state-of-the-art results in multiple settings.\n\nBeyond the loss function, MVCC incorporates a view-coherent augmentation strategy, ensuring pixel-pixel correspondence between views.  For image-level augmentations like random cropping, scaling, and flipping, we utilize sampling grids of affine transformations, implementing invertible and differentiable operations efficiently.  For region-level augmentations like CutMix, we enforce view coherence to maintain correspondence across views."}

{"text": "The rain poured down, drenching two soldiers in their leather overcoats.  They paused, gasping for breath. The taller one pulled off his gas mask, lit a cigarette, and offered one to his partner, who grunted a refusal.  He inhaled deeply, exhaled slowly, and looked up at the grey, rain-streaked sky.  Flicking the cigarette to the ground, he crushed it with his boot.\n\n\"Think we'll be pulling out of here soon?\" he asked.  His partner, gas mask still on, grunted again. \"You don't talk much, do you?\"  Another grunt.  The tall soldier laughed, clapped the shorter man on the shoulder, and pointed at a boarded-up building across the street.\n\n\"Think we might find someone in there, mate?\" he asked, hoping for disagreement. He was weary of this endless search for survivors of the gas bombing, questioning how any could have possibly lived through it.\n\n\"Maybe,\" the short man rasped, his voice gravelly, like a heavy smoker’s. Perhaps that was why he’d refused the cigarette.  The tall man knew *he* was growing tired of the taste of the looted cigarettes.\n\n\"You sure? That building doesn't look like it would have protected anyone,\" the tall man argued.\n\n\"Maybe. Maybe not.\" The short man picked up his gun and started toward the building. He paused, turned back, and whispered fiercely, \"Let's go.\"  The tall man sighed, replaced his gas mask, and followed, gun drawn.  They moved through the building, ready to shoot anything that moved.\n\n*Our cause is righteous and just. We will not falter.*\n\n---\n\n\"I am telling you, man, there is nobody in this building!\"  The tall soldier's frustration grew.  He trusted his partner's instincts, but something felt wrong about this building. A premonition of danger, a sense of futility, urged him to rejoin their company. \"Come on, man, I didn't hear whatever you heard. Let's just get out of here!\"\n\nThe short man stopped at a door and turned.  He removed his gas mask, revealing a face scarred by war: a milky eye, a crooked nose, and a beard that couldn't hide the damage. \"In there,\" he growled, his voice transformed from a rasp to a menacing snarl.  The tall man felt a grim smile form beneath his mask; all doubt vanished.\n\n*Our cause is righteous and just. We will not falter.*\n\n---\n\nThe door exploded inward.  Huddled around a small fire, two girls cowered behind a young boy who stood bravely, though his small frame offered little protection.  Two figures filled the doorway, gas masks and red-lensed eyes concealing their faces, black overcoats swaying, massive guns held ready.  The boy knew he had to protect his sisters, despite his overwhelming fear.\n\nSilence hung heavy as the soldiers surveyed the room.  The taller one watched his partner, who shifted restlessly, eager for action. The taller one seemed to hesitate. The boy took a deep breath, his dead father's words echoing in his mind: *Show them no fear, my son. You must not let your sisters ever doubt you.*\n\n\"Please,\" he whispered.\n\n---\n\nThe taller soldier cocked his head, a gesture of curiosity, or perhaps a cruel amusement. He wasn't sure why he even acknowledged the boy.  This child, playing protector, was one of the survivors they were ordered to eliminate. Their cause was righteous and just.  They knew the consequences of faltering.\n\nHe aimed his weapon at the boy's small chest.  His partner advanced toward the girls, weapon raised, ready to unleash its devastating power. *He should know the danger of being that close,* the tall man thought, his attention divided between his partner and the boy.\n\n*Our cause is righteous and just. We will not falter.*\n\nA single, resounding boom echoed through the building.\n\n\n\nThis restructuring focuses on pacing, clarity, and building tension. It streamlines the action and dialogue, and emphasizes the internal conflict of the taller soldier. Your writing shows promise, and this edit aims to help realize that potential."}

A boring routine, easily exploited.  But luck, or perhaps something more, was on her side.  I had even observed her mundane purchases, scoffing at the pet bird, the condoms.  *A pet bird?

{"text": "Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art results in language modeling, significantly outperforming LSTMs. One explanation for their superior performance is attention's ability to leverage long-range dependencies, while Recurrent Neural Networks are constrained by encoding past information within a fixed-size hidden state. However, this explanation doesn't address why specific transformer architectural choices, particularly exponential dot-product attention (sometimes ambiguously called softmax attention), outperform alternatives.  Exponential dot-product attention has gained prominence in contrastive and metric learning, featuring in state-of-the-art semi-supervised contrastive learning models.  In language models, exponential dot-product probabilities model conditional probabilities in Word2Vec and certain memory networks.\n\nDespite the empirical success of transformers, theoretical frameworks for their effectiveness remain limited.  We propose a probabilistic explanation for attention and contrastive probabilities, grounded in exponential family distributions.  Framing attention within the exponential family allows us to leverage related theory from statistics, machine learning, and statistical mechanics, providing insightful interpretations of the transformer architecture.

{"text": "RDF2vec [7] is an approach for embedding knowledge graph entities into a continuous vector space.  It extracts sequences of entities (walks) from the graph and feeds them into a word2vec encoder [2]. These embeddings have proven valuable for downstream tasks requiring numerical representations of entities and relying on distance metrics that capture entity similarity and/or relatedness [4].\n\nVarious RDF2vec walk extraction strategies exist, including weighted random walks [1] and approaches like community hops and walklets [8].  Furthermore, recent work demonstrates that using an order-aware variant of word2vec, rather than the classic implementation, improves the resulting embeddings [6].\n\nRDF2vec blends the notions of similarity and relatedness. This is evident in Table 1, where the closest concepts to \"Mannheim\" in the vector space include its timeline, a person, the local ice hockey team, and nearby cities. While all semantically related to Mannheim (e.g., Peter Kurz is the Lord Mayor), they are not necessarily similar.  A person and a city, for instance, share few common characteristics. This paper introduces two new RDF2vec variants: p-RDF2vec, which emphasizes structural properties (attributes) and thus favors similarity; and e-RDF2vec, which emphasizes neighboring entities (context) and thus favors relatedness."}

Profitons de cette offre numérique de qualité pour explorer des expositions désormais terminées.\n\nCe site nous emmène, par exemple, au musée de Vernon, non loin de Giverny, où se trouvait le dernier atelier de Claude Monet.  En maniant avec précaution le curseur – un peu trop sensible – on découvre une série de peintres, dont la plupart sont méconnus.  La promenade n'en manque pas de charme, grâce à quelques œuvres comme l'atypique \"Coin d'atelier\" de Monet (1861), qui joue avec les motifs décoratifs de la pièce représentée.\n\nLe charmant musée de Rouen s'intéresse, quant à lui, à la création du jardin de Claude Monet, le maître de l'impressionnisme.  Durant les quarante-trois années passées à Giverny, Monet a composé un tableau vivant à grande échelle : son parc, source d'inspiration inépuisable.  Botaniste dans l'âme, il a été secondé par son beau-fils, Jean Pierre Hoschedé, qui a constitué un herbier témoignant de leurs recherches communes.  Aux côtés d'herbiers anciens répertoriant les plantes locales, on découvre un \"portrait\" de clématites blanches par Monet (1887) et, de la même année, celui de pivoines somptueuses éclatant sur un fond de feuilles vertes.\n\nJusqu'en octobre, le MuMa du Havre proposait \"Nuits électriques\", explorant l'influence de l'apparition de l'électricité sur la vision des artistes.

A short, sweat-drenched man in overalls rubbed his sunburnt neck.\n\n\"I'm tellin' you, Sully…it happened.\"\n\nA tall man with long, dark brown hair adjusted his sweater vest and rose from behind his podium. \"You keep saying that, Wilfred, but this is simply two toasters. This can't possibly be what you claim.\"\n\nThe short man's brow furrowed, a disturbing glint in his eyes – a look that hinted at both madness and unsettling intelligence. \"It's two toasters, I know. But it's also the solution to every problem we'll face for the next thousand years.\"\n\n\"I assure you, two kitchen appliances cannot defy the laws of thermodynamics.\"\n\nThe other experts exchanged pointed glances at Wilfred, held between two armed guards.  With a collective nod, they gestured to the guards, who shoved him forward.  \"Show us how it works,\" the sweater-vested scientist, Dr. Sullivan, demanded.\n\nWilfred approached the case cautiously, as if it housed a dangerous animal. He ran his fingers across the bulletproof glass, thick enough to withstand an elephant's weight. The scientists had insisted on the precaution, given Wilfred’s claims about the device's potential power.\n\nHis hand reached inside, past a small locked hatch, and pressed down on a lever on the lower toaster.  He quickly withdrew and backed away until the butt of a rifle slammed into his face, sending a spray of blood from his nose.\n\nThe guards hauled him to his feet, gripping his bloody shirt. \"No need to run. There's certainly nothing that could hurt you *here*.\"\n\nThe toasters began to glow, the air around them shimmering with heat.  The scientists remained unimpressed. \"So far, your 'great machine' is merely producing hot air. *Impressive*.\"\n\nWilfred, ignored and bloodied, wept. Tears of fear? Sadness? Pain? Madness? No one knew, no one cared. He smeared blood across his lips with a trembling hand, staring intently at the toasters.\n\nThe lever sprang up with a light *ting*.  \"You've gone mad, Wilfred. This double-toaster can't even make twice the toast, with one stacked on top of the oth–\"\n\nSuddenly, the toasters rumbled. Holes erupted in their shells, emitting beams of intense, searing light. The scientists recoiled in terror.  The room plunged into darkness, illuminated only by the toasters’ now-fierce flames.\n\n\"You idiots! How much energy did you feed the device?!\" Wilfred roared.\n\nHis question went unanswered as the beams melted through the reinforced glass, slashing across the room. Wood furniture ignited, flesh seared. Screams mingled with the crackling of fire and the stench of burning.\n\nThe toasters, now a single molten mass, consumed the case entirely.  Thick smoke filled the room, obscuring everything.  The screams faded, replaced by wheezing and the occasional pop of burning wood.\n\nHours later, Dr. Sullivan stirred, lifting his face from the scorched tile floor.  He pushed himself to his knees, his body coated in soot.  The room was devastated; no toasters, no colleagues, no guards…and no Wilfred.\n\nHe stumbled out into the pristine lobby, the central hub of the labs. \"Anybody? Anyone there?\"\n\nHe'd always acknowledged Wilfred's brilliance, even as the old man's inventions grew increasingly outlandish. These toasters had seemed the epitome of that descent—simple in appearance, but with unknown capabilities.\n\nHe searched frantically, calling out, but the labs were eerily deserted, stripped of both personnel and equipment. Panic set in.  Reaching for his phone, he found his pocket empty.  He ran, fearing he was trapped.\n\nHe burst through the doors at the top of the winding staircase, only to be met by a hellish landscape.  Winds howled as liquid fire and lightning rained down from two colossal, winged toasters."}

{"text": "A new study by sex toy provider EdenFantasys reveals that honesty about sexual history isn't always a given in relationships.  While most people (76 percent) are curious about their partner's past, nearly one in three Americans (29 percent) admit to lying about their own.  Men are more likely to deceive, with 37 percent admitting to lies compared to 25 percent of women.\n\nThis curiosity isn't always welcome.  While over half of respondents (53 percent) crave every intimate detail, a third admit feeling jealous about their partner’s past, and one in five (18 percent) prefer to remain ignorant.  Learning the truth even led to breakups for 19 percent of those surveyed.\n\nDespite the potential for discomfort, the topic is bound to arise. Only 16 percent of couples have never discussed their sexual histories, with 28 percent talking about it frequently. While the average couple broaches the subject around five months into the relationship, a curious 31 percent delve into the past within the first month.\n\nThe primary curiosity?  The number of previous partners (56 percent), followed by the number of people dated (40 percent) and specific sex acts (30 percent).  Men ideally envision their partner having nine previous partners, while women prefer closer to six.  Interestingly, men consider six too few, while women draw the line at three.  Men are also almost twice as likely to inflate their own number.\n\n\"Your partner’s past is a taboo and often divisive topic,” says Fred Petrenko of EdenFantasys. “Our study showed a range of reactions, from celebratory high-fives to upset and even jealousy.  This extends even to partners' experiences with robots, as revealed in a previous study. At EdenFantasys, we are dedicated to understanding the complexities of human sexuality.”\n\nThe survey found men report an average of 13 partners compared to women's nine.  Despite potential anxieties, most (84 percent) are open to discussing their past.  Ultimately, the majority agree that a partner’s history doesn't impact their current relationship, emphasizing the importance of good communication in bed (76 percent) for a satisfying experience.\n\nPetrenko concludes, “The key takeaway is that a partner’s sexual history is less important than the present.  Good communication, perhaps enhanced with a sex toy, contributes significantly to a happy, healthy, and lasting relationship.”\n\n\n**Top Curiosities About Partner’s Sexual History:**\n\n* How many people they’ve had sex with (56 percent)\n* How many people they’ve dated (40 percent)\n* Sex acts they’ve done (30 percent)\n* Funny/embarrassing sex stories (23 percent)\n* Participated in threesomes/orgies (22 percent)\n* Nothing (18 percent)\n\n**The Debate: Should You Know Your Partner’s History?**\n\n* Yes, I want to know everything (53 percent)\n* No, I don’t want to know anything (18 percent)\n* Don’t care (29 percent)"}

{"text": "Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for guaranteeing safety in nonlinear control systems deployed in real-world environments [1], [2].  While initially applied to systems where the input directly affected the CBF's time derivative, recent efforts have extended their use to higher-order systems where the input's influence appears through multiple derivatives [3]-[6].  However, these extensions require verifying feasibility using complex system dynamics and can lead to complicated alterations of the safe set.  An alternative approach [7] involves designing CBFs for a simplified top-level model and employing a tracking controller to address the full system dynamics.\n\nAs system complexity grows, utilizing a simplified top-level model for initial control design becomes increasingly desirable, with subsystems subsequently addressing the full dynamics. Backstepping, a well-established technique for robust stabilization of higher-order nonlinear systems [8], [9], aligns perfectly with this approach.  It recursively designs a controller using the full system dynamics based on a top-level design, effectively handling mixed-relative degree systems where inputs influence dynamics at different levels.  Existing work has explored backstepping with state constraints through non-overshooting control [10], recently connected to CBFs [11], [12]. These methods achieve safety using structured controllers that create linear dynamic relationships between cascaded states, preventing setpoint overshoot during stabilization.  Other studies have employed backstepping with Lyapunov-Barrier functions [13]-[15] to enforce state constraints. However, these approaches couple safety and stability, potentially imposing restrictive requirements on safety constraints.  To our knowledge, decoupling stability and safety within a backstepping framework using CBFs has not been explored.\n\nA key challenge in combining CBFs with backstepping lies in finding smooth controllers that guarantee safety, as backstepping necessitates differentiating controllers higher in the integrator chain."}
{"text": "When developing machine learning solutions for classification tasks, practitioners frequently grapple with selecting the optimal performance metric.  Consider, for example, cancer diagnosis, where a cost-sensitive predictive model categorizes patients [12].  While the chosen costs clearly influence model decisions, translating expert intuition into precise quantitative cost trade-offs—that is, the performance metric itself—remains a challenge [1, 13].  Hiranandani et al. [3, 4] addressed this challenge by formalizing the Metric Elicitation (ME) framework, which estimates a performance metric using user feedback on confusion matrices.  The underlying principle is that leveraging metrics reflecting a user's inherent trade-offs within a specific task, context, and population leads to models that better capture user preferences [3].  Since humans often struggle to provide accurate absolute quality feedback [10], Hiranandani et al. [3] proposed using pairwise comparisons, where a user (oracle) indicates a preference between two confusion matrices.  Figure 1 (reproduced from [3]) illustrates the ME framework.\n\nExisting ME literature proposes elicitation strategies for binary [3], multiclass [4], and multiclass-multigroup [6, 5] classification settings, all assuming an oracle providing relative preference feedback on confusion matrices. However, to the best of our knowledge, no implementations have tested the ME framework or the assumption that users can effectively compare confusion matrices. This paper bridges the gap between theory and practice by presenting the first practical implementation and evaluation of the ME framework.  Our contributions are:\n\n* We propose a visualization for pairwise comparison of confusion matrices, adapting the visualization of individual confusion matrices from Shen et al. [11].\n* We integrate this visualization into a web user interface (UI) that solicits relative preference feedback on confusion matrices.  The UI implements Algorithm 1 from Hiranandani et al."}

La investigación, centrada en la calidad versus la cantidad de sueño, se enfocó en personas de bajos recursos que residen en zonas urbanas de países en vías de desarrollo, donde el ambiente de vida, con múltiples interrupciones, dificulta un sueño reparador.\n\nPara el estudio, los autores monitorearon los patrones de sueño de 452 voluntarios de Chennai, India, durante un mes.  Utilizaron dispositivos de actigrafía, sensores de muñeca que registran los ciclos de sueño en entornos cotidianos.  Los resultados revelaron que, a pesar de permanecer en cama alrededor de ocho horas, los voluntarios dormían un promedio de 5,5 horas, con aproximadamente 31 despertares nocturnos.

{"text": "STOCKHOLM –  Struggling chip joint venture ST-Ericsson, owned by Ericsson and STMicroelectronics, faces an uncertain future.  The two parent companies have enlisted an external advisor to explore strategic options for the loss-making unit.  This follows media reports that JP Morgan has been engaged to review possibilities, including finding a new partner, selling assets, or even a complete sale.  French newspaper Les Echos suggested a scenario where ST-Ericsson could be sold piecemeal, with technologies like connectivity, power management, and software architecture attracting different buyers.  Remaining parts of the business might be reabsorbed by the parent companies. While no decision has been announced, one is expected by the end of the year.\n\nST-Ericsson continues to struggle financially.  In the second quarter, it reported an operating loss of $235 million, attributed to the collapsing demand for feature phones from clients like Nokia and Sony Ericsson, and the challenging transition to supplying chips for the smartphone market.  The company’s full-year 2011 loss totaled $841 million on sales of $1.65 billion, and it has accumulated losses of around $2 billion over its three years of operation.\n\nWhile Ericsson and STMicroelectronics have publicly stated their support for ST-Ericsson's ongoing cost-cutting initiatives aimed at lowering the break-even point, analysts are skeptical about the prospects of a sale.  \"The possibilities for Ericsson are limited except to hold on to its share and try and do the turnaround themselves,\" said Mirko Maier, analyst at LBBW. Finding a buyer for the entire business, or even substantial parts of it, appears challenging given its financial performance.\n\nAlthough a sale or break-up wasn't explicitly mentioned in the official statement from the parent companies, Ericsson's head of media relations confirmed that all options are under consideration."}

{"text": "Deep neural networks are powerful, but their size and computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices like dash cams or in real-time applications such as autonomous driving.  Network compression addresses this challenge by reducing memory and computational costs. Popular techniques include quantization, knowledge distillation, and network pruning. Unlike other compression methods, pruning directly removes network components, typically involving a pre-train, prune, and fine-tune cycle. Pruning methods primarily differ in their granularity and importance measures.\n\nUnstructured pruning removes individual parameters or connections, resulting in unstructured sparsity that necessitates specialized software and hardware for acceleration.  Conversely, structured pruning removes entire channels, filters, or neurons, creating structured sparsity readily exploitable by standard hardware. This leads to both reduced storage and faster inference. This paper focuses on structured channel pruning.\n\nExisting filter/channel pruning approaches often employ different importance measures. While effective, these measures are frequently ad-hoc, locally computed, and not directly tied to the final task's utility.  Furthermore, few studies address visual detection specifically.  This paper proposes a gradient-based saliency measure for visual detection to guide the pruning process. Channels with higher gradient-based detection saliency contribute more significantly to the visual detector's predictions.\n\nOur key contributions are:\n\n* We leverage the gradients of the detection utility with respect to channel features as our saliency measure for pruning deep visual detectors in autonomous driving scenarios, a departure from most existing methods.\n* By incorporating ground truth bounding box information and surrounding context, we reweight the detection task gradients, further enhancing pruning performance and demonstrating significant potential for handling small-scale objects."}

{"text": "The world used to be simple.  I remember leaving my parents' home, venturing out to build my own quiet dwelling by the water. Land was plentiful then. Finding a companion, raising children – life followed a familiar, comforting cycle.\n\nDisruptions were occasional, not constant. A flood might wash away homes, fire might force a move, a neighbor might disappear without a trace. Sometimes the communal alarm would sound, warning of an approaching danger, a bolt from the blue in an otherwise tranquil sky. But mostly, life was easy, touched by fortune.\n\nThen came the fear, the uncertainty.  They came.\n\nI remember vividly the first time terror gripped me.  Gathering food for my family, I stumbled upon the body of a neighbor.  We’d recently quarreled, a fierce argument fueled by his unwanted advances toward my wife. I would have killed him myself had he touched her, but this… this was something else. His skin was flayed from his body. I stood there, struggling to comprehend the horrific sight, when my daughter’s scream ripped through the air.  She was caught in a trap, pleading for help.  And then I saw them. Two giants, their movements alien and unsettling, casually approaching my terrified child.  One pointed at me, uttering something in a language I didn’t understand. The other raised a strange object. A crack, sharp as the communal alarm, followed by an eruption of pain in my leg.  I glanced at the wound, unbelieving.  I ran. I abandoned my daughter. I ran until I reached the safety of my home, where my remaining family tended my wounds.\n\nWeeks have passed since that day.  Their presence has spread.  No longer confined to the water's edge, their massive structures now dominate the landscape, stretching as far as the eye can see.

{"text": "The increasing prevalence of fraudulent operations, intrusions, and attacks on computer networks has become a significant concern.  With over 90% of real-world activities now accessible online, including financial transactions, online shopping, examinations, and information exchange, the need for robust cybersecurity measures is paramount. While traditional technologies like firewalls offer a first line of defense, they are often insufficient.  Consequently, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are commonly deployed to enhance network security for businesses and organizations [1]. Firewalls provide passive, manual protection, while IDSs offer active, automated protection.\n\nAn IDS detects, tracks, and reports intrusive activities and security breaches within an IT infrastructure or network.  It analyzes potential events, including unpredictable behavior and imminent threats to network security designs, established policies, and outdated safety provisions.  The two primary types of IDSs are signature-based and anomaly-based. Signature-based IDSs utilize a database of known malicious activity signatures, triggering alerts when network communication matches a specific signature. Anomaly-based IDSs establish a baseline of normal system operations and raise alarms for deviations from this baseline.  While IDSs effectively identify various network attacks, a significant challenge is the high volume of false positives, which reduces their overall effectiveness [3]. A false positive occurs when an IDS incorrectly flags benign activity as malicious.\n\nIn recent years, the false positive rate has become a key metric for evaluating IDS effectiveness, playing a crucial role in the overall performance of these systems. IDSs, encompassing signature-based, anomaly-based, and hybrid approaches (Figure 1), are the most common method for detecting intrusions.\n\n\nSignature-based intrusion detection systems (SIDS) employ pattern-matching algorithms to detect intrusions, storing signatures of malicious activities in a knowledge base. Anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (AIDS) analyze normal behavior patterns and flag deviations as suspicious.  AIDS do not require a signature database and can potentially identify previously unknown, zero-day attacks. Hybrid systems combine SIDS and AIDS to leverage the strengths of both approaches, improving the detection of known malicious activities while reducing false positives for zero-day attacks [2].\n\nAlthough SIDS generally produce fewer false positives than AIDS, they are not entirely avoidable. This has driven research into strategies for minimizing false positives, including machine learning algorithms, visual content analysis, and intelligent false alarm filtering.\n\nNumerous intrusion detection strategies exist, but their accuracy, which depends on detection rates and false positive rates, remains a concern.  Reducing false positives and improving detection rates are crucial for enhancing accuracy.  This challenge has motivated the research presented in this paper."}

{"text": "Modeling long-range sequences is fundamental to solving many real-world challenges. Applications range from processing biosignals like electroencephalograms spanning tens of thousands of time steps [Tang et al., 2023] to comprehending and generating large documents (e.g., novels, scientific papers) using large language models [Zhou et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023].\n\nDeep learning methods are state-of-the-art for numerous challenging tasks, including learning functions over variable-length input sequences. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) emerged early as strong contenders. They compress sequences by incorporating input elements sequentially, using only O(1) operations per input token and sharing parameters across time steps (Figure 1a). Notably, RNNs are partially inspired by cognitive and neurological computational principles [Lipton et al., 2015].  Perhaps unsurprisingly, they also underpin another class of biologically grounded architectures: spiking neural networks (SNNs) (Figure 1b). SNNs process sequences using simplified mathematical models of biological neurons that relay computations using sparse binary spikes [Maass, 1997]. The goal is to emulate the brain's efficient neural coding, enabling computation with a fraction of the energy required by modern von Neumann machines [Hasler, 2017].\n\nRNNs are affected by vanishing and exploding gradients [Pascanu et al., 2013], stemming from unstable recurrent weight initialization and backpropagation through time (BPTT) (Figure 1a). These phenomena hinder learning long-range dependencies, and while gating mechanisms like long short-term memory (LSTM) [Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997] can mitigate them, they are difficult to eliminate entirely.  Furthermore, traditional RNNs apply nonlinearities at each time step (σ in Figure 1a), requiring iterative computations. This is acceptable during inference, where input sequence elements arrive sequentially. However, RNN forward passes become prohibitively slow during training with long sequences because they cannot leverage GPU parallelization due to the nonlinear state propagation [Yarga and Wood, 2023; Orvieto et al., 2023; Kalchbrenner et al., 2016].\n\nAdditional challenges arise in SNN learning because binary spiking is non-differentiable, precluding direct training with backpropagation. One solution is training an artificial neural network (ANN) and converting its continuous activations to spikes [Diehl et al., 2015]. However, this introduces inference latency and often leads to excessive firing, impacting energy efficiency [Davidson and Furber, 2021]. Another solution is training SNNs directly using surrogate gradients [Neftci et al., 2019]. Nevertheless, even with surrogate-based training, SNNs are generally outperformed by ANNs like LSTMs [Malcom and Casco-Rodriguez, 2023].\n\nThe Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] overcomes these RNN limitations by directly compressing the context for each token, measuring its relationship to all other elements (Figure 1c).  Besides improving performance, its core component, self-attention, is easily parallelized through GPU-friendly matrix multiplication, accelerating training [Zeyer et al., 2019]. Consequently, Transformer blocks have been crucial to the current era of large pre-trained models [Min et al., 2023].\n\nHowever, the parallel, dense matrix multiplications that have established the Transformer as the de facto standard also accentuate structural differences between SNNs and ANNs. SNNs are designed for neuromorphic platforms like Intel Loihi [Davies et al., 2021], potentially enabling orders of magnitude lower energy consumption. These efficiencies are partly achieved by representing information as sparse, address-identified events. Spike events then \"excite\" targeted synapses asynchronously, with accumulation occurring within postsynaptic neurons. This enables addition-based feature mixing, reducing costly Multiply-and-Accumulate (MAC) operations [Li et al., 2023].  Massive parallel matrix multiplications, as required by self-attention, contrast with this event-driven, brain-inspired computing philosophy. Therefore, lessons from Transformer research have seen limited adoption in SNNs [Zhou et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2023]."}
{"text": "Cybersickness: How to Manage the Side Effects of Screen Time\n\nDo you ever feel your computer screen’s light boring into your eyes, making your head throb?  Or experience dizziness or nausea after using your phone? These sensations, while easily mistaken for eye strain or fatigue, are often symptoms of cybersickness.\n\nWith the rise of remote work, online learning, and constant digital engagement, these issues might seem unavoidable.  However, as a human-computer interaction researcher specializing in cybersickness, I can assure you there are ways to anticipate and mitigate these effects.\n\nWhat exactly is cybersickness?  It encompasses a cluster of symptoms similar to motion sickness, but occurring without physical movement. These symptoms fall into three categories: nausea, oculomotor problems (like eye strain, fatigue, and headaches from overworking the eye movement nerve), and general disorientation (including dizziness and vertigo). Some symptoms, such as blurred vision and difficulty concentrating, overlap categories.  These issues can linger for hours and even disrupt sleep.\n\nCybersickness can be triggered by everyday devices like computers, phones, and TVs.  Recall the 2013 parallax effect on iPhone lock screens, which made the background image appear to shift with phone movement.  Many users found this extremely uncomfortable, as it triggered cybersickness. Similarly, parallax scrolling on websites, where background images remain static while foreground content moves during scrolling, can also elicit these symptoms.\n\nWhile the exact cause of cybersickness isn't fully understood, a leading theory, sensory conflict theory, suggests it arises from a mismatch between visual and balance information. Your eyes perceive motion, while your body registers stillness.  Everyday technology design can exacerbate this conflict.\n\n\nCybersickness in Virtual and Augmented Reality\n\nCybersickness is often more intense with virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). VR, which replaces the real world with an immersive artificial environment (think Oculus and PlayStation VR), can cause severe, escalating nausea, rendering some applications unusable. AR, which overlays simulated environments onto the real world (like Pokémon Go or head-mounted displays), tends to cause more severe eye strain.\n\nEven if you haven't used VR or AR, you likely will within the next decade.  The projected growth of these technologies for work, education, and entertainment—potentially exceeding $900 billion by 2027—suggests a corresponding rise in cybersickness.\n\nThe Potential Dangers of Cybersickness\n\nWhile seemingly benign, cybersickness symptoms can persist for up to 24 hours, potentially impacting daily functioning in dangerous ways.  Lingering headaches, eye strain, or dizziness can impair coordination and attention, posing risks, for example, while driving.  Liability for injuries related to device-induced cybersickness remains unclear.\n\nLong-term effects of chronic cybersickness are still largely unknown.  Similar to motion sickness, susceptibility varies widely; some individuals are significantly more prone.  Evidence suggests women, infrequent video game players, and those with poor balance may experience more severe symptoms.\n\nManaging Cybersickness\n\nIf prolonged computer or phone use triggers cybersickness, there are ways to alleviate discomfort.  Blue light glasses can reduce eye strain and sleep disruption.  Zooming in or increasing font size can also minimize eye strain.\n\nFor those interested in VR/AR but prone to motion sickness, warning indicators like Oculus Comfort Ratings can help manage expectations.  Calibrate devices for visual comfort, use them in open spaces to minimize fall risks, and take breaks at the first sign of discomfort.\n\nNavigating New Technology Safely\n\nThe rise of remote work, spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, has increased awareness of the challenges of prolonged screen time.  While the convenience is undeniable, the physical effects are real.\n\nHowever, don’t let cybersickness deter you.  Ongoing research promises to mitigate and prevent these symptoms across devices, allowing us to enjoy technological advancements without discomfort.\n\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

{"text": "Cars Driving Themselves? A Dangerous and Unnecessary Pursuit\n\nMany automobile companies, such as General Motors and Berkeley, are contemplating the creation of driverless cars.  These vehicles, envisioned to handle acceleration, steering, and braking without human intervention, are being touted as the future of transportation. Google co-founder Sergey Brin, for example, has developed a prototype with the aim of reducing reliance on taxis and buses.  However, the pursuit of driverless cars is fraught with problems and promises more disaster than progress.\n\nThe financial implications alone are staggering.  As highlighted in the \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" reading, these vehicles require a multitude of sensors, adding significant cost to the manufacturing process. While sensors themselves are not new, the sheer quantity needed for a driverless car makes the overall expense exorbitant.  Companies risk jeopardizing their budgets and potentially their entire business on this uncertain technology.  Pouring vast sums of money into such an unproven venture is fiscally irresponsible.\n\nBeyond the financial risks lie serious safety concerns.  Entrusting a computer with one's life is a dangerous proposition. As noted in paragraph 9 of the same reading, the potential dangers of driverless cars are so significant that testing them is illegal in most states. Accidents are inevitable, raising complex questions of liability.  Who is responsible in the event of a driverless car accident – the owner or the manufacturer?  The inherent risks associated with autonomous vehicles far outweigh any perceived benefits.  The safest approach remains a human driver in control of the vehicle.\n\nSome argue that driverless cars eliminate the need for personal vehicles and associated costs like insurance and gas. However, the projected cost of utilizing these autonomous taxis is likely to negate any such savings.  Ultimately, driverless cars represent an overpriced, driverless taxi service."}

{"text": "The Facial Action Coding System (FACS), a technology designed to detect the emotional state of individuals by analyzing facial features and muscle movements, presents both potential benefits and drawbacks. While proponents suggest its value in diverse settings, from classrooms to workplaces, a critical examination reveals a more nuanced perspective.\n\nOne of the most compelling arguments for FACS implementation lies in its potential to improve the educational environment.  By recognizing subtle emotional cues in students, educators could identify those struggling with hidden anxieties, sadness, or fear. This early detection could enable timely interventions, potentially reducing disruptive behaviors, bullying incidents, and academic underperformance.  Understanding a student's emotional state could provide invaluable insights, allowing teachers to tailor their approach and offer personalized support, ultimately fostering a more positive and productive learning atmosphere. As the article mentions, FACS could even help understand historical figures' emotions by analyzing their portraits. Imagine uncovering the emotions Da Vinci imbued in the Mona Lisa! This potential to analyze historical depictions of emotion offers exciting avenues for research and understanding.\n\nHowever, the introduction of FACS also raises significant concerns.  The claim that it could replace trained professionals in fields like psychology or social work overlooks the complexity of human emotion and the crucial role of human interaction in therapeutic settings. The time, money, and effort invested in these professions shouldn't be readily dismissed, and the potential displacement of human expertise by a technological system warrants careful consideration.  While FACS might offer a broad overview of emotional states in a group setting, it cannot replace the nuanced understanding and individualized support provided by human professionals. Relying solely on technology for emotional assessment risks oversimplification and could lead to misinterpretations with potentially harmful consequences.\n\nFurthermore, the very premise of relying on technology to interpret emotions raises ethical questions.  Do we want to live in a world where machines constantly scrutinize our faces and judge our emotional states? While proponents argue for the benefits of emotional transparency, the potential for misuse and the erosion of privacy cannot be ignored.  The notion that a computer can definitively understand our emotional state better than ourselves or trained professionals is a bold claim that requires further scrutiny.\n\nIn conclusion, while FACS offers intriguing possibilities, particularly in educational settings, its widespread implementation should be approached with caution. The potential benefits of early emotional detection and personalized support in schools must be weighed against the ethical implications, the potential for job displacement, and the risk of oversimplifying the complexities of human emotion.  While FACS may prove to be a valuable tool in specific contexts, it is crucial to avoid overreliance and to prioritize the irreplaceable value of human connection and expertise.  Further research and careful consideration are necessary to determine the appropriate role for FACS in our society."}

{"text": "Self-driving cars present a compelling idea, but I firmly believe they are not ready for widespread adoption.  Several critical safety concerns remain unaddressed.  One primary issue is the handover problem:  while these cars can handle many driving situations, they still require human intervention in others.  This creates a dangerous scenario where a driver, potentially disengaged after periods of automated driving, must suddenly react to a critical situation.  For example, if the car's sensors fail to detect a pedestrian crossing the street, the driver may not have enough time to react and prevent an accident. This raises a crucial legal and ethical question: who is responsible in such a case – the driver or the manufacturer?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this ambiguity surrounding liability creates a legal minefield. If an accident occurs, determining fault becomes complex. Is the driver responsible for not paying sufficient attention, even if they were relying on the car's automation?  Or is the manufacturer liable for flaws in the technology? This potential for legal battles between drivers and manufacturers further complicates the issue.  Additionally, the criminal implications are disturbing. Could a driver face charges for a fatality caused by the car's malfunction, even if they were technically following the rules of automated driving?\n\nFurthermore, the article I read about this technology did not mention any driver override system. This raises the alarming possibility that a driver, even if they see a hazard, might be unable to take control of the car in time to prevent an accident.  This lack of control in critical situations makes the prospect of self-driving cars even more risky.\n\nWhile some self-driving cars alert drivers to roadwork or other potential hazards through vibrating seats and flashing lights, the effectiveness of these alerts is questionable."}
{"text": "Driverless cars, a concept long envisioned by innovators like Sergey Brin, are a source of both excitement and debate. While acknowledging potential drawbacks, I believe driverless cars offer significant advantages and could revolutionize transportation, making it safer, more environmentally friendly, and ultimately, more convenient.  This potential stems from existing technological advancements, the promise of environmental benefits, and the potential for increased safety.\n\nThe foundation for driverless technology is already in place.  While the concept may seem futuristic, we are closer than many realize. Features like antilock brakes and sensors are commonplace, and companies like Google have been developing autonomous vehicles for years. As reported, Google has had cars capable of independent driving under specific conditions since 2009. These vehicles utilize a sophisticated array of technology, including position-estimating sensors, a roof-mounted rotating sensor, a video camera, radar sensors, GPS, and an inertial motion sensor. This rotating sensor constantly scans the car's surroundings, building a dynamic 3-D map.  Even this scanning technology isn't entirely new; automakers have been using speed sensors at the wheels for antilock brakes since the 1980s.  With these building blocks already available, accelerating the development of fully autonomous vehicles seems a logical next step.\n\nBeyond the existing technology, driverless cars offer compelling environmental and safety benefits.  These vehicles are projected to consume significantly less fuel than traditional taxis and offer greater flexibility than public transportation.  Reduced fuel consumption translates to a cleaner environment and a reduction in harmful emissions. Google co-founder Sergey Brin recognizes this transformative potential, believing that driverless cars could fundamentally reshape our world.\n\nMoreover, driverless cars promise to enhance safety significantly.  While no system is entirely without risk, autonomous vehicles have the potential to eliminate human error, a major factor in accidents.  Google's driverless cars, for example, have logged over half a million miles without a crash.  The multitude of sensors, including the 3-D scanning roof sensor, provides a comprehensive awareness of the surrounding environment.  Furthermore, features like vibrating driver seats and flashing windshield lights can alert drivers when intervention is required."}

The only goal was sleep before midnight.\n\nAnd she did.\n\n07:00 AM, Friday 25th of March, 2017. Haley awoke and marked another line on her calendar – thirty-seven in total.  The familiar sounds of a street argument drifted in through the window: the honking, the shouting.  It was a scene she could picture perfectly.\n\nThe city bustled, even at this early hour.  Haley navigated the crowded streets with practiced ease, sidestepping an errant elbow, hopping over a dirty puddle, and finding her usual spot in line at the coffee shop.  She noticed so much more now, small details, fleeting moments that most people missed.  How much life went by unobserved, unappreciated.\n\nThe aroma of coffee and fresh buns filled the air.  She ordered a single cup, the name written on it not her own.  The barista's weary smile and rote greeting couldn't mask the genuine affection behind it, the care that ensured the name on the cup was always spelled correctly.\n\nAcross the street, through an ornate gate, beneath blooming pink trees, Haley walked past uniformed workers exchanging tired pleasantries as they changed shifts. Some heading home to sleep, others just beginning their day.  Haley, too, had come from her bed, but her destination, her true home, was just ahead.\n\nInside the hospital room, pale, thin fingers dug into crisp white sheets.  A pained expression twisted Peter’s face, instantly smoothing into a smile as Haley entered.  \"Good morning, sunshine.\" He shifted on the bed, making space for her beside him, a silent invitation she never refused, even if it meant forgoing the uncomfortable chair.\n\n\"The barista sends her regards,\" Haley murmured, offering him the coffee and a bun, taking a bite of her own to mask the familiar pang of grief.  No matter how many times she visited, no matter how she braced herself, the sight of him wasting away stole her breath and pricked at her eyes.\n\n\"No coffee for you today?\" Peter asked, his blue eyes brightening as he inhaled the scent of the bun."}

Modeste walked out on Tianjin in 2018 after two seasons, citing unpaid salary. He subsequently signed a contract with Cologne, his former club where he enjoyed a prolific 2016/17 season, scoring 25 goals in 34 league games.  This new contract, signed late last year and running until 2023, was initially deemed invalid by FIFA's Dispute Resolution Chamber in January after Tianjin protested the move.\n\nHowever, Cologne’s managing director Alexander Wehrle announced on Thursday that FIFA has now granted Modeste permission to play for the German club. \"The Chinese FA, with the approval from his former club Tianjin Tianhai, has granted Tony the right to play,\" Wehrle confirmed.  He expressed his delight, adding, \"Tony is finally able to play football again. That’s the most important thing. Obviously we're happy about the fact that we won't just be able to see his qualities in training in the future, but that he is available to play for us.\"\n\nWhile Modeste can now play for Cologne, the club clarified in a statement that the legal dispute between the player and Tianjin remains unresolved and that Cologne \"is not part of\" this ongoing issue.\n\n[Remove the last paragraph about Firstpost and WhatsApp as it's extraneous information and not related to the news story.]"}
{"text": "Web application attacks are a primary target for attackers. Symantec Internet Security [9] reported that a staggering 1 in 10 URLs are malicious.  Web applications, typically using HTTP/HTTPS protocols supported by backend and frontend interfaces, are vulnerable to various exploits.  According to the Imperva Web Application Vulnerability Report [9], high-severity attacks predominantly involve injection techniques, exploiting HTTP/HTTPS web queries via GET, POST, and PUT methods.  Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and vulnerabilities in widely used JavaScript libraries account for 51%, 27%, 33%, and 36% of these attacks, respectively. This paper focuses on the most frequent web-based injection attacks: SQL injection, XSS, Remote File Inclusion (RFI), XML External Entity (XXE), CSRF, and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).\n\nNetwork Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) monitor network traffic within web applications.  Acting as an intermediary between the application and users, a Web IDS analyzes web traffic to detect anomalies or malicious activity [2].  Two primary detection approaches exist: anomaly-based and signature-based. Signature-based IDS functions similarly to antivirus software, relying on a database of known attack signatures.  However, it is ineffective against new attacks with unknown signatures. Anomaly-based detection identifies unusual behavior patterns deviating from established baselines. While anomaly-based detection excels at uncovering unknown attacks, it suffers from higher false positive rates.  Detected anomalies are often subsequently added to signature databases.  Furthermore, anomaly-based detection encompasses adaptive and constant detection methods [3]. Adaptive detection analyzes HTTP traffic on port 80, continuously processing incoming data, while constant detection analyzes stored traffic logs or current incoming traffic.\n\nConventional patching, effective for mitigating network-layer vulnerabilities, often fails against web application vulnerabilities like SQL injection, Remote Code Execution (RCE), or XSS.  This is largely due to insecure coding practices in modern web applications. Adhering to OWASP's secure coding guidelines can prevent many of these attacks.  Adaptive detection models effectively identify and classify anomalies, enabling developers to implement appropriate patches (e.g., Django's use of CSRF tokens).  Ideally, these models should learn and adapt to emerging attack vectors over time.  Anomaly-based detection approaches [2] typically employ adaptive models but struggle with high false positive rates.  This paper proposes a solution to manage false positives by employing an IDS that monitors system behavior patterns.\n\nSeveral challenges hinder the effectiveness of conventional IDSs and web application firewalls:\n\n* **Limited Datasets:**  Collecting substantial anomalous data requires sophisticated systems capable of capturing and automatically classifying attack requests, akin to an advanced attack-defense simulation.\n* **High False Positives:** Conventional systems using unsupervised learning algorithms like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [5] and Support Vector Machines (SVM) [7] require manual feature selection [6] and often produce high false positive rates.\n* **Labeled Datasets:** Conventional IDSs relying on rule-based strategies or supervised algorithms (e.g., SVMs, decision trees) require extensive labeled datasets for accurate classification [6].\n\nThis paper introduces SWAD, a deep learning-based web application attack detection model capable of autonomous real-time detection.  SWAD utilizes an autoencoder to analyze word sequences, assigning weights based on their significance.  The classification engine is trained on the ECML-KDD dataset to classify anomalous queries by attack type.  Implemented using a sequence-to-sequence model (encoder-decoder architecture), SWAD initially trains on 40,000 benign and anomalous web requests, followed by 20,000 anomalous requests and responses."}

Ce scrutin, le premier depuis la chute historique de Yahya Jammeh fin 2016 après 22 ans de règne, est considéré comme un test pour la transition démocratique du pays. Le président sortant Adama Barrow se représente face à son principal concurrent, Ousainou Darboe, figure de l’opposition à l’ancien régime.\n\nDe notre envoyée spéciale à Banjul,\n\nÀ la veille du scrutin, l'atmosphère est apaisée.  Pour la première fois avant une élection présidentielle, des citoyens comme Aliou Ba, commerçant, osent s'exprimer librement : « Le pays est en paix maintenant, nous sommes libres d’aller où on veut, de parler à qui on veut, de faire nos affaires, tout cela c’est nouveau. »  Ce climat de liberté est un changement majeur depuis l’ère Jammeh.\n\nArrivé au pouvoir à la surprise générale en 2017, suite à l’intervention des forces de la Cédéao, Adama Barrow sollicite un second mandat.  Certains, comme Mamadou Samba Ba, se disent satisfaits de son bilan : « Nous profitons de la démocratie depuis le départ de Yahya Jammeh. Le président sortant Adama Barrow est indépendant et très humble. Tout va bien maintenant, même si nous avons des problèmes avec la hausse des prix, l’électricité, l’eau. Je pense que le président travaille. »\n\nD’autres, comme Aïda Diane, qui avait pourtant soutenu Adama Barrow en 2016, expriment leur désenchantement : « Nous avons besoin de changement, nous avons besoin d’Ousainou Darboe comme président pour donner de l’emploi à nos jeunes, pour contrôler les prix, pour nos écoles et nos hôpitaux. On s’est battus pour Adama Barrow la dernière fois, mais il nous a trahi. »  Le non-respect de sa promesse initiale de ne rester que trois ans au pouvoir et l'abandon du projet de nouvelle constitution limitant les mandats présidentiels sont pointés du doigt. L'alliance controversée entre Adama Barrow et l’ancien parti de Yahya Jammeh, l’APRC,  ajoute à la désillusion, même si Yahya Jammeh lui-même soutient un autre candidat, Mammah Kandeh.\n\nMalgré son exil en Guinée équatoriale, l’ombre de Yahya Jammeh plane sur le scrutin.  Abdoulaye Saine, professeur en sciences politiques, s’inquiète de son influence persistante : « Je suis très gêné de voir Yahya Jammeh tenter d’influencer l’élection. C’est politique. Malgré tout, certains continuent à l’apprécier et ont apprécié la manière dont il a géré le pays. Il y a des gens, y compris au sein de l’administration, qui restent de fervents soutiens. Personnellement, je souhaite qu’il reste là où il est, jusqu’à ce qu’on puisse le juger pour toutes les atrocités commises. »\n\nLa publication du rapport de la Commission vérité et réconciliation la semaine dernière pose la question de la mise en œuvre de ses recommandations.

{"text": "While the world has been comprehensively mapped in 2D for decades, the vertical dimension remains underexplored despite its vast potential. This gap is particularly critical in the Global South due to inherent mapping inequalities and diverse data availability.  Accurately representing human settlements in 3D requires describing the vertical dimension in addition to 2D footprints and shapes [19, 11, 14, 7, 23]. Such 3D representations are crucial for various applications, including quiet and shadow routing [35], environmental exposure modeling [2, 40, 34], architecture and city planning [32, 36], and population capacity estimation [37, 21].  However, deriving low-cost, open-source 3D building representations at scale remains a challenge.  Here, \"low-cost\" primarily refers to the cost of data acquisition for 3D building modeling.\n\nTraditional methods like photogrammetry and remote sensing make 3D city reconstruction expensive and time-consuming, often requiring extensive expertise and substantial geospatial data (e.g., cadastral data, airborne photogrammetry data). This poses a significant barrier for stakeholders and city governments with limited funding seeking to establish 3D city modeling systems.  Fortunately, the growing availability of Volunteer Geographic Information (VGI) and crowdsourcing technology [16] offers a scalable, low-cost solution for 3D world mapping.  OpenStreetMap (OSM), the most successful VGI project, has emerged as a valuable global data source for creating large-scale 3D city models [14, 12].  For example, a method for generating large-scale 3D urban reconstructions by jointly processing OSM and multi-sensor remote sensing data (e.g., TanDEM-X and Sentinel-2) was developed in [10].  Milojevic-Dupont et al.

{"text": "(NOTICIAS YA).- Los residentes de Colorado están enfrentando un aumento considerable en sus facturas de gas, con incrementos de dos dígitos debido a que los proveedores transfieren el costo de la inflación del gas natural a sus clientes.  Este aumento, que se suma a otros cargos adicionales, amenaza con impactar fuertemente los bolsillos de los habitantes del estado, según advierten la Comisión de Servicios Públicos y los defensores de los consumidores.\n\nConcretamente, las tarifas de gas de Xcel aumentarán más del 14% en promedio para el consumidor durante el último trimestre del año.  En algunas áreas atendidas por Black Hills Energy, las facturas se dispararán hasta un 50%.  Atmos Energy y Colorado Natural Gas también han anunciado aumentos en los costos del gas, que oscilan entre el 11% y el 24% para el consumidor residencial promedio durante los meses de invierno.\n\nAdemás del gas, la electricidad también está subiendo.  Empresas como Xcel, que utilizan gas natural para generar electricidad,  incrementarán sus tarifas eléctricas en un 3% con respecto al trimestre anterior para compensar el aumento del precio de esta materia prima.  A modo de ejemplo, Xcel genera actualmente alrededor del 37% de su electricidad en Colorado con plantas de gas natural.\n\nAnte esta situación, la Comisión de Servicios Públicos de Colorado (PUC) ha tomado cartas en el asunto.

{"text": "Wi-Fi, ubiquitous in public and private spaces due to its simplicity, reliability, and flexibility, presents a unique opportunity for environmental sensing.  By analyzing signal features like phase differences and Doppler shifts, we can detect and track targets.  This has spurred research into Wi-Fi-based target sensing, particularly at lower frequencies, using methods like fingerprint-based and geometry-based approaches.  These methods, while effective due to rich multipath signals and low attenuation, rely heavily on channel state information (CSI), and their accuracy is limited by antenna numbers and bandwidth.  Moreover, these systems, primarily designed for communication, haven't prioritized sensing.  Recognizing this, the IEEE 802.11bf task group (TGbf) is adapting the Wi-Fi standard to incorporate sensing capabilities, including utilizing 802.11ad and 802.11ay protocols operating in the millimeter wave (mmWave) band, promising enhanced sensing performance.\n\nMmWave sensing, while attractive, faces challenges due to high path loss and susceptibility to blockage.  Phased-array antennas and beamforming techniques mitigate attenuation by enabling estimation of the angle of departure (AoD) and angle of arrival (AoA).  The large bandwidth of mmWave further provides high distance resolution, facilitating accurate geometric target sensing.\n\nPrior work demonstrates mmWave's potential for sub-decimeter accuracy in short-range sensing, such as gesture tracking, by leveraging two Wi-Fi links to detect CSI phase changes. However, these approaches often require specific transceiver placement and assume a line-of-sight (LoS) path.  POLAR, a passive target sensing algorithm for IEEE 802.11ad devices, uses AoD and time of flight (ToF) from the channel impulse response (CIR) to sense targets, but only in 2D space and assuming LoS conditions.  Non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions, with increased ToF and altered AoA, introduce significant sensing errors if treated as LoS measurements.  While monostatic radar offers direct range and radial speed estimation, multi-device mmWave sensing, with its multi-angle detection, holds greater potential for improved accuracy.\n\nThis paper explores a novel sensing method between two devices in 3D space, a significantly more challenging problem.  The absence of a LoS path makes baseline information unknown, rendering bistatic triangle calculations infeasible.  Furthermore, diverse target locations on different planes and the complex geometry between targets, transmitter, and receiver add to the complexity.  To address these challenges, we propose mm3NLoS, an enhanced mmWave sensing algorithm for 3D NLoS environments, which exploits the geometric relationship of multiple NLoS paths.  Our key contributions are:  (1) an enhanced sensing approach for 3D NLoS environments, mitigating performance degradation in weak or blocked LoS scenarios; (2) the introduction of projection to simplify the problem and derive an analytical expression for the direction and distance between target and receiver using AoD, AoA, and ToF of two propagation paths; and (3) a performance comparison with the POLAR algorithm using simulated data, demonstrating the superior performance of our method regardless of LoS path availability."}

Governments sponsored training facilities emphasizing multi-disciplinary competitions like triathlons, biathlons, and even newly invented hybrids like the MMArathon. It became clear that the world was cultivating peak-human athletes, handsomely rewarded, to compete in Galactic Deathball.\n\nYears passed uneventfully. The initial global unity eroded with time, and the fervor for the new sports waned, losing sponsorship in many countries.  However, dedicated communities of practitioners kept them alive.\n\nThen came the second message. A copy of “The Rulebook” materialized beside every sleeping person, staggered in delivery.  Written in two languages—one unsettlingly alien, the other the recipient's native tongue—it provided the ultimate Rosetta Stone.  The alien language was deciphered almost as quickly as it was uploaded online.\n\n“The Rulebook” proved a partial misnomer.  Much of the text detailed the game's history, past events, and background information—more scholarly treatise than technical manual.  Perhaps this was because the game itself was deceptively simple.\n\nThe playing field: an equilateral polygon, minimum four sides, ranging from a quarter-mile to just under a half-mile across.  The number of sides equaled twice the number of competing teams.\n\nTeams were assigned starting positions along the polygon's faces, the order determined by a draw. The Deathball—a one-quarter kilogram iron sphere with universally graspable handholds—was placed at the field's center.\n\nUpon the starting signal, players had five seconds to enter the field. Leaving without the Deathball meant death. Leaving with it granted the power to choose who died, followed by a field reset. The game ended when only one team remained.\n\nThe only restrictions: players had to be unmodified members of their species, and equipment was limited to worn items extending no more than four millimeters from the skin in any given pose.\n\nThe game clearly prioritized strength, speed, and above all, endurance. MMArathon’s popularity surged.\n\nTwo more years passed before The Ship arrived. Earth was ready. Strategies were honed, a non-lethal version of Deathball had spawned eight world championships, and the team—the Heroes of Earth—boarded the ship amidst a roar of global support.\n\nThe team comprised the planet's finest physical specimens: long-distance sprinters built for speed, brutal martial artists, all possessing the endurance to run marathons and fight multiple consecutive matches.\n\nAs the match began, every screen on Earth switched on, broadcasting the event.  The planet watched, waited, and worried.\n\nWorry proved unnecessary."}

{"text": "The design of distributed controllers presents a significant challenge due to the scarcity of dedicated numerical tools compared to the well-equipped centralized design context.  Existing computational methods, such as those in [1]-[4], employ specialized techniques to address the inherent numerical complexities of distributed control.\n\nOne notable approach, presented in [5], attempts to enforce sparsity constraints directly on a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) approximation of the Youla parameter.  However, this method relies on restrictive assumptions like Quadratic Invariance (QI) and strong stabilizability [6], and, crucially, cannot handle sparsity patterns in non-sparse affine expressions of the Youla parameter, as highlighted in Section 5 of that work.\n\nThe System-Level Synthesis (SLS) framework, introduced in [7], addressed some of these limitations.  However, its focus on discrete-time systems has led to other promising architectures being overlooked.  For example, Network Realization Function (NRF) representations, discussed in [8] and [9], offer an alternative approach but have been overshadowed by the FIR approximation methods prevalent within the SLS framework."}

{"text": "Driveless cars, while promising a technological breakthrough, present significant safety and logistical concerns that warrant careful consideration before widespread adoption.  The central issue lies in the untested nature of these vehicles in real-world scenarios.  While the idea of autonomous driving is appealing, relying entirely on technology for safety raises serious questions.\n\nOne primary concern is the unpredictable nature of other drivers. Human drivers can react instinctively to erratic maneuvers by other vehicles, such as swerving or sudden braking.  A driveless car, relying on algorithms, might not possess the same flexibility and adaptability. For example, a sudden swerve by another driver into your lane might cause a human to instinctively steer into the next lane. A computer, however, might react by abruptly stopping, potentially causing a chain reaction accident. This lack of human-like judgment in complex situations poses a significant safety risk.\n\nBeyond the interactions with other drivers, the car's own functionality presents challenges.  What happens if the car malfunctions?  Every machine is prone to glitches, and in a driveless car, a glitch could have disastrous consequences.  Can we guarantee that the computer will always make the correct decision in a split second?\n\nFurthermore, practical considerations like fuel and battery life add another layer of complexity. A self-driving car cannot simply pull over to a gas station when it's running low on fuel, nor can it easily be jump-started if the battery dies.  A distracted or sleeping passenger might not notice these issues until it's too late, leaving them stranded. While alerts could be implemented, there's no guarantee they will always be effective. This reliance on technology without a reliable backup system creates potential for hazardous situations.\n\nRoad conditions also pose a significant challenge. Potholes, debris, and other road hazards require drivers to make quick decisions and adjustments.  While humans can easily navigate around these obstacles, a driveless car's ability to perceive and react appropriately is still under development."}
{"text": "This story was originally published by Carolina Public Press.\n\nFor over three decades, the Alleghany Education Foundation has funded the college educations of thousands of students in Alleghany County. Established in 1985 by former Alleghany County Schools Superintendent John Woodruff, the foundation has awarded millions of dollars in scholarships, enabling students in this sparsely populated North Carolina mountain county to attend institutions ranging from community colleges to Yale.\n\nThis year, however, the foundation saw a decline in scholarship applications from Alleghany High School students—90 compared to 104 in 2020 and 111 in 2019.  While seemingly small, this reduction is significant for a school with approximately 400 students.\n\nThis decline mirrors a statewide and national trend following the COVID-19 pandemic.  A June report from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center revealed that overall spring higher education enrollment fell by 3.5% (603,000 students) to 16.9 million from 17.5 million. This drop is seven times greater than the previous year's decline.  Undergraduate enrollment accounted for the entire loss, decreasing by 4.9% (727,000 students).  While all postsecondary sectors experienced undergraduate enrollment declines, community colleges were hardest hit with a 9.5% drop (476,000 students), representing over 65% of the total undergraduate enrollment loss.  North Carolina community colleges experienced an 11% enrollment decline in fall 2020.\n\nWilkes Community College (WCC) in Wilkesboro, which partners with the Alleghany Education Foundation to offer last-dollar scholarships providing Alleghany County students with two years of tuition-free education, has experienced an even steeper enrollment decline.\n\n“Unfortunately, we saw a staggering 16% enrollment drop during COVID last year,” said WCC President Jeff Cox. “Despite our efforts with the WCC Education Promise program—launching this fall to provide a tuition-free guarantee to all eligible students in Wilkes, Ashe, and Alleghany counties—enrollment remains low this fall.”\n\nIn rural Alleghany County, the reasons for declining college enrollment are complex, but the combined impact of COVID-19 and poverty is undeniable. According to Alleghany High School Assistant Principal Melissa Vestal, the blend of synchronous and asynchronous instruction last year allowed some students to work and complete coursework outside traditional school hours.  “After entering the workforce, some students became reliant on their income and chose to continue working rather than pursue education, stating they would ‘go to school once they had some money saved,’” Vestal said. “Students who weren’t planning to attend college didn’t bother applying for scholarships.”\n\nThis decline in college enrollment, and consequently scholarship applications, comes as the Alleghany Education Foundation’s available funds have surpassed $7 million—a substantial amount for a county with only about 11,000 residents and a median household income of $37,830, according to 2019 U.S. census data.  The foundation relies solely on private donations, often testamentary gifts, some exceeding $1 million, and many connected to Woodruff or his wife, Rita, a longtime hospice nurse.\n\n“We feel like John’s still working in this county,” said Warren Taylor, the foundation’s current president.  “We received a million-dollar testamentary gift designated for the John Woodruff fund. These gifts come from people he knew, a testament to his relationships.”\n\nBefore the pandemic, the Alleghany Education Foundation and WCC formed a partnership to leverage these funds and expand educational opportunities. Cox, a former Alleghany County Schools superintendent and Alleghany Education Foundation board member, noticed the declining WCC enrollment from Alleghany County and believed the foundation could help.\n\n“Our Alleghany County enrollment had dwindled to single digits,” he said. “Few students were taking advantage of community college; many were going to universities, but often returned due to financial issues or the overwhelming environment of larger institutions.”\n\nThe resulting partnership created a last-dollar scholarship fund, guaranteeing two tuition-free years at WCC for eligible Alleghany County graduating seniors.  Students must meet criteria including financial need, GPA, and extracurricular involvement.  As a last-dollar scholarship, the fund covers any remaining tuition after federal aid like Pell Grants.\n\n“Alleghany County enrollment was as low as seven students in 2014, but now we have 20 to 30 students annually, about 25% of graduating seniors,” Cox said. “Before the pandemic, we saw a significant increase.”\n\nSimilar promise programs exist at other North Carolina community colleges. Several schools offer free tuition this fall through combined federal, state, local, and philanthropic funding.  Institutions like Forsyth Technical Community College and Southwestern Community College have seen application increases due to these programs.  North Carolina’s 2021 high school graduates from low- and middle-income families may also qualify for the new Longleaf Commitment grants, providing at least $2,800 for tuition and fees at any state community college.\n\nWCC expanded its free tuition program to two neighboring counties this fall. “Inspired by the Alleghany program, we’re extending the same concept to Wilkes and Ashe counties,” Cox explained.  “We’re currently fundraising $8.5 million to endow this comprehensive program.”\n\nWhile enrollment hasn’t yet risen to Cox’s expectations, he hopes the initiative will reach more students as the pandemic’s impact recedes.  For students in these rural counties, many of whom cannot afford college without such assistance, this funding represents a crucial opportunity to break the cycle of poverty.\n\n“For many students, starting with two years at WCC is a better solution,” Cox said. “Even for those aspiring to a four-year degree, it’s a good starting point. While a four-year degree isn’t for everyone, postsecondary credentials are essential for living-wage jobs.”\n\n\nCarolina Public Press is an independent, in-depth, and investigative nonprofit news service for North Carolina."}

{"text": "The once futuristic dream of driverless cars is rapidly becoming a reality.  Engineers and scientists are no longer confined to science fiction; they are actively developing self-driving technology.  Major car manufacturers are investing heavily in this innovation, bringing us closer to a world where we can summon a vehicle with a simple text or call. This technology promises not only convenience—eliminating the need for car maintenance and repairs—but also a potential transformation of transportation as we know it.\n\nBut what practical applications will these vehicles have?  One key benefit lies in providing transportation for those without driver's licenses. Teenagers and young adults could easily summon a driverless car for rides to and from school, extracurricular activities, or sporting events, relieving parents of the burden of chauffeuring.  This technology could also revolutionize the taxi industry, addressing safety concerns associated with traditional taxis.  Unlike human drivers, a driverless system eliminates the risk of price manipulation or unnecessarily long routes.  Passengers can expect efficient, fairly priced rides to their destinations.  Furthermore, the potential fuel efficiency of these vehicles could significantly reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.\n\nBeyond convenience and cost, driverless technology has the potential to drastically improve road safety.  While fully autonomous vehicles are still under development, existing driver-assistance systems are already demonstrating life-saving capabilities.  Subaru, for example, has pioneered safety features that allow vehicles to brake automatically in emergencies.  Sensors detect potential collisions and activate the brakes before a human driver can react.  Consider a scenario where a distracted driver backing out of a driveway fails to notice oncoming traffic.  The car's sensors detect the danger and automatically stop, preventing a potentially disastrous accident.  Such technology can mitigate human error and prevent countless accidents caused by inattention or delayed reaction times.\n\nIn conclusion, while driverless technology is still evolving, its potential is undeniable.  We are on the cusp of a transportation revolution, with safer, more efficient travel within reach.  Beyond individual benefits, the widespread adoption of driverless cars could transform our economy and reduce our reliance on traditional transportation systems. Even if fully autonomous vehicles remain a work in progress, the advances in driver-assistance systems are already making our roads significantly safer.  The future of transportation is not just driverless; it's safer, smarter, and more efficient."}

JxCat pide tiempo a Torrent para convencerlos.  PSC y CatECP rechazan investir a Sánchez.\n\nLa secretaria general de ERC y líder parlamentaria, Marta Rovira, comunicó formalmente este lunes al presidente del Parlament, Roger Torrent, el apoyo de su partido a la candidatura de Jordi Sánchez (JxCat) a la presidencia de la Generalitat. El objetivo es levantar la aplicación del artículo 155.  Sin embargo, la CUP asegura que se abstendrá si Sánchez, o cualquier otro candidato, no presenta un programa republicano. Tras el anuncio de Torrent, Puigdemont y Comín podrían verse obligados a renunciar a su escaño (no pueden delegar su voto) para que las cuentas independentistas cuadren y Sánchez pueda ser investido.\n\nEn rueda de prensa posterior a su reunión con Torrent, Rovira explicó que el apoyo a Sánchez busca la formación de un Govern que permita a Cataluña \"recuperar las instituciones y levantar el 155\".  Este apoyo, fruto de un preacuerdo con JxCat (cuyos detalles no reveló),  depende del respaldo de la CUP, que por el momento no se ha concretado.\n\nEl otro pilar independentista necesario para la mayoría parlamentaria, la CUP, advirtió a JxCat y ERC que sus cuatro diputados se abstendrán en la investidura de cualquier candidato que no presente un programa republicano catalán,  considerando autonomista la propuesta actual de Govern.\n\nCarlos Riera, tras reunirse con Torrent,  afirmó: \"Un candidato autonomista contará con nuestra abstención. Con un programa republicano sobre la mesa, aceptaremos cualquier nombre\". La premisa es clara: solo un programa de desarrollo de una república obtendrá su apoyo. De lo contrario, se abstendrán.  \"Si se precipita una investidura, contarán con nuestra abstención\",  reiteró,  insistiendo en el  desacuerdo  con ERC y JxCat sobre el programa de Govern expresado en el Consell Polític de la CUP.\n\nLa CUP busca poner a prueba la \"verdadera voluntad de soberanía republicana institucional\" de JxCat y ERC, considerando que sus cuatro abstenciones son decisivas para cualquier candidato.\n\nJxCat, a través de sus portavoces Elsa Artadi y Eduard Pujol, solicitó a Torrent tiempo para convencer a la CUP, pidiendo que el pleno no se convoque antes de 48 horas.  Artadi explicó que JxCat ultima un acuerdo con ERC que se presentará próximamente, y que confían en que satisfaga a la CUP al profundizar en la \"construcción de la república\" y el proceso constituyente.\n\nSin la CUP, los independentistas pierden la mayoría absoluta de 70 diputados, imposibilitando la investidura en primera vuelta. En segunda vuelta, basta una mayoría simple (más síes que noes).  JxCat y ERC suman 66 diputados frente a los 65 del resto de grupos, pero el voto de cuatro de ellos (Puigdemont, Comín, Junqueras y Sánchez) no está garantizado.\n\nJunqueras (ERC) y Sánchez (JxCat) previsiblemente podrán delegar su voto desde prisión. Sin embargo, Puigdemont (JxCat) y Comín (ERC) lo tienen difícil, ya que los letrados del Parlament y el Tribunal Supremo advierten que delegar el voto desde Bélgica contraviene el reglamento."}

{"text": "Powerful conversational models like ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) and Claude (Anthropic, 2023) are transforming products and daily life.  A key factor in their success is the underlying language model. State-of-the-art foundation models are typically pre-trained on massive, diverse, high-quality corpora encompassing sources like Wikipedia, scientific papers, community forums, GitHub code, web pages, and more (Gao et al., 2021; Together, 2023a).  A powerful foundational language model should possess comprehensive and balanced capabilities, including language understanding, commonsense reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and language generation (Bubeck et al., 2023). This work focuses on the mathematical reasoning capabilities of foundational language models (Chern et al., 2023; Azerbayev et al., 2023b, among others), which can potentially enhance applications like educational tools, automated problem-solving, data analysis, and code programming, thereby improving user experience.  Rather than building a new model, we focus on a more fundamental aspect: creating a high-quality, diverse pre-training corpus tailored for mathematics, called MATH-PILE.  Our work differs significantly from previous efforts in the following ways (see Table 1 for a comparison):\n\n**Math-Centric:** Existing open-source pre-training corpora typically focus on general domains, like Pile (Gao et al., 2021), Red-Pajama (Together, 2023a), and Dolma (AllenAI, 2023). Others concentrate on multilingual aspects or programming languages, such as ROOTS (Laurençon et al., 2022) and The Stack (Kocetkov et al., 2022), respectively.  A notable gap is a corpus specifically tailored for mathematics. While some corpora exist for training or improving math-specific language models, such as Minerva's mathematical training dataset (Lewkowycz et al., 2022) and OpenAI's MathMix (Lightman et al., 2023), these are not open-source.  A recent concurrent work, OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), is math-centric but solely sourced from web pages. We will discuss this comparison later.  Our work aims to bridge this gap by developing an open-source mathematical corpus, democratizing access to high-quality mathematical data, and enabling researchers and developers to advance mathematical reasoning in language models more effectively and inclusively.\n\n**Diversity:**  Hendrycks et al. (2021b) introduced AMPS, a problem set ranging from elementary mathematics to multivariable calculus (K-12 level) for pre-training. However, it lacks college-level and more challenging competition-level mathematics, focusing on a supervised dataset rather than an extensive corpus. ProofPile (Azerbayev et al., 2023a) aims to improve autoformalization and formal proving capabilities, but its scope is limited to formal proving.  OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023) comprises mathematical web pages. Our corpus goes further, integrating high-quality mathematics textbooks, lecture notes, arXiv papers in mathematics, and carefully selected content from StackExchange, ProofWiki, and Wikipedia, making it a richer and more diverse resource.\n\n**High-Quality:** Recent studies (Allamanis, 2019; Luccioni and Viviano, 2021; Lee et al., 2022; Hernandez et al., 2022; Longpre et al., 2023) highlight the detrimental effects of low-quality and repeated content in pre-training corpora.  Properly filtered and deduplicated web data can yield models as powerful as those trained on curated corpora (Penedo et al., 2023), a practice adopted in several notable studies (Cerebras, 2023; AllenAI, 2023; Together, 2023b). One example is the 1.3 billion-parameter code-focused model trained on synthetically generated textbooks and filtered web pages (Gunasekar et al., 2023), which broke existing scaling laws but did not open-source its data.  Corpus quality is more important than quantity. OpenAI's MathMix, for instance, comprises only 1.5 billion tokens. We adhere to the \"less is more\" principle (Zhou et al., 2023), undertaking extensive preprocessing, filtering, cleaning, and deduplication to achieve high quality. We are committed to continually refining and optimizing this corpus.\n\n**Data Documentation:** Auditing large-scale pre-training corpora, including documenting data characteristics, intended uses, information content, and potential biases, is crucial (Bender and Friedman, 2018; Gebru et al., 2021; McMillan-Major et al., 2023).  Despite this, many corpora are released without detailed documentation (Mitchell et al., 2022).  Recent audits of publicly available pre-training datasets have revealed potential issues like useless content (Luccioni and Viviano, 2021; Kreutzer et al., 2022; Elazar et al., 2023), copyright violations (Bandy and Vincent, 2021), and inclusion of downstream task test sets (Allamanis, 2019; Dodge et al., 2021).  Following best practices for transparency, we provide a datasheet for MATH-PILE (see Table 5).  Throughout our data processing workflow, numerous documents were annotated for quality, including language identification scores and symbol-to-word ratios (see Figure 4). These annotations allow users to apply custom filters.\n\n*(The provided mathematical excerpt appears out of place and unrelated to the preceding text about the corpus.

{"text": "Pregroups and special Frobenius algebras, often called \"spiders\" due to their distinctive normal form (38), are algebraic structures with surprisingly broad applications.  Pregroups underpin modern categorial grammars [15, 35, 38, 61], while spiders appear in diverse fields from topological quantum field theories and group representations to linear algebra, computability, and complexity [23, 34, 56, 57, 59, 65].  The two structures have been combined in computational linguistics, using pregroups for syntactic representation and spiders for vector space semantics [49, 62, 63]. String diagram notation has facilitated this integration at different levels of language modeling, offering a promising path towards unifying the distributional and compositional paradigms of natural language processing [8, 18, 24, 28].\n\nCentral to the theory of pregroups is Lambek's Switching Lemma [38, Prop. 2], a form of cut elimination for free pregroup sequents [40, Ch. 27].  This lemma states that any sequent in a free pregroup can be normalized so that all contraction steps precede all expansion steps."}

Correlation matrices, which capture pairwise similarity of often temporally evolving signals, describe system interactions within these fields.

Markowitz's portfolio theory in mathematical finance [5, 6], another key method, minimizes the variance of financial returns for a given expected return. Relatedly, random matrix theory has been a crucial tool for analyzing economic and other correlation matrix data for decades [6].\n\nNumerous newer methods have also emerged.  These include detrended cross-correlation analysis [7][8][9], correlation dependency (defined as the difference between partial and Pearson correlation coefficients) [10, 11], identifying optimal paths within correlation matrix data [12], and early warning signals for anticipating abrupt changes in dynamical systems, including networked systems [13][14][15]. Energy landscape analysis, particularly used in neuroscience [16, 17], also offers another approach.\n\nOver the past two decades, network science and graph theory have provided powerful tools for analyzing correlational data.  A correlation matrix can be mapped onto a correlation network, where nodes represent elements and edge weights reflect correlation strength.  Correlation network analysis aims to extract information like interaction patterns or node rankings. Ideally, this approach leverages network science concepts in a way that generates insights beyond those provided by standard correlation matrix methods like PCA.  While correlation doesn't necessarily imply a direct physical connection or interaction, correlation matrices often serve as a readily available proxy when direct connection data is scarce."}

Thierry Moungalla, porte-parole du gouvernement du Congo-Brazzaville, a défendu la politique du chef de l'État congolais.  L'interview de Louis Aliot, dont voici une analyse, aborde les relations franco-africaines, la politique migratoire et la situation au Mali.\n\n**Relations franco-africaines et critique de Denis Sassou-Nguesso:**\n\nInterrogé sur les changements envisagés en cas de victoire de Marine Le Pen, Louis Aliot a promis une \"remise à plat\" des relations franco-africaines, la fin de la \"Françafrique\" et des négociations fermes avec les chefs d'État africains ne respectant pas les droits humains.  Il a pointé du doigt le cas du Congo-Brazzaville, critiquant l'emprisonnement d'opposants politiques, l'assignation à résidence et la répression dans les régions hostiles au pouvoir.  Aliot estime que la France a les moyens de faire pression dans ce genre de situation et aurait exigé le respect de la Constitution congolaise. Il a reproché aux gouvernements français précédents de ne pas avoir joué franc-jeu.\n\n**Politique migratoire:**\n\nAccusant Emmanuel Macron d'être le candidat de la \"submersion migratoire\", Louis Aliot a défendu le programme du Front National, qui prévoit la fin de la double nationalité pour les Africains (à l'avenir), la fin de la régularisation des sans-papiers et un contrôle accru de l'immigration.  Il a justifié cette position en affirmant que certains immigrés africains sont confrontés à la marginalisation, la délinquance et la drogue, et souhaiteraient retourner dans leur pays d'origine.  Il a également reconnu que d'autres sont intégrés et ne posent aucun problème.\n\n**Intervention au Mali:**\n\nConcernant le refus de certains pays africains, dont le Mali, de signer des accords de réadmission des migrants, Aliot a défendu une politique du \"donnant-donnant\". Il a rappelé l'intervention française au Mali, affirmant que sans elle, le pays se serait effondré face à la menace djihadiste. Il estime donc légitime d'exiger le retour des clandestins dans leur pays d'origine, notamment lorsque la France a investi dans la sécurité de ces pays.\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nL’intervention de Louis Aliot sur RFI dessine les grandes lignes de la politique africaine du Front National, marquée par une volonté de rupture avec les pratiques passées, une position ferme sur les questions migratoires et une approche pragmatique de la coopération sécuritaire.  Ces propositions suscitent des controverses et interrogent sur leur faisabilité et leurs conséquences.\n\n\nThis restructured version groups thematically related ideas, enhancing coherence and readability.  It also provides a brief introduction and conclusion to frame the discussion. The chronological order of the original interview has been abandoned in favor of a thematic organization."}

{"text": "Integrating Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology into schools offers valuable classroom insights. By detecting often subtle student cues, FACS can provide teachers with feedback on lesson effectiveness and student emotional well-being.  However, it's crucial to ensure this technology respects students' privacy and doesn't intrude on their personal feelings.  FACS can enhance teaching by providing in-depth analysis of student comprehension, reactions, and areas where teachers can adapt their approach for optimal learning outcomes.\n\nStudent expressions of fatigue or anticipation, particularly at the beginning or end of the school day, can sometimes be misinterpreted by teachers as disengagement with the lesson.  Integrating FACS into school computers allows for the tracking of students' emotional responses during online activities and assignments, providing insights into their attentiveness. By comparing facial expressions against a neutral baseline, teachers gain a clearer understanding of student reactions.  While tiredness or excitement can sometimes mask true engagement, FACS, using video imagery and analysis of characteristic facial muscle movements associated with six basic emotions, offers a more objective assessment of student responses to lessons.\n\nAnother valuable application of FACS lies in identifying student confusion or boredom, both indicators of a mismatch between task difficulty and student ability. While teachers strive to support struggling students and challenge those who are bored, these emotions are not always readily apparent.  Students, especially when confused, may hide their struggles to avoid embarrassment. FACS technology can detect subtle muscle movements indicative of these emotions, even when students attempt to conceal them.  This allows teachers to identify students requiring additional support or lesson modifications, tailoring instruction to individual needs and ensuring appropriate levels of challenge.\n\nFurthermore, FACS can play a role in addressing bullying and depression within schools. By recognizing signs of fear or sadness, the technology can provide early warning signs of potential problems.  Even attempts to mask these emotions, such as forced smiles, can be detected by the system.  This offers a valuable tool in a time when student mental health is a critical concern.  Consistent monitoring and reporting of these emotional cues can provide a crucial lifeline for students who might not otherwise seek help.\n\nWhile the benefits of FACS are significant, it's essential to implement safeguards to protect student privacy. With the increasing prevalence of take-home devices, clear boundaries must be established to ensure FACS data is used solely for educational purposes and does not infringe on students' personal lives."}

This particular full moon is even more significant as it's a supermoon undergoing a total lunar eclipse, a truly spectacular triple celestial event. While everyone will feel the effects, some zodiac signs will experience them more profoundly.\n\nTo understand the astrological implications, Bustle spoke with astrologer Lisa Stardust.  Stardust explains that this full moon in Leo \"will bring inner truths to light, elevating our desire for autonomy and independence\" for everyone, regardless of their sign.  Therefore, scheduling some alone time to enjoy the lunar event is recommended for an optimal experience. Consider this your official excuse to embrace your inner witch and howl at the wolf moon solo.\n\nThis triple-whammy moon show, visible across North, Central, and South America, begins at 9:35 p.m. ET on January 20 and concludes at 2:50 a.m. ET on January 21.  During this time, the moon will pass into Earth's shadow, creating a captivating red glow.  While all full moons are worth observing, the wolf moon's visual spectacle makes it particularly noteworthy.  So, set your alarms!\n\nStardust predicts the following signs will feel the full moon's effects most strongly:\n\n* **Taurus:**  Prepare for a transformative period.  Stardust advises focusing on meditation and reflecting on your values, as \"this eclipse will change your inner beliefs, bringing personal truths to light.\" Embrace the changes with patience, kindness, and honesty towards yourself.\n\n* **Leo:** If you've been seeking motivation for independence and action, this full moon will provide the needed boost.  \"The eclipse will bring a new beginning to you, allowing you to assert yourself and find your own independence,\" says Stardust.  Embrace this opportunity to focus on yourself.\n\n* **Scorpio:** Anticipate progress in your professional life, but also be prepared for potential envy.

{"text": "Deep neural networks, with their characteristically deep, multi-layered structure, have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision and natural language processing.  A key challenge in leveraging these architectures lies in efficiently transforming and fusing information across these numerous layers.  Neural Machine Translation (NMT) exemplifies this challenge, with self-attention-based systems (Vaswani et al., 2017) now achieving state-of-the-art performance and training speed, surpassing previous recurrent neural network architectures (Wu et al., 2016) like those used in earlier successful NMT systems (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Luong et al., 2015).\n\nHowever, standard Transformer models typically utilize only the top encoder and decoder layers, neglecting potentially valuable information embedded in other layers.  Previous work (Shi et al., 2016) has shown that different layers of the encoder capture different types of syntactic information, both local and global.  Fusing information from these various layers has proven beneficial in both computer vision (Yu et al., 2018) and natural language processing tasks (Shen et al., 2018; Dou et al., 2018).  This work builds upon these findings, introducing a more efficient approach to cross-layer information fusion.\n\nSpecifically, we propose residual tree aggregation of layers (RTAL), a method inspired by techniques from numerical analysis (Peters et al., 2018; He et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017).  RTAL utilizes a post-order binary tree structure with residual connections to combine layer outputs, effectively addressing the limitations of standard NMT models by incorporating information from all layers. The residual connections further enrich the information flow within the tree. We also explore various aggregation formulas to optimize performance.\n\nOur contributions are threefold:\n\n* We introduce RTAL, a novel approach for fusing information across layers, addressing the limitations of standard NMT models that rely solely on the top encoder and decoder layers. The residual connections within RTAL enhance information flow and representation learning.\n* RTAL is efficient, easy to implement, and generalizable to arbitrary multi-layer deep neural networks.\n* This work further strengthens the growing body of research (Dou et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018) demonstrating the potential of cross-layer information fusion in natural language processing."}

{"text": "In recent years, both industry and academia [8] have widely adopted Virtual Reality (VR) training applications.  Despite this growth, few systems incorporate procedures for assessing user progress within the immersive environment.  Existing systems often evaluate only trivial tasks or require substantial reviewer time [6].  Meanwhile, the demand for real-time, automated evaluation of user actions is steadily increasing.  State-of-the-art methods for similar tasks either necessitate the development of complex, task-specific computer vision algorithms [10] or only support very simple tasks [4].\n\nThis work proposes a deep learning-based system capable of assessing user actions in real-time within a VR training scenario.  The method facilitates rapid development of trained assessment functions by leveraging data augmentation to minimize the required amount of labeled data.  Furthermore, transfer learning allows these assessment functions to be reconfigured for similar tasks, further reducing the training data needs.  This paper presents the results of our method applied to the task of tearing a deformable 3D model [3].\n\nVarious machine and deep learning algorithms [1, 7] were considered and compared (see Table 1).  Ultimately, our proposed model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a dataset created using a data augmentation technique [2]."}
{"text": "The \"Face on Mars\" is a natural landform, not an alien creation.  While some speculate about extraterrestrial origins, it's simply a geological feature formed by natural processes over time.  There's no evidence of alien involvement.  While NASA continues to investigate Martian features, their use of the word \"might\" regarding potential alien involvement doesn't confirm extraterrestrial influence.  It simply acknowledges the possibility, not the certainty.\n\nClaims that NASA is trying to convince the public of alien involvement are unfounded.  Analyzing Martian images takes time and careful study. The extended period to analyze the \"Face on Mars\" images doesn't imply alien construction, but rather the complexity of scientific investigation.  It's unreasonable to expect immediate conclusions about such complex phenomena.\n\nThe available evidence strongly suggests that the \"Face on Mars\" is a natural formation. I've presented arguments supporting this conclusion.  While individuals are free to maintain their beliefs, the scientific evidence points towards a natural explanation.  Should future Mars missions discover evidence of extraterrestrial life, that would change the current understanding. However, until such evidence is found, the most plausible explanation remains a natural geological formation."}
{"text": "Time-varying or nonlinear (non-LTI) electromagnetic structures exhibit unique behaviors beyond the capabilities of their linear time-invariant (LTI) counterparts. Examples of non-LTI antenna systems include active and non-Foster matching [1–3], direct antenna modulation [4–6], and time-varying loading with modulation rates comparable to the carrier or antenna resonant frequency (as opposed to the symbol rate) [7–11]. These methods involve locally time-varying or nonlinear loading, while the effects of distributed time-variation, i.e., space-time modulated materials, have also been explored [12–19].\n\nModeling these structures typically relies on time-domain techniques like FDTD, transient circuit co-simulation, and the time-domain method of moments [20].  While accurate and general, these methods have drawbacks that motivate alternative strategies [21]. For example, transient analyses offer limited opportunities for partial simulation re-use between variations of time-varying properties.  Furthermore, they don't directly represent frequency-domain phenomena like steady-state radiated power and network parameters, common metrics in LTI system design, although these can be derived via Fourier transformations.  In contrast, frequency-domain techniques often allow significant simulation re-use and naturally align with these frequency-domain metrics.  The direct connection between the method of moments (MoM) and the dyadic Green's function makes it particularly advantageous for applications like modal current analysis [22, 23], automated design synthesis [24–26], and developing fundamental bounds on LTI system performance [27, 28]. Extending these benefits to a method compatible with linear, time-varying system analysis could greatly accelerate the study of non-LTI electromagnetic structures in similar applications.\n\nTo address this need, we hybridize MoM with existing frequency-domain methods for time-varying circuit analysis, specifically using conversion matrices to transform a MoM-based scattering problem into one involving an LTI N-port network interfaced with time-varying subcircuits.  Prior work on hybridizing MoM with conversion matrix solvers is limited, focusing on special cases with sparse lumped loading.  Studies [29, 30] used time-varying and nonlinear circuit analysis techniques (conversion matrices and harmonic balance) to model a single load at an antenna's feed point. By collapsing the antenna to a lumped impedance, this method is efficient but restricts loading to a single location.  In [31], a similar conversion matrix/MoM (CMMoM) hybridization treated a periodic structure with periodically time-varying loads, again focusing on sparse lumped loading. While useful and reflective of common practice, these methods don't readily generalize to systems with multiple loads or distributed time-varying properties.  Modeling time-varying material properties within an analytical context equivalent to CMMoM has been explored, but is limited to conducting cylinders [32].\n\nBuilding on preliminary studies [33], we develop a generalized CMMoM method accommodating multiple lumped and distributed spatiotemporal loading of arbitrarily shaped electromagnetic structures."}

{"text": "Score-based diffusion models (SBDMs) have garnered significant attention for data generation.  These models perturb target data into Gaussian noise via a diffusion process and learn the reverse process to reconstruct the original data. Conditional SBDMs, incorporating guidance such as class labels, text, or low-resolution images, have demonstrated considerable success in image generation and translation.  Traditional conditional SBDMs rely on paired data, where each target sample has a corresponding condition, for example, a high-resolution image paired with its low-resolution counterpart in super-resolution. However, obtaining sufficient paired training data can be challenging in real-world applications due to labeling costs.  Therefore, developing SBDMs that can leverage unpaired or partially paired training data is crucial, particularly for tasks like unpaired or semi-paired image-to-image translation (I2I).\n\nWhile several SBDM-based approaches exist for unpaired I2I, they often employ unconditional score-based models, imposing conditions during inference through techniques like cycle consistency, initial state design, or guidance terms.  Training *conditional* score-based models directly with unpaired data remains an open question.  Furthermore, few SBDMs address the partially paired scenario, where a limited amount of paired data is available alongside a larger unpaired dataset.\n\nThis paper addresses the challenge of training conditional score-based models with unpaired or partially paired data, focusing on I2I applications where condition and target data are images from different domains.  The key challenges are twofold: (1) the absence of a direct relationship between condition and target data hinders training, and (2) even with an estimated relationship, it's unclear how to train the model effectively without explicit condition-target pairs.\n\nTo address these challenges, we introduce the Optimal Transport-guided Conditional Score-based diffusion model (OTCS).  Unlike existing OT-related SBDMs that focus on understanding or enhancing *unconditional* models, OTCS leverages optimal transport (OT) to enable *conditional* SBDM training with unpaired or partially paired data.\n\nFor unpaired settings, such as unpaired super-resolution, we utilize unsupervised OT to model the coupling relationship between condition and target data.  This approach aligns with the common practice of translating condition data to the target domain while preserving image structure."}

The software, as described, can \"recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" allowing teachers to address learning difficulties in real-time. This immediate feedback loop offers a significant advantage over traditional methods of gauging student comprehension.  Furthermore, the software's potential extends beyond monitoring engagement.  By analyzing facial expressions, it can inform instructors about a student's emotional state, enabling them to adapt their teaching methods for optimal effectiveness.  Dr. Huang's observation that the software \"could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,\" underscores its potential to personalize learning and enhance educational outcomes.  Additionally, the technology could help identify instances of dishonesty, such as a student falsely claiming to have completed online assignments, facilitating timely intervention and resolution.\n\nBeyond the classroom, this technology holds immense promise for the medical field.  The ability to \"construct a 3-D computer model of the face [with] all 44 major muscles,\" as described in the text, offers a powerful tool for aspiring doctors to learn and understand human anatomy. This detailed visualization could revolutionize medical education, providing a more engaging and comprehensive learning experience than traditional methods. While some might argue that this knowledge can be acquired through other means, the software's interactive nature provides a distinct advantage.\n\nWhile the text notes that \"we humans perform this same impressive calculation every day\" by interpreting facial expressions, this technology offers a more nuanced and precise understanding.  We already infer emotional states from facial cues in our daily interactions with friends and family, but this software can enhance our innate abilities, providing a deeper insight into the complexities of human emotion.

If that number represented wealth, I'd be set; if it was a golf score, I’d quit. But as a measure of importance in the global supply chain, it meant comfortable anonymity.  I never waited long for anything, never heard “no.”  The International Quartermaster's Consortium (IQC) – the folks who dole out resources based on your International Individual Rankings Bureau (IIRB) rank – happily fulfilled my requests for extra water or discounted beef.  5,000,000,001 was a good place to be.\n\nThen my StrapRank (tm) – the wristband assigned at birth that displays your IIRB rank – buzzed.  Usually, a minor fluctuation. Births, deaths, the usual.  But this time, it flashed #500,000,000.  An impossible leap. I assumed a malfunction, blamed the shower steam.  I continued getting ready for work, dismissing the rapidly changing numbers: 734,000… then 425,924… plummeting faster than Brendan Fraser’s career.\n\nFinally, I called the IIRB.  After navigating the bureaucratic phone tree, I reached a bored voice, explained my situation.  The voice suddenly sharpened. \"How long ago did it start?\"  I was put on hold. My rank: 250,000.\n\nA new voice, Anthony, an IIRB technician, answered. He was investigating similar reports.  He asked for my current rank.  “250,000,” I said, still convinced my StrapRank was broken.  Outside, sirens wailed – a common sound since the 7-billion-bracket crowd moved into my neighborhood.\n\nAnthony explained how the StrapRanks worked: activated by your heartbeat, reporting to the IIRB database, which calculates and displays your rank.  “Right,” I said, “but why is mine plummeting?”\n\n“Everyone gets more important when there are less of us.”  His tone was flat, disturbingly calm.  He asked for my rank again.  “19.”  Two digits that suddenly held immense weight.\n\n\"Mine shows #18,\" Anthony said, \"and I'm the last one in this office. I don’t know how much longer we have.”  I heard the clink of glass, the sigh of someone taking a stiff drink. \"Your wristband isn't malfunctioning. The human race is disappearing.\"\n\nI looked out the window.  Driverless cars littered the streets. Empty strollers. A lone birthday balloon drifted by. In the distance, a plane descended too low, then vanished.

These parties aim to leverage potential National Assembly seats to push for crucial policy and legal reforms.\n\nANUG Chairman, Timothy Jonas, confirmed securing the support of the Federal United Party (FED-UP) for the March 2, 2020, general elections.  However, other parties, including Lenox Shuman’s Liberty and Justice Party (LJP), remain unconvinced.\n\nJonas stated that ANUG and FED-UP would jointly contest the elections, though their combined name and ballot symbol will be announced later this week following a joint press conference.  He acknowledged that ANUG’s individual identity might not be fully retained but downplayed concerns, drawing a parallel with the Alliance For Change (AFC).  \"As subsumed as the AFC has become, they are still identifiable.  Similarly, these two standalone, self-sufficient parties will work together without fear of losing their identities.\"\n\nANUG Assistant Secretary, Kian Jabour, highlighted FED-UP's interest in developing a constituency system where parliamentarians are directly accountable to their constituents.  \"We firmly believe our current parliamentary system doesn't represent all Guyanese.  The majority of seats are allocated by political parties, creating 'yes-men' who must adhere to party lines, as evidenced by recent events surrounding the no-confidence motion.\"\n\nWhile acknowledging the shared good intentions of smaller parties, Jabour noted that many haven't embraced the strategic advantage of a unified campaign. Jonas praised The New Movement, a group of young professionals he described as \"good-hearted, sincere people who want the best for Guyana,\" urging public support despite some of their ideas being arguably unrealistic.\n\nHe confirmed ongoing discussions with the Citizenship Initiative, stating, \"Members of our executives have spoken; the outcome remains uncertain.\"  He also mentioned that ANUG has not yet engaged with Robert Badal’s Change Guyana party.\n\nJonas realistically acknowledged the difficulty of small parties winning outright in Guyana but emphasized their potential to hold the balance of power in the 65-seat National Assembly.  He pointed to the over 30,000 independent voters, previously AFC supporters, now seeking a genuine third-party alternative. \"Mathematically, if these parties compete amongst themselves for these independent voters, each will likely receive less than 5,000 votes.\" He criticized the tendency of small parties to make unrealistic campaign promises despite the prevailing reality of race-based voting.\n\nANUG's primary focus, according to Jonas, is to act as a broker for effective legislation, sound policies, and constitutional reform. \"With approximately 80% of the population voting along ethnic lines, we must be realistic.  Making promises about governing would be deceptive."}

{"text": "The field of robotics often grapples with the complexities of motion planning, a search problem made challenging by the geometric and implicit nature of the configuration space (c-space).  Sampling-based motion planning (SBMP) algorithms address this by using random sampling and local extensions within the continuous c-space to find collision-free paths.  These algorithms often implicitly employ guided search, a concept we make explicit in this work.\n\nEarly SBMP algorithms, like Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) [23], demonstrated the effectiveness of exploration guided by Voronoi bias, particularly in environments without narrow passages.  Subsequent research often focused on navigating these challenging narrow passages [3, 28] or on optimizing path quality, such as maximizing clearance [16].  Due to the inherent complexity of motion planning, improvements frequently relied on environment-specific heuristics encoded by engineers.\n\nThis paper formalizes the previously implicit notion of guidance by defining guiding spaces and guided search. A guiding space is an auxiliary space used to estimate the value of exploring different configurations, informing the exploration strategy of our proposed general guided search algorithm.  This definition is inherently hierarchical, as any search space (including c-space itself) can serve as a guiding space.  Intuitively, guidance represents the bias introduced into the exploration process, analogous to the heuristic guidance used by A* in discrete search spaces, but applied within the continuous c-space.\n\nBy explicitly defining guiding spaces, we uncover the underlying guidance mechanisms within seemingly disparate existing methods.  These methods can be categorized into three main groups: robot modification, environment modification, and experience-based guidance. This perspective simplifies and clarifies the conceptual contributions of various algorithms, facilitating generalized implementations and their composition.\n\nFraming SBMP algorithms within this common language of guiding spaces enables a novel evaluation method focused on the quality of guidance.  We adopt an information-theoretic approach, where the guidance computation procedure provides information to the search process.  Experimental results across various algorithms and environments confirm the intuitive suitability of certain algorithms for specific c-space features.  Furthermore, this metric reveals algorithmic properties that traditional metrics like runtime or sample count often obscure.  By measuring guidance quality locally, we gain insights into the benefits of combining guiding spaces, demonstrated by a hybrid guiding space that outperforms its individual components."}
{"text": "The ability of computers to recognize human emotions promises a radical shift in our interaction with technology and the world around us. Imagine a computer so attuned to your emotional responses that it can anticipate your needs and desires.  For example, while online shopping, a fleeting expression of disgust at a bright yellow shirt could prompt the computer to instantly replace it with a blue alternative. This seamless adaptation to our emotional state could lead to greater satisfaction and a more personalized experience.\n\nThis technology, as exemplified by the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), offers intriguing possibilities.  The essay mentions FACS's analysis of the Mona Lisa, providing precise percentages for the emotions conveyed in the portrait. This level of emotional quantification offers a fascinating glimpse into the mind of Leonardo da Vinci.  By analyzing these percentages, we can speculate about his emotional state during the painting process. Was her predominantly happy expression a reflection of his own disposition?  This technology opens exciting new avenues for research and analysis, providing insights into historical figures and their thought processes in a way never before possible.  It's a window into the past, allowing us to explore not just what was done, but potentially what was felt and thought.\n\nHowever, the implications of such technology extend beyond historical analysis.  The constant monitoring required for accurate emotional recognition raises concerns about privacy and personal space.  The feeling of being perpetually observed, even by a machine, could be unsettling and lead to feelings of anxiety and paranoia.  This constant surveillance, while not involving a human observer, mirrors the anxieties surrounding webcam hacking, but in a more pervasive and overt manner.  The system, by its very nature, is always watching, and this could be a significant deterrent for many.\n\nDespite these potential drawbacks, the potential benefits of FACS are compelling."}
{"text": "In many real-world applications, such as education, healthcare, and autonomous driving, collecting data through online interaction is expensive or even dangerous.  However, previously collected logged datasets, generated by unknown policies, are often available in these domains. Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn effective agent policies directly from these datasets, without further online interaction (Lange et al., 2012; Levine et al., 2020).  Many online RL algorithms, including value-based methods (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Ghasemipour et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2019; Jaques et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2020; Fujimoto & Gu, 2021; Kostrikov et al., 2021a) and model-based methods (Yu et al., 2020; Kidambi et al., 2020), have been adapted for offline settings. The key challenge for these methods lies in generalizing value or dynamics to state-action pairs outside the offline dataset.\n\nBehavioral cloning (BC) (Bain & Sammut, 1995) offers an alternative approach to offline RL.  Originally developed for imitation learning, where the goal is mimicking expert demonstrations, BC is a supervised learning technique.  Recent work has formulated offline RL as a supervised learning problem (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021; Emmons et al., 2021).  Because offline RL datasets typically lack expert demonstrations, these approaches condition BC on additional context, such as returns and goals, to specify target outcomes. Empirical evidence suggests that these conditional BC approaches are competitive with value-based methods, benefiting from the simplicity and training stability of supervised learning.\n\nSince maximum returns in offline trajectories are often significantly lower than desired expert returns, policies are expected to extrapolate beyond the offline data by conditioning on out-of-distribution (OOD) expert returns. Ideally, the policy would achieve the desired outcomes, even if unseen during training, resulting in a linear relationship between achieved and target returns (Figure 1a).  However, current methods fall short of this ideal.  Performance typically peaks near the maximum return within the dataset, closely tracking the target return up to that point, then dropping sharply when conditioned on higher returns (Figure 1b).\n\nWe systematically analyze this unreliability, demonstrating its dependence on both offline data quality and the architecture of the return-conditioned policy. The green line represents the maximum return in the offline dataset, while the orange line represents the expert return. The ideal scenario (Figure 1a) is difficult or impossible to achieve with suboptimal offline data. Return-conditioned RL methods can exhibit unreliable generalization (Figure 1b), with performance declining rapidly beyond the dataset maximum. Our goal is to ensure reliable generalization (Figure 1c), even when conditioning on OOD returns.\n\nWe observe that offline datasets are generally suboptimal; even within the range of observed returns, the distribution is often non-uniform and concentrated on low-return trajectories. This impacts reliability, as we are primarily concerned with conditioning on returns near or above the observed dataset maximum. While filtering low-return trajectories is a straightforward solution, it can reduce data efficiency by eliminating a substantial portion of the dataset.\n\nRegarding architecture, existing BC methods exhibit different behaviors when conditioning on OOD returns."}
{"text": "The \"Face on Mars\" has sparked curiosity and debate since its discovery in 1976.  A photo taken that year, and later images, including one from 2001, revealed a rock formation resembling a human face.  This led some scientists to speculate about the possibility of extraterrestrial origins, suggesting it could be evidence of alien life on Mars. However, many scientists, myself included, believe it is simply a natural rock formation.  Its appearance is due to natural processes and the play of shadows, creating the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. As NASA stated when they released the image, it is a huge rock formation that resembles a human head due to these shadows.\n\nThe scientific community remains divided. Roughly half believe the \"Face on Mars\" is a naturally occurring landform, while the other half entertain the possibility of it being an artifact of some kind.  \n\nPersonally, I remain convinced it's a rock. Rocks are enduring and don't simply disappear.  However, I acknowledge the question of how a rock's appearance could change over time.  Perhaps the unique conditions of the Martian environment, different from Earth, could contribute to such changes.\n\nUltimately, it's a strangely shaped rock. Rocks come in countless shapes and sizes, each unique and some quite unusual.  There's a wide variety of rock types, both on Earth and in space."}

{"text": "The author should continue studying Venus despite its dangers.  Current knowledge of Venus reveals a hostile environment: an atmosphere composed of 97% carbon dioxide, shrouded in sulfuric acid clouds.  The surface pressure is 90 times that of Earth, and despite Mercury's proximity to the Sun, Venus boasts the highest average surface temperature in our solar system.\n\nThis extreme environment explains the difficulty in exploring Venus.  No spacecraft has survived on the surface for more than a few hours, likely due to the intense conditions.  This explains the absence of a long-term lander on Venus for over three decades. However, this lack of sustained exploration doesn't signify surrender.  Scientists are actively seeking solutions to this technological challenge.\n\nNASA, for example, is exploring innovative approaches to studying Venus.  Sending humans presents significant difficulties, as any mission would likely be limited to orbiting the planet, precluding direct sample collection like rock or gas retrieval.  Currently, image capture remains the primary method of remote study.\n\nDespite these obstacles, continued exploration of Venus remains crucial.  The author's pursuit of understanding this enigmatic planet should be encouraged, even in the face of daunting challenges."}
{"text": "Termination analysis, a classic problem in computability theory, aims to determine whether a program will halt.  Its importance is underscored by applications like software testing, where non-termination leads to infinite executions.  As Turing proved in 1936, no general algorithm can solve the termination problem for all program-input pairs [60].  While extensive research exists on termination analysis, most approaches rely on formal symbolic reasoning [15, 22, 23, 25, 33, 36].\n\nRecent efforts have explored using neural networks to estimate termination behavior.  For example, Giacobbe et al. [29] trained neural networks as ranking functions, mapping the program's state space to well-ordered sets.  Similarly, Abate et al. [3] used a neural network to fit ranking supermartingales over execution traces.  These approaches, aiming for formal guarantees, leverage satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers to validate their results.  However, they inherit limitations inherent to formal symbolic methods, such as the need to translate programs into symbolic representations and the potential for undecidable logical fragments or reliance on additional program invariants.\n\nThis paper departs from formal methods, embracing the stochastic nature of machine learning models.  Instead of seeking rigorous formal guarantees, we aim to estimate a program's termination behavior and localize potential non-termination causes for debugging.  This work also explores the applicability of machine learning techniques from other domains to program analysis.  Specifically, we utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [66] and Graph Attention Networks (GANs) [61], as detailed below.\n\nUnlike previous work focusing on execution traces, we analyze source code, assuming it contains patterns indicative of termination behavior.  Mirroring traditional program analysis techniques, we operate on graph representations of programs.  We leverage GNNs, a class of neural networks designed for graph-structured data analysis, which have gained traction in diverse fields like social network analysis [65], physical systems modeling [53], knowledge graph analysis [34], and point-cloud classification [71].  GNNs have also recently been applied to program analysis tasks such as variable misuse detection, type inference [7], and self-supervised bug detection and repair [9].\n\nInspired by [7, 9], we use GNNs to estimate program termination. Our baseline classifier employs Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) [40].  However, simply estimating termination behavior provides limited debugging assistance.  Ideally, we want to pinpoint the likely root cause of non-termination, similar to fault localization techniques that rank potential causes of failure based on failing and passing test cases [41].\n\nWe explore attention and semantic segmentation mechanisms from machine learning, a novel application in the context of program analysis.  Attention, mimicking cognitive attention, highlights relevant parts of the input data.  We use attention to identify instructions influential in termination estimation, visualizing the program sections the network focuses on.  We implement a second termination classifier based on the Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture [61], anticipating improved classification compared to the GCN baseline due to the varying influence of instructions on termination.\n\nFor localizing non-termination causes, we employ semantic segmentation, typically used in image recognition to label each pixel with a class.  We apply this principle to programs, identifying statements causing non-termination.  Furthermore, we demonstrate how semantic segmentation information can be combined with program slicing to extract a non-terminating slice from the original program, simplifying debugging.\n\nOur experimental evaluation on various datasets, including custom datasets and benchmarks from software verification competitions, demonstrates strong generalization capabilities of our learned models.\n\nIn summary, this research contributes:\n\n* A GCN-based architecture for binary classification of program termination.\n* A GAT-based architecture that improves termination classification using self-attention and visualizes relevant nodes.\n* A semantic segmentation GAT that localizes nodes causing non-termination, specifically outermost infinite loops, and illustrates how this information can be used with program slicing for debugging.\n* Datasets for both classification and segmentation of program termination."}

{"text": "I am against the development of driverless cars for several reasons, primarily concerning safety, job displacement, and cost-effectiveness.\n\nMy foremost concern is safety. While proponents tout the potential for reducing human error, driverless cars are still vulnerable to unforeseen circumstances.  They cannot react to every situation with the same nuanced judgment as a human driver.  Consider scenarios like sudden black ice, unexpected road debris, or navigating complex construction zones.  A sleeping passenger (a likely occurrence when one is not actively driving) would be unable to take control quickly in such situations, potentially leading to accidents, injuries, or even fatalities.  Furthermore, the legal implications of accidents involving driverless cars are still unclear, raising the possibility of drivers being held liable for malfunctions despite not being in control.\n\nThe economic impact of widespread driverless car adoption is also troubling.  Numerous jobs directly related to driving would be lost, impacting professions like taxi drivers, truckers, delivery drivers, valet parkers, and those working in parking-related industries.  This displacement could have significant economic consequences for many families.  Furthermore, the ripple effect on the broader automotive industry, including dealerships and repair shops, could be substantial."}

{"text": "Venus, despite its currently hostile environment, presents a compelling target for scientific study.  Evidence suggests it may once have harbored bodies of water and potentially even life, making it perhaps the only other planet in our solar system capable of supporting life. While its surface now boasts a scorching average temperature of 800 degrees Fahrenheit and an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than Earth's—a combination that makes human landings virtually impossible—its past may hold vital clues to understanding planetary evolution and the conditions necessary for life.  This past is hinted at by the diverse geological features of Venus, including valleys, mountains, craters, and rocky sediment.\n\nThe extreme conditions on Venus are further exacerbated by erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes, which pose significant threats to any probes attempting to land. This intense surface heat, the hottest of any planet in our solar system, is a direct result of these geological activities.\n\nWhile landing on Venus remains impractical, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is exploring alternative approaches. One such concept involves a high-altitude vehicle, similar to a jet airplane flying above storms, which would allow scientists to observe Venus while avoiding the perilous surface conditions.\n\nHowever, this approach has limitations.  The dense Venusian atmosphere blocks most forms of light, making traditional photography and videography ineffective. More critically, remote observation prevents the collection of crucial physical samples like rocks and gases.  A truly comprehensive mission, therefore, would necessitate closer proximity to the surface, despite the inherent risks.\n\nLooking forward, the development of advanced technologies may eventually enable more detailed study of Venus, including closer observation and sample collection."}

Medication blurred my memories, leaving me with only fragmented impressions of the past, corroborated by photos and other external evidence rather than genuine recollection.  Details are lost to me; the past is a single, indistinct blur.\n\nTwo memories, however, pierce through the fog.  The first is from when I was six. My uncle, a rare visitor, knocked frantically at the window while I watched TV. My sister was upstairs asleep.  Fear contorted my uncle's face. I let him in, the number 7 screaming in my mind.\n\nMonths later, I found myself in a courtroom, clutching a doll. The judge questioned me about the doll and my uncle. My family wept. The gavel fell.

Can you help me out this once, please?\" Dean pleaded.\n\n\"Sorry, I don't want to get in trouble.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Smith doesn't even read the essays,\" Dean whispered conspiratorially. \"Rumor is her husband is a drunk and hits her.

If you want to hang out sometime, I have a few friends who throw some killer parties.\"\n\n\"That sounds fantastic,\" I replied.\n\nLater that day, I met Charles's friends.

{"text": "The internet is a curious place.  Branded as witch-hunters, hackers, social recluses, or simply trolls, we sit in our homes, consuming news faster than traditional media can deliver it, wielding the power to shape narratives and movements—though not always for the better.\n\nIn 2016, governments worldwide embraced green initiatives, but amidst domestic funding priorities, the exploration of space, our ultimate destiny, was neglected.  Earth, after all, is a temporary home.  Extinction, in some form, is inevitable.\n\nThe collective intelligence of Reddit, seemingly anticipating this, established the \"Moon Fund\"—a thinly veiled conduit for channeling community donations directly to NASA. By 2020, the fund had reached $2.7 billion.  However, citing war and famine, governments refused to allocate these resources to space exploration during times of hardship.  But for Reddit's community, these hardships only underscored the impending fall of humanity.  Their resolve strengthened, and the fund quickly swelled to $5.7 billion.\n\nCoincidentally, this surge coincided with America's financial collapse. The president, in a desperate bid for solvency, offered Reddit ownership of the moon in exchange for the fund.  Heated debates erupted within the community.  Some questioned the fund's necessity. Others entertained grander visions: \"If we can own the moon, why not the world? The universe?\"\n\nAmidst this turmoil, a college student from India announced a groundbreaking discovery on Reddit, seeking funding for further research. The Moon Fund, recognizing the potential, hired her directly.  Fueled by their investment, she developed the first functional wormhole.\n\nWithin a year, a working prototype emerged, and a year later, the first Reddit-funded spaceship was built.  As economies crumbled, rulers rose and fell, the world teetered on the brink of apocalypse. By 2031, the day of reckoning arrived. Reddit had constructed 21 spaceships, their first destination: the moon.  A flood of people, desperate to escape a dying world, clamored for passage to the new frontier.\n\nUpon breaking orbit, the wormhole drives engaged, and in mere seconds, 21 ships appeared in lunar orbit. The flagship, *Swartz*, landed gracefully. A figure emerged, planting a flag—blue, and alien in design—proclaiming, \"One small step for man, one giant leap for the power of Reddit.\" The moon was claimed in Reddit's name, and the fleet embarked on a journey through the galaxies, seeking new worlds for humanity to explore."}

Within this static, silent sea of paused objects, a lone figure moved freely, plying his trade. He deftly lifted wallets, dollars, and other valuables from the pockets of the immobile figures.  A man of opportunity, unburdened by empathy, he was determined to exploit his unique skills to their fullest.  A jaunty whistle filled the silent void.\n\nAs the opportunistic thief worked his way down the sidewalk, he glanced up and noticed a statue seemingly settle back into place, its fabric wavering in the otherwise windless world. Unlike the others in their smooth black suits, rough blue jeans, or casual sweats and hoodies, this figure wore coarse, gray rags, bleached almost white with age, reminiscent of a monk's attire.  Its skin was completely covered, the face shrouded in darkness, save for a pair of piercing maroon eyes that stood out starkly against the silver-tinged world.  A mixture of fear and intrigue gripped the thief. What riches, what treasures, could this strange figure possess?\n\nHe cautiously approached, pausing to study the anomaly.  It was unusually tall, perhaps six foot seven, towering over the other frozen figures.  As he took another step closer, a blur of motion startled him.  A nefariously obsidian black sword, seemingly materialized from nowhere, whipped out from the figure's right arm and rested against his throat.  The maroon eyes, now intensely focused, bored into him, filling him with overwhelming dread.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he stammered.\n\n\"I am ancient,\" the figure replied, its voice firm yet barely a whisper. \"You didn't believe you were alone in this power, did you?\" It spoke without the usual inflection of a question.\n\n\"Why… why do you have me at, uh… sword-point, then?\" the thief asked, a flicker of intrigue battling his fear.\n\n\"Because, like others, you have diverted the world from its intended path,\" the figure stated emotionlessly.\n\n\"How?\" the thief asked, bewildered.\n\n\"There are consequences to your actions, consequences you blindly ignore in your self-serving pursuit of profit,\" it explained. \"Every minuscule detail, every drop of rain, every pebble, every wallet, every person… is precisely where it needs to be to ensure a future you, with your limited three-dimensional perspective, cannot comprehend.\"\n\nThe thief, utterly perplexed, struggled to grasp the situation unfolding before him.  \"I… I guess I'm sorry?\" he offered insincerely, his plea motivated solely by self-preservation."}

{"text": "Tactile perception is crucial for modern robotics, enhancing human-robot interaction and environmental awareness in autonomous robots.  Animals and humans rely heavily on tactile sensors in their skin and muscles for balance and agile movements [1], [2].  This principle, while fundamental in nature, has been less explored in legged robotics.  While visual feedback systems have received significant attention—for example, Plagemann et al.'s laser range finders for surface adaptation [3], Sabe et al.'s stereo-vision system [4], and Chen et al.'s combined infrared and ultrasound sensors [5]—tactile sensing offers a complementary approach.\n\nCurrent legged robots often utilize direct environmental feedback from sources like sonar, LIDAR, vision, and force feedback from joint actuators.  Several studies have explored alternative methods for surface estimation. These include joint position evaluation [6], Camurri et al.'s Pronto state estimator integrating RGB camera, LIDAR, and odometry data [7], Sarkisov et al.'s landing gear using foot-pad IMU orientation and joint angles [8], and Zhang et al.'s visual estimation of tactile patterns via a camera within the robot leg [9].  Furthermore, Smith et al. coupled foot contact sensors and IMU data for reinforcement learning of locomotion skills [10], and Luneckas et al. developed a hybrid tactile sensor system for obstacle navigation in hexapod robots [11].\n\nAdding tactile sensing to robot feet, mimicking the role of haptic sensing in animal locomotion, offers significant advantages for navigating challenging terrain.  Tactile sensors, like those employed in collaborative robots for enhanced environmental awareness through skin-like surfaces, can provide valuable information about surface properties when placed beneath a robot's feet.\n\nThis paper introduces the Touch Sensitive Foot (TSF), capable of recognizing surface textures using a trained CNN model.  This research provides an efficient pathway towards enhanced environmental awareness for autonomous robots, enabling predetermined gait adjustments for traversing unknown terrains.  This development mirrors the importance of tactile feedback in natural systems and offers a promising direction for improving legged robot locomotion.  The reported study was funded by RFBR and CNRS, project number 21-58-15006."}
{"text": "Serial manipulators are well-established for handling tasks in automation and production.  However, their workspace and payload are limited for large-scale applications. Cable-driven parallel robots (cable robots) overcome these limitations by using cables instead of rigid prismatic actuators to control an end-effector.  Cables, due to their flexibility and low weight, can be compactly stored on drums, enabling high maximum actuation lengths and accelerations, and thus, large workspaces. A prime example is the FAST telescope [7], a spherical radio telescope with a 600m span and a ~30-ton payload. Other applications include the Robotic Seabed Cleaning Platform (RSCP) [2] for marine litter removal and high-rack warehouse solutions [4].\n\nEfficient operation is crucial for robotic handling tasks.  Loading and unloading require high accuracy, while inter-operational movements prioritize low energy consumption over precision. For cable robots, increased platform stiffness improves accuracy but also increases energy consumption due to higher cable forces [8]. Conversely, decreased stiffness lowers energy consumption but reduces accuracy. High cable forces necessitate high motor torques and currents, resulting in high energy consumption, while low cable forces lead to lower consumption.\n\nCable robots are redundant mechanisms with *m* actuated cables, where *m* ≥ *n* + 1, and *n* represents the platform's degrees of freedom (DOFs).  Verhoeven [16] highlighted the potential of cable robots to adjust platform stiffness by modulating cable preload via the nullspace.  Kraus et al. [6] presented an energy-efficient force distribution method using a gradient vector to compute a reference force and subsequently solving the static equation via the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse. This method demonstrated lower energy consumption compared to serial kinematics with a similar operating range. However, it did not address disturbances from handling tasks (e.g., loading/unloading) or platform pose errors.  Fabritius et al. [1] introduced a nullspace-based cable force correction method to maintain predefined force limits and compensate for disturbances within the cable actuation system."}
{"text": "Petaling Jaya: Former Prime Minister Najib Razak has reportedly confirmed that Umno MPs signed statutory declarations supporting the formation of a new political coalition.  The Malaya Post quoted Najib as saying they agreed, conditionally, to Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamad's coalition. However, he did not disclose the conditions.  Speculation suggests the new coalition will be called Perikatan Nasional or Pakatan Nasional.\n\nThis confirmation coincided with significant political activity involving leaders from PPBM, PAS, Umno, and a faction of PKR aligned with Deputy President Mohamed Azmin Ali. Separate meetings were held by PPBM and Umno leaders, as well as Azmin's faction.  A large presence of VIP vehicles at Istana Negara fueled speculation about the imminent formation of a new coalition.  Leaders and MPs from PKR, PPBM, Umno, and PAS also gathered for dinner at the Sheraton Hotel in Petaling Jaya, although Mahathir was absent.\n\nMeanwhile, PKR President Anwar Ibrahim's supporters gathered at his Segambut home for prayers.  Anwar confirmed an attempt to undermine Pakatan Harapan.\n\nLater that night, Anwar met with leaders from PKR, DAP, and Amanah, the component parties of Pakatan Harapan, according to his aide. This followed intense speculation about Pakatan Harapan's collapse and the formation of a new coalition by PPBM, Umno, PAS, and some PKR members. Anwar had stated earlier that there had been an attempt to betray Pakatan Harapan, hinting at potential announcements the following day.\n\nHis political secretary, Farhash Wafa Salvador Rizal Mubarak, said the meeting's location was undisclosed.  Farhash cautioned against premature speculation about a \"backdoor government,\" stating that such efforts had not yet succeeded. \"If successful, they would have announced it,\" he told reporters outside Anwar's residence.

{"text": "Turkey's intervention in Syria's Idlib province reflects a complex interplay of alliances and rivalries, centered around the ongoing Syrian civil war and the fight against ISIS.  Late on Thursday, Turkish forces entered Idlib and began establishing observation posts, ostensibly as part of a \"de-escalation\" agreement reached with Russia and Iran in Kazakhstan last month.  This deployment, confirmed by a senior rebel involved in the operation, appears aimed at containing Kurdish forces.  The Turkish convoy of approximately 30 military vehicles entered through the Bab al-Hawa crossing and proceeded towards Sheikh Barakat, a strategic location overlooking rebel and Kurdish-held territories.\n\nThis move comes amidst escalating tensions between Turkey and the United States.  On Thursday, President Erdogan launched a verbal attack against the US, accusing them of providing weapons to the Kurdish YPG, a group Turkey considers a terrorist organization but which is a key US ally in the fight against ISIS.  He characterized Turkey's operation in Idlib, conducted with supporting rebel groups, as a serious effort to uphold the de-escalation deal. This operation aims to protect the area from attacks by Syrian government forces and Russia, as well as preventing territorial gains by Kurdish militias.  Although Turkey supports Syrian rebels and Russia backs President Assad, the two countries have been cooperating to resolve the Syrian conflict, with Erdogan and Putin holding several meetings since their 2016 reconciliation.\n\nThe Idlib de-escalation zone is one of four such zones agreed upon by Iran, Russia, and Turkey as part of the Astana peace process, which seeks to end the Syrian civil war. Three other zones—in Eastern Ghouta, central Homs, and southern Syria—are already being monitored by Russian military police.  While Idlib is largely controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a group linked to Al-Qaeda,  witnesses reported that its forces escorted the Turkish convoy, suggesting a potential understanding between the two.\n\nHowever, the US-Turkish relationship has deteriorated further following the arrest of Metin Topuz, a Turkish employee of the US consulate in Istanbul, accused of links to Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for the 2016 coup attempt.  The US has denied these charges and suspended non-immigrant visa services in Turkey, prompting a reciprocal move by Turkey. This diplomatic row adds another layer of complexity to Turkey's regional actions, potentially signaling a shift in alliances against the United States.\n\nThe Turkish operation in Idlib also highlights Turkey's evolving strategy in Syria.  While a strong supporter of anti-Assad rebels, Turkey has recently prioritized border security against both jihadists and Kurdish forces. The Astana agreement aligns with this objective by reducing conflict in key areas.  Turkey's previous military involvement in Syria was the eight-month Euphrates Shield operation in Aleppo, targeting both ISIS and Kurdish militias.  The current Idlib intervention underscores Turkey’s determination to maintain influence and security in the region, even as its relationships with traditional allies become increasingly strained."}

Esta misma resolución también modifica el porcentaje de corte de biocombustibles en el gasoil.  Se redujo del 10% al 5% en enero, para luego incrementarse progresivamente al 6,7% en febrero, 8% en marzo y retornar al 10% en abril.

{"text": "Simulating and modeling processes and workflows is a common technique for studying and predicting application performance without executing them under all possible parameter settings.  Two popular frameworks for estimating the runtime costs of HPC applications and workflows are SimGrid [1] and WRENCH [2]. These frameworks focus on modeling computation time and process interdependencies arising from network traffic and message exchange.  Another critical performance factor is input/output (I/O), which SimGrid and WRENCH address at a coarse level. However, for realistic I/O behavior modeling, additional aspects of the I/O subsystem, such as buffering and I/O bandwidth steering, are crucial because they significantly influence observed I/O costs.  This work provides accurate models to estimate I/O costs, considering the caching mechanisms of the operating system (OS) and the C standard library. These models improve the accuracy of HPC and workflow simulation frameworks for I/O-intensive applications.\n\nFollowing an overview of available Linux and C standard library I/O methods (Section 2) and a summary of the Linux page cache mechanism (Section 3), we present our primary contributions:\n\n* We define models for accurate I/O cost (write performance) prediction in scenarios with and without page caching and the C standard library buffer (Section 4).  We distinguish between:\n    * Synchronized, direct I/O with system calls (Section 4.2)\n    * Synchronized, non-direct I/O with system calls (Section 4.3)\n    * Non-synchronized I/O with system calls (Section 4.4)\n    * Standard library I/O (Section 4.5)\n\n* We discuss related work on I/O modeling and storage devices (Section 5).\n\n* We evaluate the accuracy of I/O cost predictions across various scenarios, hosts, and I/O devices, comparing them to measured system performance (Section 6).  Specifically:\n    * We compare CAWL estimations (our contribution) with SimGrid I/O estimates and demonstrate the importance of considering caching effects. We observe that the SimGrid I/O model overestimates I/O costs by up to 350% and underestimates them by up to 99% in different scenarios."}

The image sparked widespread speculation about alien artifacts, with many convinced it depicted an alien visage.  However, even if there were a civilization on Mars, NASA's exploration would be focused on scientific discovery.\n\nThe reality is far less sensational.  Studies have shown that the object is simply a butte or mesa, landforms common in the American West.  The resemblance to a human head is an illusion caused by a combination of rock formations and shadows, creating the impression of eyes, nose, and mouth.\n\nThis conclusion is supported by higher resolution images taken in 2001. The 2001 image boasts a resolution of 1.56 meters per pixel, a significant improvement over the 43 meters per pixel resolution of the 1976 Viking photo.  This increased clarity allows for much greater detail.

I squeezed my eyes shut, humming, trying to block him out, but the words still slipped through, insidious drips and drabs: \"Remember.... You are.... The Corsair....

Perhaps a roving travel writer?  But then I remembered Everest.\n\nI turned the corner of my road, slipping in the snow, suddenly feeling the effects of the low-oxygen atmosphere at the top of the world.  \"Not again,\" I muttered.

I couldn't remember the transition, how one had become the other.\n\nThe memory of the beach flowed back: I’d taken off my shoes, enjoying the warmth.  Houses in the distance, but a feeling pulled me in the opposite direction.  Further along the beach, I saw them: large, muscled men, their faces angry, loading heavy bags of white powder onto a boat. I’d waved, wanting to help, but never reached them. Dunes rose and fell, and suddenly, the beach was gone, replaced by the endless expanse of the desert.  A shame.  They might have helped.\n\nA soft idea began to bloom, unfurling like a flower – like the one I saw the last time I’d tried to get a haircut, only this time, no giant wasps. Not in my head. I walked, intentionally away from home, for hours, until thirst drove me to a market stall on a busy road.  I bartered for fruit juice, wandered through dusty pyramids and damp, empty temples, even through a round office filled with shouting men. I’d almost given up on… whatever my plan had been… when I finally found myself back home.\n\nNow, facing the bearded man and his insistent message, I knew I’d have to call my boss."}

{"text": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are demonstrating significant potential for autonomous operations, both indoors and outdoors.  While already utilized for transportation, industries are increasingly exploring their use in inspection, surveying, maintenance, and manipulation tasks within complex environments like power plants, pipelines, and high-rise buildings [1]-[9].  UAVs enhance human safety by removing personnel from hazardous situations and reducing manual effort.  Furthermore, investment is growing in their application as first responders in emergencies and for disaster mitigation, including evacuation support [10].  However, achieving autonomy in these critical applications presents challenges due to the potential lack of accurate positioning systems or a priori environmental knowledge [11].  Such missions often demand complex algorithms for exploration, mapping, state estimation, planning, control, and task allocation [12].  Executing these algorithms onboard increases payload and reduces flight time.  Offloading computationally intensive tasks to a remote system, while retaining minimal onboard control, offers a promising solution for improving performance and extending mission duration.\n\nFor UAV control, various methods offer unique advantages [13]-[17].  Model Predictive Control (MPC) [21] emerges as a strong candidate for executing desired tasks, such as trajectory tracking based on a high-level planner, while incorporating constraints on states [18],[19] and control inputs [20] for safety and optimal power usage.  Offloading MPC significantly reduces computational latency, enhancing performance [22].\n\nHowever, remote control introduces latency challenges.  Edge computing addresses this by bringing computational resources closer to the data source, enabling real-time processing of complex algorithms with reduced latency [23].  5G networking further accelerates edge-based control loops, offering high reliability and low communication delays [24], making these systems attractive for safety-critical remote operations.  Applications range from traffic management and healthcare to autonomous vehicles and smart homes [25]-[29].  Deploying modules within independent containers, often orchestrated using Kubernetes (K8s), enhances security, abstraction, and resource sharing [30]."}
{"text": "Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are targeted and sustained attacks carried out by sophisticated, well-resourced adversaries [1]. Characterized by a high degree of stealth, these threats can persist for extended periods, leading to disruptions and other severe consequences.  Preventing APTs entirely is difficult, as skilled attackers can bypass existing defenses by exploiting technical advantages like zero-day vulnerabilities [2].  Therefore, research into APT attribution is crucial for improving the deterrent effect of security defenses [3, 4, 5, 6].\n\nAPT attribution is a challenging task. Attackers frequently employ strategies to obfuscate their activities and even mislead attribution efforts [7]. Defenders must investigate Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and assess Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs, also known as high-level IOCs) within massive datasets.  They must also analyze attacker traits and diligently work to confirm their identities.  Early studies proposed several APT attribution models based on practical experience [3, 4, 8-12], implementing attribution analysis and inspiring subsequent technical research. Based on the analysis goals, APT attribution can be divided into two stages: attack process attribution using attack traces and threat actor attribution using attack features [4, 9].\n\nTechnical approaches for APT attribution include rule-based reasoning and machine learning methods. Rule-based reasoning encompasses argument-based reasoning [13-17] and graph rule-based reasoning [18-20]. These methods require experts to manually design numerous rules, and most of these rules focus on attack process attribution rather than threat actor attribution.  Researchers have recently developed machine learning-based APT attribution methods for both attack process attribution [21-26] and threat actor attribution [27-41].  Threat actor attribution methods can be further categorized into malware-based and Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)-based methods. Malware, a key component of APTs, often has various functions, such as command and control, and is essential for attribution. However, malware can be reused by different APT groups, limiting its effectiveness for threat actor attribution on its own.\n\nCTI reports on APTs aggregate characteristic and analytical information related to APT groups, including malicious Internet Protocols (IPs) or domains used for command and control, as well as the TTPs employed. Cybersecurity experts compile these reports based on the collection and analysis of multi-source data, including network traffic, malware, and open-source intelligence. Compared to malware, CTI offers richer contextual information and more diverse attribution data. Consequently, APT reports are a crucial data source for attribution analysis [42-45].\n\nAPT actor attribution based on CTI has garnered considerable research interest. Existing methods typically extract various features from CTI reports and input them into traditional machine learning models like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) to classify CTI reports according to their threat actors. These features can be categorized into three types: (1) Tactic and technique features [35-37] extracted using one-hot encoding [35, 36] or Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) [37] based on the ATT&CK framework. However, the expressivity of one-hot encoding or TF-IDF is limited, and the data diversity is restricted by focusing solely on tactic and technique features."}
{"text": "Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology can analyze facial expressions to determine emotions like happiness or sadness.  The article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" suggests that this technology could allow a computer to detect student confusion or boredom and adjust lessons accordingly. While potentially valuable in certain situations, widespread classroom application is unlikely to be effective.\n\nThe primary challenge lies in the diversity of student emotions within a classroom.  Students react differently to the same material.  For instance, in a math class, some students might find the concepts engaging while others are uninterested.\n\nWhile individualized instruction, as mentioned in paragraph 6, might benefit a single student, adapting a lesson for a class of 30-50 based on the emotions of a few would be impractical and unfair to those engaged with the current lesson plan.  Teaching different lessons simultaneously to different groups within the same class would be logistically challenging and place undue strain on teachers.\n\nA more effective application of FACS in the classroom would be to focus on identifying student confusion rather than boredom.  A bored student is unlikely to become engaged through a simple conversation, whereas a confused student could benefit from individualized attention and clarification.  A teacher's primary concern should be student comprehension and academic progress.\n\nFACS is a powerful tool with significant potential for understanding human behavior.  However, its effectiveness in a group learning environment is limited. While FACS can accurately read individual emotions, applying those readings to modify whole-class instruction is impractical.  It's much more effective for one-on-one assessment of student understanding.  Addressing individual confusion is a viable strategy.  As paragraph 9 humorously suggests, forcing a smile won't solve the underlying issue of student dissatisfaction with a lesson."}

Lors d'une conférence TED à Vancouver le 16 avril, il a expliqué, selon Quartz, que ces éléments pervertissent l'usage de la plateforme.\n\nCes options, selon lui, n'encouragent pas des échanges constructifs. « Si je devais tout recommencer, je ne mettrais pas autant l'accent sur le nombre d'abonnés, ni sur le nombre de \"J'aime\".

{"text": "Large language models (LLMs) possess impressive text generation capabilities thanks to large-scale pre-training on real-world data (Brown et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2021).  However, this process also leads to the absorption of toxic content, including social biases (Sheng et al., 2019; Wallace et al., 2019a).  This toxicity poses a significant obstacle to the safe deployment and commercialization of LLMs in applications like AI assistants (Dinan et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022a).  Consequently, numerous studies have focused on detecting and mitigating toxicity in LLMs (Blodgett et al., 2020; Ganguli et al., 2022).\n\nThese studies typically rely on datasets designed for specific types of toxicity, such as social bias (Sap et al., 2020; Nangia et al., 2020) or hate speech (Warner and Hirschberg, 2012; Lee et al., 2022).  These datasets are not only task-specific, but also language- and culture-specific.  For example, hate speech manifests differently in South Korea compared to the United States.  Beyond language differences, the targeted demographic groups also vary.  In South Korea, common targets include feminists and Korean Chinese, while in the United States, African Americans and Jewish people are frequently targeted (Jeong et al., 2022).  Existing Korean toxicity datasets primarily focus on explicit hate speech and cover a limited number of demographic groups (Moon et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2022; Kang et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2022).  This limitation highlights the need for a dataset addressing social biases against a more comprehensive range of demographic groups in South Korea.\n\nTo address this gap, we introduce the Korean Social Bias (KOSBI) dataset, a large-scale dataset comprising 34,000 pairs of contexts and sentences in Korean, labeled primarily for the presence of social biases.<sup>1</sup>  It encompasses 72 targeted demographic groups across 15 categories,<sup>2</sup> a significantly broader scope than existing datasets (see Table 2).  These categories include common ones like gender and religion, as well as those particularly relevant to South Korea, such as marital status and domestic area of origin—groups frequently subject to social bias within the country.  Due to the difficulty of collecting sufficient data for each of the 72 demographic groups from the web, we utilized HyperCLOVA (Kim et al., 2021) to generate data with in-context few-shot learning.\n\n<sup>1</sup> The KOSBI dataset, with English-translated annotations, is available at https://github.com/naver-ai/korean-safety-benchmarks for non-Korean speakers.\n\n<sup>2</sup> Categories and demographic groups were selected based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and guidelines from the National Human Rights Commission of Korea (NHRCK)."}

This technology, which interprets emotions through facial muscle movement, offers the education system a powerful way to connect with students and support their emotional engagement with lectures and assignments, providing a valuable aid to their learning.\n\nWhile humans can infer the feelings of others by observing their faces, these interpretations are subjective and often inaccurate.

A computer equipped with FACS can recognize a student's needs during online learning.  As Dr. Huang explains, \"a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, [allowing the computer] to modify the lesson.\" This ability to recognize emotions through facial movement can improve student performance by tailoring lessons to their individual needs, addressing the challenges faced by students who struggle to focus when lessons are boring or difficult to understand. Technologies like FACS provide an adaptive and responsive system that enhances focus and facilitates more effective learning.\n\nSome may argue that technologies like FACS invade privacy or are unreliable in their emotional assessments. However, these technologies simply replicate what millions of people do every day: read facial expressions. FACS reads and recognizes facial movements to determine emotion, just as we do when trying to understand the feelings of those around us. These technologies employ a complex level of facial recognition developed and tested by professionals like Dr. Huang and Dr. Paul Ekman, who studied anatomical movements and structures to classify six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."}

My old bones aren't exactly loving it, but if we're going to make it to Christmas, we have to brave the cold weather.\n\nI've got some more funny tales to tell you.  Old Earl and his friend Bubba Ray went fishing the other morning, and they came back with a whopper of a fish tale. This is how it went (according to Earl, mind you, because Bubba Ray is famous for telling some whoppers).  Anyhow, Bubba Ray and Earl were fishing and having some pretty good luck, except after a while they ran out of worms. Then, Bubba Ray saw a cottonmouth with its lips wrapped around a big old toad frog.  Well, Bubba Ray said, \"Hey Earl, did you know that frogs are good bass bait?\" He pointed at the one hanging out of the snake's mouth and said, \"What do you think?\"\n\nWell, Earl said he knew the snake couldn't bite them with that frog in its mouth, so he grabbed it right behind the head, stole the frog right out of its mouth, and put it in Bubba Ray's bait bucket. After that, they were faced with the dilemma of how to turn loose of that snake without getting bitten.  Well, Bubba Ray fetched his bottle of whiskey, which he always has within arm's reach, and poured a little bit right in that snake's mouth. The snake's eyes rolled back in its head, and it went limp. After that, Earl knew he could let it go, so he dropped it into the lake. Bubba Ray went back to fishing using the frog they'd just confiscated, but in a few minutes, he felt a nudge on his bare foot. When he looked down, it was that same snake with two more frogs in its mouth. Now ain't that a knee-slapper?"}

{"text": "Sally’s volcano project initially struck me as utterly unoriginal. Volcanoes, along with ant farms and sea monkeys, were the epitome of clichéd science fair entries.  We had, in fact, lifted a decade-long ban on these projects only the previous year, hoping to encourage more imaginative endeavors after years of textbook regurgitations. So, seeing Sally, a straight-A honor roll student known for her reserved demeanor, present a volcano, felt like a letdown.  I assumed she’d simply run out of time and resorted to a last-minute, predictable project.  Especially considering her proclaimed passion for archaeology, I rationalized that science might not be her forte.\n\nBut there was something about her impish grin, so unlike her usual self, that hinted at something more.\n\nThe volcano itself appeared standard at first glance:  paper mache, roughly the size of an overturned bucket, likely spray-painted.  A towel at the base suggested the typical baking soda and vinegar eruption. Accompanying diagrams of shield, cinder, and composite volcanoes looked copied straight from a textbook.  The predictable bottle of vinegar sat ready. I braced myself for the usual 30-second fizz and tried to anticipate what color she might have dyed the baking soda.\n\n\"Welcome to the world of volcanoes!\" she began, her presentation catching my attention.\n\n\"For eons, man has gazed at these pits of glowing magma with bewilderment! What secret gods and demons dwell within? How can we be safe? And what actions can shield us from the horrors of the earth?\"  Her dramatic opening, at least, was unexpected.\n\n\"We will delve into this question, but first, we will need some volunteers!\"  Confused, I looked around. I was the only judge at her table.\n\nThen, with a flourish, she lifted the towel.  \"Behold! The mighty ant colony of Pompeii the Second!\"\n\nBeneath the volcano lay a meticulously crafted Grecian city, teeming with large carpenter ants.  There was no underground nest, only the intricate, above-ground structures.  Beside the city, visible from the front, a fish tank filled with sea monkeys served as an ocean.\n\n\"Ah! There they are! The citizens of my ant-topia. They worship this mountain every day, not realizing that a shifting of tectonic plates is about to seal their doom!\" She revealed a detailed cutaway of the volcano's underlying tectonic plates, complete with labeled fault lines. Below that, a metal box with a button and tubes connected to a pressurized tank.\n\nAs I marveled at the geological detail, I noticed the tubes. This was no ordinary vinegar and baking soda volcano.\n\n\"Will a sacrifice to the gods appease the mighty volcanoes wrath?\" She plucked an ant from the city and dropped it into the cone with a chilling cackle. \"No!\"\n\nShe pressed the button.  The plates separated, and hot steam erupted from the volcano’s peak, drawing a crowd.  \"Nature produces some terrifying monsters, and not out of wrath. Know that the very orb you are standing upon supports life by a tiny layer! All else is lava and heat!\"\n\nMolten silver, not baking soda and vinegar, flowed from the volcano, burning through the paper mache.  \"I must warn you not to touch the lava! It is quite hot!… I assure you all, that we are all quite safe. But, I can make no such assurances for the inhabitants below.”\n\nAs the silver lava flowed through pre-made channels, incinerating the ant city, Sally narrated the ants’ final moments, their daily routines interrupted by fiery destruction. A child in the growing crowd cried out, claiming to hear the ants scream.  The hissing and popping did sound eerily like tiny screams.\n\nThen, black tar-like substance followed the silver flow.  \"The metal will cool in mere moments, but let us now witness the passage of time,\" she explained, as the black flow solidified, burying Pompeii the Second.\n\nShe described how the lava created an oxygen-deficient dead zone in the ocean, killing the sea monkeys.  \"One day, archaeologists will uncover the secrets of Pompeii the Second… Science,\" she concluded, \"answers the question of How. And archaeologists answer the question of why it once mattered so greatly to us.”  She then provided tiny shovels and brushes for the audience to excavate the scene.\n\nHow could I not award her first place? It was a breathtaking, albeit disturbing, presentation.  But Sally’s smile, the chilling detachment with which she orchestrated the destruction of her miniature world, haunts me still. It feels like a message, a glimpse into something fiery hidden beneath her calm exterior. Perhaps I’ve been overly sensitized by those lectures on violence prevention, but I can’t shake the feeling that there’s something more to Sally than meets the eye."}

Esta petición generó división entre los socios del Gobierno: Geroa Bai, Podemos e Izquierda-Ezkerra votaron a favor de la propuesta de EH Bildu, mientras que el PSN se abstuvo, argumentando la falta de garantías para la ejecución de dichas inversiones. Navarra Suma también se abstuvo, atribuyendo al anterior Gobierno de Uxue Barkos la problemática actual con los plazos.\n\nEl Parlamento instó al Gobierno foral a elaborar, en el plazo de un mes, un proyecto de ley foral para un crédito extraordinario de 25 millones de euros en los Presupuestos Generales de Navarra de 2019.  Este crédito se destinaría a inversiones financieramente sostenibles, contempladas en la ley foral de octubre de 2018 y aún no ejecutadas.  La iniciativa de EH Bildu recibió el apoyo de Geroa Bai, Podemos e Izquierda-Ezkerra, con la abstención de Navarra Suma y el PSN. La moción propone financiar este crédito extraordinario con el remanente de tesorería para gastos generales, correspondiente al superávit de 2018.\n\nAdolfo Araiz (EH Bildu) afirmó que Navarra cumplía todos los requisitos de la disposición adicional de los Presupuestos Generales de 2018 para realizar estas inversiones: superávit, cumplimiento de la regla de gasto y del objetivo de deuda pública, además del periodo medio de pago.  \"No hay excusas. El Gobierno de Navarra tiene la posibilidad de destinar 25 millones a estas inversiones\", señaló.\n\nJuan Luis Sánchez de Muniáin (Navarra Suma) se mostró a favor de tramitar suplementos de crédito para inversiones, pero en contra de \"engañar a los ayuntamientos con promesas de inversiones irrealizables por la desidia en la gestión de los caudales públicos\".  Criticó la ley de octubre de 2018, alegando que, al aprobarse, ya se conocía el incumplimiento de la regla de gasto por parte del Gobierno de Navarra, lo que requería la autorización del Ministerio de Hacienda, haciendo inviables las inversiones.\n\nJorge Aguirre (PSN) explicó que su grupo siempre apoyaría inversiones beneficiosas para la ciudadanía, pero que no podían generar expectativas sobre algo que no se podía asegurar.  \"Generaríamos más frustración que certezas. Los plazos impedirían finalizar los expedientes antes de fin de año, sometiendo a las administraciones a un procedimiento apresurado y problemático\", indicó.\n\nEn la misma línea, Pablo Azcona (Geroa Bai) señaló la dificultad, incluso la imposibilidad, de cumplir los plazos, considerando la redacción de la ley, la tramitación parlamentaria, los órganos perceptivos y la nueva ley de contratos.  No obstante, compartía el objetivo de las inversiones y ofreció negociar su inclusión en los Presupuestos Generales de Navarra para 2020.\n\nMikel Buil (Podemos) defendió la ejecución de las inversiones y respaldó la iniciativa de EH Bildu, criticando la aplicación de la ley de estabilidad presupuestaria, \"una ley austericida que impide recuperar los servicios públicos\"."}
{"text": "The rapid growth of medical digitalization has led to an explosion of medical documentation, including electronic medical records, reports, and other formats.  Extracting information from this data, particularly through medical named entity recognition (NER), is increasingly crucial for applications like knowledge graph construction, question-answering systems, and automated analysis of electronic medical records. Medical NER aims to automatically identify medical entities within text. These entities include, but are not limited to, body (bod), disease (dis), clinical symptom (sym), medical procedure (pro), medical equipment (equ), drug (dru), and medical examination item (ite).\n\nThese entities often exhibit complex characteristics, such as lengthy spans, nested structures, and polysemy, posing significant challenges for medical NER. For example, as shown in Figure 1, the three \"bod\" entities \"迷走神经\" (vagus nerve), \"舌咽神经核\" (glossopharyngeal nucleus), and \"舌下神经核\" (hypoglossal nucleus) are nested within the \"sym\" entity \"迷走神经、舌咽神经核及舌下神经核受损 伤\" (injury of vagus nerve, glossopharyngeal nucleus, and hypoglossal nucleus).\n\nTo address the challenge of nested NER, we adopt a machine reading comprehension (MRC) approach, similar to the strategies employed by Li et al. (2020b) and Du et al. (2022).  Following Li et al. (2022), we leverage a joint prediction method that combines the strengths of Biaffine and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) predictors. Furthermore, we introduce a task-adaptive pre-training strategy to fine-tune the pre-trained model specifically for the medical domain. Our model incorporates several performance-enhancing techniques, including Conditional Layer Normalization (CLN), weighted layer fusion, word-pair embeddings, and multi-granularity dilated convolution.\n\nIn summary, this paper makes the following contributions:\n\n* We propose a novel nested medical NER model based on MRC, integrating Biaffine and MLP for joint prediction."}

Globally, India ranks 23rd, with women holding only 15.2 percent of board seats, significantly below the global average of 20.6 percent.  This contrasts sharply with global leaders France (44.4 percent), Norway (40.9 percent), and Belgium (35.9 percent).\n\nWhile APAC (excluding Japan) has seen a slight increase in boardroom diversity, rising from 11.6 percent in 2015 to 14.4 percent in 2019, the regional disparity is vast.  Representation ranges from a low of 3.1 percent in South Korea to nearly 30 percent in Vietnam and Australia/New Zealand.  South Korea (3.1 percent), Pakistan (5.5 percent), and Japan (5.7 percent) hold the bottom three positions globally.  Malaysia, France, Australia, Germany, and Austria have shown the most significant improvement over the past five years, with increases between 9.4 and 12.8 percentage points.\n\nIndia’s representation in senior management also saw marginal improvement, rising from 6.9 percent in 2016 to 8.5 percent in 2019.  However, this still places India third-lowest in APAC, ahead of only South Korea (4 percent) and Japan (3 percent).  The global picture shows the US (21 percent) and APAC (19 percent) with greater management diversity than Europe (17 percent), despite Europe's focus on boardroom quotas.  Growth in the US and APAC appears to be more organic.\n\nFurthermore, India holds the third-lowest spot in APAC for women CEOs (2 percent) and the second-lowest for women CFOs (1 percent).  Globally, Singapore and Italy lead in women CEO representation at 15 percent, followed by Thailand (9 percent) and the Philippines (8 percent).

{"text": "Driverless cars present significant challenges that make their widespread development for public use questionable.  These challenges center around exorbitant costs, questionable utility, and serious safety concerns.\n\nThe financial burden of developing truly driverless cars is staggering.  Equipping vehicles with the necessary sensors and cameras is just the beginning.  As some sources acknowledge, creating the infrastructure to support these vehicles, such as electrifying or magnetizing roads, is prohibitively expensive.  These vast sums could be better allocated to addressing pressing social needs rather than pursuing technological novelty.\n\nFurthermore, the concept of partially automated vehicles raises concerns about their actual usefulness.  While these cars might handle driving under normal conditions, they would still require driver intervention in complex situations like work zones or accidents.  If a driver must remain vigilant and ready to take control, the value proposition of a \"self-driving\" car diminishes significantly.  Proposed additions like in-car entertainment systems further exacerbate this issue, potentially distracting drivers and hindering their ability to react swiftly to emergencies.\n\nThis leads to the most critical concern: safety.  Proponents argue that driverless cars will improve public transport and fuel efficiency.  However, these potential benefits are overshadowed by the inherent risks.  In a fully autonomous vehicle, passengers would be helpless in the face of an unavoidable accident.  Even in partially automated cars, the presence of entertainment systems could delay driver reaction times, increasing the likelihood of accidents.\n\nIn conclusion, the pursuit of driverless technology faces substantial obstacles. The immense financial investment required, coupled with the questionable practicality of partially automated systems and the overriding safety concerns, makes the large-scale development of driverless cars for public use a dubious endeavor."}
{"text": "El transporte público de pasajeros en San Francisco enfrenta un futuro incierto tras la decisión de la Municipalidad de no renovar el contrato con Autobuses Santa Fe, vencido el 16 de mayo.  La pandemia, la cuarentena y la inactividad del servicio influyeron en la determinación del intendente Ignacio García Aresca, quien por el momento descarta una nueva licitación.\n\nLos colectivos, ausentes desde el inicio de la pandemia, podrían no regresar.  El Gobierno local evalúa un sistema reducido, con unidades más pequeñas para preservar el deteriorado estado de las calles, en caso de retomar el servicio.  Este cambio se consideraría teniendo en cuenta que los principales usuarios eran estudiantes, seguidos por trabajadores y un grupo de adultos mayores.\n\nEn 2019, el servicio mostraba un crecimiento en su uso, con 1.800 boletos diarios, casi 800 más que en 2018.  Además, se mantenía una alta demanda de boletos gratuitos: 600 estudiantes con el Boleto Educativo Gratuito (BEG) y 130 jubilados con el Boleto del Adulto Mayor (BAM), representando casi la mitad de los usuarios.\n\nEl municipio analiza la optimización del horario y la frecuencia, que era de 35 minutos.  Se busca acotar el horario de funcionamiento y la cantidad de unidades, reforzando las horas pico de entrada y salida del trabajo y las escuelas, dado que en muchos momentos las unidades circulan prácticamente vacías.\n\nEl secretario de Gobierno, Damián Bernarte, confirmó que se evalúan diferentes posibilidades: una nueva licitación similar a la anterior, una modalidad diferente de prestación del servicio, alternativas para la circulación dentro de la ciudad, o incluso la suspensión definitiva del servicio por un tiempo.  La decisión dependerá de la evolución de la pandemia y la continuidad de la cuarentena.\n\nLa no renovación del contrato representa un ahorro mensual de más de 700 mil pesos para el municipio, que se sumaba al aporte provincial y nacional para la operatividad del servicio.  La abrupta quita de subsidios nacionales en 2019 obligó al municipio a asumir una parte importante del financiamiento, complementado por el Programa Provincial de Asistencia al Transporte Público de Pasajeros.\n\nBernarte explicó que se trabajaba en nuevos pliegos para una licitación en marzo, pero la pandemia modificó los planes.  La emergencia económica y la baja recaudación, sumadas a la suspensión preventiva del servicio antes de la cuarentena, llevaron a la decisión de no prorrogar el contrato ni llamar a licitación.\n\nLa municipalización del servicio es otra opción en estudio, aunque implicaría asumir responsabilidades como el mantenimiento de las unidades y la siniestralidad.  El Gobierno local cree factible sostener el servicio con la inversión actual y el apoyo provincial. La decisión final aún está pendiente.  Mientras tanto, el municipio considera alternativas como la promoción del uso de ciclovías para una movilidad segura y saludable."}

La jeune Suédoise répond point par point :\n\n**Sur ses motivations :**\n\n« Beaucoup propagent des rumeurs, prétendant que je suis manipulée, payée ou utilisée.  Or, je n’agis que par conviction personnelle.  Mes parents, loin d’être des militants écologistes, ont été sensibilisés à la cause par mon engagement. Je n’appartiens à aucune organisation.  Je collabore ponctuellement avec des ONG œuvrant pour le climat et l’environnement, mais je reste totalement indépendante.  Mon action est entièrement bénévole. Je n’ai reçu aucune rémunération, ni promesse de paiement, ni moi ni ma famille.  Et cela ne changera pas.  D’ailleurs, je n’ai jamais rencontré un seul militant climatique luttant pour l’argent.  Cette idée est absurde.  Enfin, je voyage uniquement avec l’autorisation de mon école, et mes parents prennent en charge les frais de transport et d’hébergement. »\n\n**Sur son âge et son autisme :**\n\n« Certains se moquent de ma différence.  Mais le syndrome d’Asperger n’est pas une maladie, c’est une force. On dit aussi que mon autisme m’empêche d’agir de ma propre initiative.  C’est pourtant la raison même de mon engagement. Si j’étais “normale” et sociable, j’aurais rejoint ou créé une association.  Mais mon manque de sociabilité m’a poussée vers la grève scolaire.  Frustrée par l’inaction face à l’urgence climatique, je me devais d’agir.  Parfois, l’inaction – comme s’asseoir devant le Parlement et sécher les cours – est plus éloquente que l’action.  Un murmure peut être plus puissant qu’un cri. On me reproche aussi de “parler et écrire comme une adulte”.  Une adolescente de 16 ans n’aurait-elle pas le droit de s’exprimer ?  On me critique enfin de simplifier les choses.  Par exemple, quand j’affirme que “la crise climatique est simple : c’est tout noir ou tout blanc”, “nous devons stopper les émissions de gaz à effet de serre” ou “je veux que vous paniquiez”.

{"text": "Over the past century, technology has undeniably advanced, and its progress continues.  This advancement has made driverless cars a present-day possibility, thanks to the ingenuity of car manufacturers.  This wave of innovation promises to revolutionize transportation, offering substantial benefits for humanity.\n\nDriverless cars represent not just the future, but a highly effective solution for safer roads.  Their advanced safety features promise to significantly reduce collisions and accidents.  Unlike human drivers, autonomous vehicles adhere strictly to safety protocols, benefiting not only their occupants but also everyone else on the road.  Reckless driving, a major cause of accidents, would be virtually eliminated.\n\nThe potential for accident reduction is immense.  Driverless cars eliminate the risks associated with impaired driving, texting while driving, and driver fatigue.  Consider the danger posed by an intoxicated driver.  An autonomous vehicle removes this danger entirely.  Similarly, the risks of texting and driving, and falling asleep at the wheel, are mitigated by the technology and sensors of driverless cars, leading to a substantial decrease in accidents and fatalities.\n\nIn large cities, driverless cars offer advantages over traditional taxis and buses.  Environmentally, they are projected to consume half the fuel of current taxis, addressing growing concerns about air pollution.  Their flexibility and efficiency could also transform public transportation.  With a fleet of driverless vehicles, public transit could become significantly faster and more fluid.\n\nUnlike taxis with fixed schedules and fares, driverless public transportation would be available on demand and free of charge, as there would be no driver to pay.  This could revolutionize city life and potentially reshape our world.\n\nWith the potential to save lives and protect the environment, driverless cars possess numerous positive attributes.  They promise a safer, cleaner, and more efficient future for all.  Undoubtedly, driverless cars are the way forward, enhancing the well-being of the human population."}

Everyone knew the score.\n\n\"Signal out here is fucking awful, right?\" the other thug said as I dumped the kid on the ground beside the unmarked grave.\n\nI checked my phone. No bars. \"Agreed,\" I grunted, cutting the conversation short. These things never lasted long.\n\n\"Take off the bag and the duct tape for the picture. I gotta take a quick piss,\" I told the thug. He nodded. I ducked behind the truck, eager to finish up and get back to town, maybe find a cheap hooker.\n\nWhen I returned, the bag and tape were gone. The kid was staring at the ground, his… oddly familiar brown hair… No, I was just tired. Time to get this over with.\n\n\"Look up to the camera,\" I ordered, pulling out my phone.\n\n\"Tommy… Tommy?

{"text": "A driverless car offers significant benefits, especially for long-distance travel.  For those who can't afford to fly, it provides a comfortable alternative to enduring long hours behind the wheel.  While occasional stops for fuel would still be necessary, the overall experience would be far more relaxing.\n\nImagine traveling to California or Florida, simply reclining your seat and enjoying the journey.  Some models might even feature integrated televisions in the dashboard, allowing passengers to watch movies or shows.  This eliminates the fatigue and distractions associated with traditional driving, such as drowsiness or cell phone use.  If needed, the system could automatically disable the entertainment system, reposition the seat, and alert the driver to take control.  Advanced sensors would detect potential hazards far ahead, providing ample time to react.\n\nLuxury car manufacturers like Cadillac or Audi could further enhance the experience by designing opulent and comfortable interiors. This could make long-distance travel by car more appealing than dealing with airport security lines and the hassles of flying. Of course, ensuring passenger safety in the event of an accident would be paramount.\n\nThe risk of falling asleep at the wheel is a serious concern, and driverless technology offers a potential solution.

Los ensayos se llevarán a cabo en los hospitales La Paz y La Princesa de Madrid, y Marqués de Valdecilla de Santander, tal y como anunció el Gobierno el pasado 28 de agosto, tras la autorización de la Agencia Española de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios (AEMPS). Durante los últimos quince días, los responsables se han dedicado a reclutar y seleccionar a los voluntarios idóneos.  Mientras tanto, la noticia de la interrupción temporal de los ensayos de la prometedora vacuna de la Universidad de Oxford, debido a una posible reacción adversa en una voluntaria, ha generado inquietud a nivel mundial, incluyendo España.  Según algunos responsables de las pruebas, esta noticia ha incrementado las dudas en algunos potenciales voluntarios, especialmente entre los de mayor edad.\n\nLa fase II de la vacuna de Janssen, denominada Ad26.COV2.S,  se está probando también en Alemania y Países Bajos. En España, requiere un total de 190 participantes: 75 en cada uno de los dos centros madrileños y 40 en el cántabro.  Esta vacuna se presenta como una alternativa si la de AstraZeneca (el laboratorio que trabaja con Oxford) finalmente no prospera.  De hecho, es una de las cinco vacunas para las que la Unión Europea ha firmado un preacuerdo de compra, aunque las negociaciones para concretarla continúan.  Los responsables esperan concluir esta fase en aproximadamente catorce meses, si bien los resultados estarán disponibles en unos cinco. Paralelamente, se prevé el inicio de la fase III. Una portavoz de Johnson & Johnson ha aclarado que actualmente \"no disponen de plazos fijos\", ya que el desarrollo depende de la evolución de la fase en cada centro.  Además, advierte que \"el proceso puede interrumpirse y retomarse en varias ocasiones, por ejemplo, si algún voluntario contrae una gripe u otra afección que requiera análisis\".  Precisamente, esto es lo que ha ocurrido en Oxford.\n\nEn España, las edades de los participantes se han dividido en dos franjas: de 18 a 55 años y mayores de 65. Las vacunaciones comenzaron el lunes en el Marqués de Valdecilla, y el martes en La Paz y La Princesa. El investigador Alberto Borobia, coordinador de la operación en La Paz, explica que no ha habido problemas para reclutar voluntarios jóvenes. Solo en su hospital recibieron alrededor de 200 candidaturas para las 50 plazas necesarias, y cuentan con una reserva de 40 personas en caso de que alguna falle.  Sin embargo, \"una vez que se empieza a vacunar, el número de participantes queda fijado\".\n\nEn cuanto al grupo de mayores de 65 años, aún están pendientes de completar las 25 plazas previstas.  Tienen confirmados a algo más de la mitad y continuarán recabando consentimientos hasta el fin de semana.  Esto se debe a que \"muchos candidatos no cumplían los criterios de inclusión y otros se han retirado\". El primer criterio de inclusión, para todos los participantes, es no haber pasado ni estar pasando la infección por SARS-CoV-2.  Por ello, se realizan PCR y test serológicos hasta esta misma semana, ya que \"deben hacerse justo antes o pierden validez\"."}

La phase 1b porterait cette réserve à 1.000 lits, soit la moitié de la capacité totale,  une charge considérable pour de nombreux hôpitaux.  De plus, la capacité réelle est inférieure à la capacité théorique de 2.000 lits, en raison de l'absentéisme croissant du personnel soignant (maladie, quarantaine).  « Plusieurs hôpitaux signalent des fermetures de lits par manque de personnel, tant en soins intensifs que dans d'autres services », a alerté Steven Van Gucht.\n\nL'évolution de la situation reste difficile à prévoir."}

{"text": "Measuring the relatedness between two words is a common task.  Automated approaches generally fall into three categories [22]: corpus-based methods, knowledge-based methods, and hybrid methods. Corpus-based methods leverage large text corpora and analyze word co-occurrence, as exemplified in [47].  Knowledge-based methods rely on structured resources like knowledge graphs or ontologies, such as in [13]. Hybrid methods combine these approaches, as seen in [38].  Due to the abundance of textual data and advancements in natural language processing, corpus-based methods have been extensively studied. Knowledge-based methods, the focus of this paper, depend on the availability and quality of a knowledge base. These methods require mapping words to knowledge base resources, bridging the gap between linguistic and knowledge-based representations.\n\nOntologies have become prominent knowledge representation tools, particularly for advanced reasoning, since the rise of the Semantic Web.  However, they have limitations: (i) creation and maintenance are often manual and costly; (ii) general-purpose ontologies, like WordNet, primarily contain hierarchical relations ( *is a* and *part of*) and offer limited relation types.  Note that similarity, a key concept in clustering [6], is also fundamental. Clustering, which partitions data into similar groups, has been widely studied, for instance, in ontology matching [10] to handle large-scale ontologies by decomposing instances into smaller clusters. Clustering in semantic spaces is also used for tasks like image collection summarization and self-supervision [54].  Resim (Resource Similarity), a measure for evaluating semantic similarity of DBpedia resources, was introduced, and subsequently, a more general relatedness approach was proposed in [44], which is one of the ten methods examined in this work (see Sections 5.2 and A.2.2).\n\nThis paper specifically addresses semantic relatedness, rather than the narrower concept of semantic similarity.  Domain-specific semantic relatedness measures and datasets (e.g., biomedicine [31]) are excluded because their effectiveness often doesn't generalize well [22].\n\nThe analyzed approaches are categorized into three groups based on their reliance on WordNet, Wikipedia, and Machine Learning, respectively.  Two recent methods, [39] and [2], deserve mention.  The former proposes a cross-domain item closeness measure for recommender systems based on co-occurrence counts of item-describing words on web pages. The latter evaluates semantic relatedness in unstructured data using fuzzy vectors and various relatedness techniques.  However, neither is knowledge-based and thus are excluded from our experiment.\n\n**WordNet:**  WordNet, a relatively simple knowledge graph modeling the English lexicon, primarily contains taxonomic (*is a*) and meronymic (*part of*) relations, with fewer thematic relations (see the next section on semantic relations). Several WordNet-based semantic relatedness approaches exist [57, 5, 33].  [57] addresses relatedness in labeled tree data using WordNet's hierarchical relations.  [5] introduces a method based on weighted paths defined by non-taxonomic relations, noting that most existing methods rely on *is a*.  [33] combines WordNet with word embedding for performance improvement.  [59] defines a random walk-based algorithm, but its evaluation is limited to WordNet. This paper excludes WordNet-specific approaches, focusing on methods applicable to larger, more relationally diverse knowledge graphs.\n\n**Wikipedia:**  Wikipedia, a vast online encyclopedia, can be viewed as a large corpus with entities described in natural language.  Extracting structured information requires substantial pre-processing.  The aforementioned WCG is a hybrid structure, not a strict *is a* taxonomy, designed for Wikipedia article management.  Research exploring the trade-off between natural language query expressivity and usability over Linked Data is valuable.  [20] presents the TREO system, combining entity search, TF-IDF [3], spreading activation, and WLM (analyzed in this work – see Sections 5.1 and A.1.1).  Similarly, [60] combines knowledge graphs and text similarity for complex question answering.  Wikipedia-focused approaches, often relying on corpus-based techniques and natural language processing beyond this work's scope, are excluded, except for WLM, analyzed in its RDF graph form.\n\n**Machine Learning:**  Recent work applies machine learning to semantic relatedness, encoding knowledge as numerical vectors (word embedding for text, graph embedding for graphs).  Examples of word embedding for semantic relatedness include [35, 52, 65].  [35] aims for better accuracy in various contexts. [52] represents keyphrases for similar news article retrieval. [65] constructs a relatedness graph for sentiment analysis. However, the first two are corpus-based, and the third is a hybrid approach, thus excluded from our experiment.  Regarding graph embedding, [50] proposes RDF2Vec using neural networks for Linked Data relatedness. This is arguably the first approach leveraging graph structure and neural language modeling for entity relatedness/similarity. However, computational cost remains a challenge [8], with experiments on even small datasets facing termination or memory issues.  Computational efficiency in this area is an open problem [7] beyond this paper's scope.  Finally, [26] applies machine learning to images representing words, investigating cognitive mechanisms using deep convolutional neural networks but doesn't involve graph-based knowledge, the focus of this work."}

These agents employ various learning techniques and data training to achieve specified goals. When these agents are represented computationally, they are referred to as computational agents [David L. Poole, 2010; Elaine Rich, 2010]. AI has revolutionized many aspects of our lives, thanks to cutting-edge research. However, this rapidly evolving field constantly demands new paradigms to create even more accurate and reliable AI systems.  AI encompasses a broad spectrum of research areas, including machine learning, data mining, intelligent tutoring, case-based reasoning, multi-agent planning, scheduling, uncertain reasoning, natural language understanding and translation, vision, virtual reality, games, robotics, and more [Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020; Nilsson, 2010; Goodrich and Schultz, 2007; Buczak and Guven, 2016; Bahrammirzaee, 2010; Bengio et al., 2013; Brougham and Haar, 2018; Corvalan, 2018; Ghahramani, 2015; Castelvecchi].\n\nCurrently, Machine Learning (ML) is a particularly active area of AI research.  ML focuses on developing intelligent systems through data training. A system model trained on a dataset can then make predictions about the nature of future data (test data). Common ML techniques include data understanding (normalization and processing), regression, clustering, classification, dimension reduction, deep learning, big data handling, and online learning [McDonald, 1989; Musumeci et al., 2019; Bishop, 2006; Chapelle et al., 2006; Collobert et al., 2011; Du et al.; Freund and Schapire, 1997; Grira et al., 2004; Guyon and Elisseeff, 2006; LeCun et al., 2015a; Pedregosa et al., 2011; Vapnik, 1998].

{"text": "The article, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" attempts to argue that exploring Venus is worthwhile despite the inherent risks. However, the author undermines their own argument by presenting a more compelling case *against* Venusian exploration.  The inclusion of numerous drawbacks ultimately weakens the author's thesis and damages their overall argument.\n\nRight from the outset, the author highlights the dangers of Venus, stating that \"no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours\" and that \"not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.\" These statements immediately create a negative impression, suggesting the extreme difficulty and potential futility of such an endeavor.  Instead of inspiring interest, the author evokes fear and apprehension by emphasizing the planet's hostility.  Phrases like \"thick atmosphere,\" \"corrosive sulfuric acid,\" \"800 degrees Fahrenheit,\" and \"extreme\" further solidify this image of Venus as an inhospitable and dangerous world.\n\nWhile the author asserts that \"Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit,\" this argument lacks substantial support. The author provides little evidence to demonstrate the benefits of exploring Venus, offering significantly less detail compared to the extensive description of its dangers.  Consequently, the potential downsides—death, wasted resources, and time—seem to far outweigh any potential advantages.\n\nThe author's focus on the perilous conditions of Venus ultimately overshadows any arguments in favor of exploration.  The unlivable environment and hazardous atmosphere presented by the author inadvertently demonstrate that Venus is likely too dangerous to explore at present.  This ultimately leads the reader to conclude that the author fails to effectively support their thesis due to a lack of compelling evidence and a preponderance of counter-arguments."}

{"text": "Quantum computation faces a key challenge: efficiently synthesizing short sequences of implementable quantum gates, or circuits, that realize a given unitary operation. This paper addresses this challenge for Clifford circuits, a subset of unitary transformations crucial in diverse areas such as quantum error correction, state distillation, randomized benchmarking, entanglement studies, and shadow tomography [2, 5, 6, 16, 20, 21, 23, 25].  Clifford circuits are not only important components of physical-level and fault-tolerant quantum circuits but can also constitute entire algorithms, like the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm and its generalizations [9, 25].\n\nThe Clifford group's significance stems from its property of being a unitary 2-design [11, 12]. This means random Clifford elements effectively mimic Haar random unitaries in applications depending on second-order moments, while offering the advantage of efficient circuit implementation.  For instance, randomized benchmarking leverages random Clifford sequences to efficiently estimate gate fidelities [21, 23], and classical shadows utilize random Clifford rotations to concisely represent quantum states for efficient property determination [16]. In both cases, the efficient implementation of random Clifford elements is paramount.\n\nFurthermore, Clifford circuits facilitate basis changes in quantum simulation algorithms. They can diagonalize commuting Pauli operators, reducing circuit depth in quantum chemistry simulations [30], or identify and eliminate qubits based on symmetries, simplifying the simulation [8, 28].\n\nWhile asymptotically optimal Clifford circuit synthesis exists, achieving *practically* optimal circuits with minimal entangling gates, specifically CNOT gates, remains a challenge.  We prioritize CNOT minimization due to the higher cost of entangling gates in physical implementations, initially disregarding connectivity constraints.  While ignoring connectivity can theoretically increase CNOT count or depth in the worst-case scenario (e.g., implementing a long-range CNOT gate in a linear architecture), the difference between all-to-all and Linear Nearest Neighbor (LNN) architectures appears relatively small based on known upper and lower bounds [7, 15, 22, 26].  Adapting our methods for specific connectivity constraints and depth minimization is straightforward.\n\nExisting methods for exactly optimal Clifford synthesis are computationally expensive, limited to six qubits [10]. This necessitates efficient heuristics for larger circuits.  This paper presents heuristic approaches for synthesizing and optimizing Clifford circuits, bridging the gap between impractical optimal methods and suboptimal, albeit asymptotically optimal, techniques. Our synthesizer reduces the tableau representation of a Clifford unitary to the identity, while our optimization approach extends and modifies template matching [24] and peephole optimization [27].\n\nOur optimization process involves three stages. First, the synthesized circuit is partitioned into \"compute,\" \"swap,\" and \"Pauli\" stages.  Pauli and swap gates are pushed to the end, allowing the \"compute\" stage to be optimized using templates. The \"swap\" stage is then optimized by merging swaps with CNOT or CZ gates."}

If $G = (V, E)$ and $H = (W, F)$ are graphs such that $W \\subset V$ and $F \\subset E$, then $H$ is a subgraph of $G$. The subgraph $G - e = (V, E \\setminus \\{e\\})$ is obtained from $G$ by deleting the edge $e$.\n\nWe denote the path with $n$ vertices by $P_n$, the complete graph by $K_n$, the complete bipartite graph with $n = n_1 + n_2$ vertices by $K_{n_1, n_2}$, and, in particular, the star graph by $K_{1,n-1}$. A wheel graph of order $n$, $W_n$, is formed by connecting all vertices of a cycle of order $n-1$ to a single universal vertex called the hub. The pineapple graph, $K_p^q$, is obtained by appending $q$ pendant edges to a vertex of a complete graph $K_p$, where $q \\geq 1$ and $p \\geq 3$. The binomial tree $BT_k$ is defined recursively: $BT_0$ consists of a single vertex, and $BT_k$ consists of two binomial trees $BT_{k-1}$ linked by an edge (see Figure 1).  The line graph of $G$, denoted by $L(G)$, is constructed as follows: each edge in $G$ corresponds to a vertex in $L(G)$, and two vertices in $L(G)$ are adjacent if their corresponding edges in $G$ share a vertex.  Note that $L(P_n) = P_{n-1}$ and $L(K_{1,n-1}) = K_{n-1}$ (see Figure 2).  The general Zagreb index, introduced by Gutman and Trinajestic [2], is defined by $Z^{(p)}(G) = \\sum_{i=1}^n d(v_i)^p$ for $p \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $p \\neq 0$ and $p \\neq 1$.  This index seems to have been first considered by Li et al."}
{"text": "Prompt-tuning has emerged as a promising method for adapting pre-trained language models (PLMs) to downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks, especially in few-shot scenarios (Gu et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2022; Ye et al., 2022).  By freezing the PLM's parameters and training only a small set of prompt parameters with limited data, well-optimized few-shot prompt-tuning achieves performance comparable to full model fine-tuning across various PLM sizes and NLP tasks (Gu et al., 2022; Lester et al., 2021). This success has motivated adversaries to explore prompt-based Trojan (or backdoor) attacks (Xu et al., 2022; Cai et al., 2022; Du et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2022; Mei et al., 2023; Xue et al., 2024).  For example, a user might specify an open-source PLM and submit a training dataset to a service provider to request a prompt for a new downstream task. A malicious provider could then return a backdoored prompt.  Upon using this prompt, the PLM would misclassify inputs containing a specific trigger to a predefined target class, while classifying other inputs normally, as illustrated in Figure 1(a).\n\nUnfortunately, existing prompt-based backdoors (Xu et al., 2022; Cai et al., 2022; Du et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2022; Mei et al., 2023) are not compatible with few-shot prompt-tuning.  They require either full model fine-tuning (Xu et al., 2022; Mei et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2022) or extensive training data (Du et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2022).  To achieve a high attack success rate (ASR), methods like BToP (Xu et al., 2022), Notable (Mei et al., 2023), and BadPrompt (Cai et al., 2022) modify a significant number of PLM parameters, making them less stealthy and more vulnerable to backdoor detection techniques (Feng et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2023b).  While PPT (Du et al., 2022) and PromptAttack (Shi et al., 2022) only tune prompt parameters, they require hundreds of training samples for a high ASR. DecodingTrust (Wang et al., 2023) evaluates attacks using hand-crafted prompts on GPT models but doesn't address prompt-tuning scenarios.\n\nConstructing a prompt-based backdoor through few-shot prompt-tuning, while freezing the PLM and training a smaller set of soft prompt parameters with limited data (e.g., 16-shot), presents several challenges."}

{"text": "Visual attention is crucial for everyday tasks like driving or playing sports.  The information our eyes receive far exceeds our processing capacity [1, 22], so we need a mechanism to prioritize the most relevant objects [37]. This prioritization, performed by human visual attention, is so efficient that we are largely unaware of it.\n\nAttention mechanisms are also vital in computer vision, particularly for tasks mimicking human perception, like video compression where quality loss is imperceptible to viewers [15, 13], or caption generation [30, 8]. Inspired by seminal work on visual attention [36, 35, 21] and its initial computational implementations [16], researchers have developed numerous models over the past three decades [2].  A key concept is the saliency map, representing the probability of focusing on each pixel. The centralized saliency map hypothesis posits that a winner-take-all mechanism selects the most relevant location at each time step [21].\n\nSubsequent models have refined this approach, incorporating the dynamics of human visual selection. Some attempt to improve scanpath prediction by including hand-crafted human biases for fixation selection [29] or by formalizing the increasing importance of top-down cues during visual exploration [18].  Others propose bio-inspired models that identify and rank \"proto-objects\" to determine attentional order [20].  However, these approaches still rely on a centralized saliency map, requiring extensive global computations across the entire visual field. This contrasts with the human visual system, which likely begins processing attention in early visual stages [5, 31] and focuses computation on a limited area [36, 33].\n\nZanca et al. [38, 40] introduced a physics-inspired approach, modeling attention as a continuous dynamic process.  Here, attention is a particle attracted by virtual masses representing details (brightness gradients) and motion (optical flow) within the scene.  Applicable to both static images and videos, this model also incorporates inhibition of return, reducing the saliency of previously explored areas [40]. Crucially, it bypasses the centralized saliency map, operating directly on early representations of basic features.  This offers advantages for real-time applications and enables the characterization of eye movement patterns, achieving state-of-the-art scanpath prediction despite its simplicity.  However, these gravitational models require access to all retinal information to calculate the total attraction from virtual masses, limiting their biological and computational plausibility due to their non-local nature.\n\nThis paper proposes a paradigm shift in calculating attraction, inspired by the relationship between global gravitational/electrostatic forces and the local Poisson equation. While Newtonian gravity implies instantaneous signal propagation, a static Poisson potential doesn't truly reflect the local processing of the human visual system because it requires solving the equation for each frame.  It misses the temporal dynamics of peripheral vision."}

{"text": "The first law of Quantum Economics states that currency doesn't exist until it's observed.  This might seem paradoxical: how can money be observed if it doesn't exist until observed?  The answer lies in the quantum foam, where at any moment, the potential exists for funds to spontaneously generate.\n\n\"But sir,\" Jennifer interjected, \"if money can be generated spontaneously, why isn't it constantly appearing everywhere?\"\n\n\"An excellent question, Jennifer, leading us to the second law of Quantum Economics: currency is generated and lost in reverse proportion to your awareness of it.

{"text": "Decision trees are widely used in machine learning due to their interpretability and ability to capture complex relationships within data.  This is particularly valuable in areas like clinical settings, where the direct link between the model and the original data is crucial.\n\nA standard decision tree uses a sequence of ordered splits applied to the data.  Traditionally, these trees are learned using a greedy, one-step-ahead heuristic, with the CART algorithm [3] being a prominent example, producing point-estimate predictions.\n\nRecent research has shifted towards probabilistic approaches [9] to quantify model uncertainty. Bayesian inference, while effective, introduces complexities in computing the necessary distributions. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are frequently employed to approximate these distributions using the law of large numbers [25].  The convergence rate of MCMC depends on the correlation between samples, making sample quality—both low correlation and high likelihood—essential for performance. While progress has been made, generating high-quality samples remains a significant challenge and the primary focus of this paper.\n\nThe core difficulty lies in simultaneously exploring the tree structure and its parameters.  This \"transdimensional\" nature, where the problem dimension changes with the tree structure, poses a challenge for MCMC methods.  Early work by Buntine [4] explored Bayesian averaging and smoothing for decision trees, demonstrating improved predictive accuracy over heuristic methods.  Subsequently, Chipman et al. [5] and Denison et al. [6] independently proposed MCMC-based stochastic sampling methods.  Both introduced tree-specific moves (grow, prune, change, and swap) to transition between trees, each transition representing a new sample in the chain, and observed improvements in accuracy, sometimes surpassing non-Bayesian methods.\n\nFurther advancements refined these MCMC moves.  Wu et al. [26] introduced the \"radical restructure\" move. Gramacy and Lee [10] leveraged binary search tree theory to enhance the swap move, later generalized by Pratola et al. [20], who also improved the change move.\n\nSequential Monte Carlo (SMC) offers an alternative sampling approach.  Unlike MCMC, which modifies a single tree iteratively, SMC evolves a set of \"particles\" (representing trees) with likelihood-based weighting.  Taddy et al. [24] explored SMC for online learning with incrementally arriving data, while Lakshminarayanan et al. [14] used it for batch learning with locally optimal moves.  However, these methods often rely on local random walks, which may propose unlikely trees, leading to low acceptance rates in MCMC and particle degeneracy in SMC. The exception is Lakshminarayanan et al.'s [14] locally optimal proposal, which, while using likelihood, remains local.  This localized approach can hinder posterior exploration due to slow convergence and poor mixing.\n\nThis paper proposes a method to improve acceptance rates and predictive accuracy by integrating Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling into the tree proposal scheme.  HMC leverages the likelihood's geometry for efficient sampling [2], using the derivative of the negative log-posterior as a \"potential energy function\" to guide joint updates of continuous parameters.  However, applying HMC to decision trees is complicated by their piecewise constant likelihood, which is not everywhere differentiable. To address this, we introduce two novel parameterizations: adaptation-phase hyperparameters, inspired by Linero and Yang [15], to soften the hard split constraint, and an input selection method to soften the splitting index parameter.  These techniques aim to mitigate low acceptance rates common in existing methods, potentially improving testing accuracy while simplifying tree structures.\n\nThis paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the decision tree model, notation, and problem definition. Section 3 details the novel RJHMC-Tree algorithm, including its two implementations, proposal scheme, and acceptance probabilities."}
{"text": "Teaching evolution via natural selection faces a central challenge: its counter-intuitive nature stems from the vast spatial and temporal scales over which it operates, making it difficult to observe and understand. This has become a particularly controversial issue in the United States educational system in recent decades (Sinatra et al., 2008).  While various efforts aim to address this, incorporating evolution into games offers a promising approach by presenting the concept in a non-confrontational, accessible format.\n\nSeveral games have attempted this, but encounter recurring issues.  The inherent directionless nature of natural selection often clashes with the need for directed gameplay, leading developers to introduce artificial goals. This reinforces the misconception of a guiding force in evolution, as seen in games like Spore (Bean et al., 2010).  Furthermore, some educational games prioritize scientific accuracy over enjoyment, resulting in limited player engagement. Even successful games that balance both face the challenge of reaching a wide audience. Finally, overt marketing of a game as being about evolution can alienate those resistant to the concept.  Therefore, an effective game must 1) accurately implement natural selection, 2) be enjoyable, 3) attract a large player base, and 4) avoid explicit focus on evolution.\n\nDeveloping such a game is challenging, so we propose an alternative: modding.  Community modifications (mods) to existing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) games offer a compelling solution.  Modding leverages established, popular games with existing fanbases, ensuring enjoyment and reach.  It also allows for \"stealth learning\" by presenting the mod as a realism enhancement (Sharp, 2012), bypassing resistance to evolution. This approach has precedent in both formal educational settings (Moshirnia, 2007) and informal learning environments, where students modify games to explore academic concepts (Bertozzi, 2014; Hayes and King, 2009; Steinkuehler and Johnson, 2009).\n\nWe explore the potential of artificial life research for teaching evolution through game mods and present a proof-of-concept mod for Stardew Valley. This popular \"country life RPG\" (Barone, 2020), with over 5 million owners (Orland, 2018) and an active modding community, provides an ideal platform. Our mod targets the fishing mechanic, enhancing gameplay while subtly integrating principles of natural selection. This demonstrates the feasibility of embedding evolutionary concepts within existing games for educational purposes."}
{"text": "Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced at the Labour congress an extension of the government's small business loan scheme until the end of the year, providing continued support during uncertain economic times.  Originally set to expire on July 24, the scheme offers interest-free loans for up to one year (3% interest thereafter) with no repayments required for the first two years.  This extension ensures businesses facing potential future cash flow difficulties will retain access to crucial funding.\n\n“This means those businesses who are doing okay now, but who may experience cash flow difficulties further down the track, will still have access to it,” Ardern told the assembled party members at Te Papa.  Later, speaking to media, she emphasized the advantage of these loans over cash grants (as previously recommended by Treasury and the National Party), highlighting the flexibility they offer. “Sometimes they’ve drawn it down not necessarily needing it straight away, but being concerned they wouldn’t be able to access it down the track. What this does is say that if you don’t need it, you don’t have to apply but it will be there for several more months.\"\n\nEligibility criteria remain unchanged: businesses with 50 or fewer employees who qualified for the original wage subsidy can apply for loans of $10,000 plus $1,800 per equivalent full-time employee, up to a maximum of $100,000.  The existing $5.2 billion allocated to the scheme remains sufficient, as Small Business Minister Stuart Nash previously stated that uptake was not expected to reach this maximum figure, which was based on every eligible business applying.\n\nSince May 12th, over 90,000 small businesses have applied for loans totaling more than $1.51 billion. The majority of applicants operate in construction, accommodation, restaurants and cafes, retail trade, transport, and manufacturing. Data shows that around 80% of applicants have one to five employees, and over 90% have ten or fewer. \"The average value of each loan is modest, around $16,700. But it is much-needed working capital to help in a tight spot,\" Nash said."}

{"text": "Autonomous vehicles hold potential, but significant safety concerns remain.  The lack of driver engagement poses several risks.  Drivers with nothing to do may become complacent, falling asleep or losing focus, rendering them unprepared to take control in emergencies.  This disengagement could also lead to increased distractions and risky behavior within the vehicle.  Maintaining driver attention is crucial for the safety of everyone on the road.\n\nFurthermore, the reliability of autonomous systems is a major concern.  Like any complex technology, these systems are susceptible to malfunctions and breakdowns.  Manufacturing defects, software glitches, or sensor failures could have disastrous consequences.  A malfunctioning GPS, for example, could lead drivers far off course, while a critical system failure could leave the driver stranded or worse.\n\nConsider this scenario: You're enjoying a lively conversation in your autonomous vehicle, completely unaware of an approaching hazard requiring driver intervention.  The system, designed to alert you, malfunctions.  The car continues autonomously, believing you're in control, and tragically strikes a construction worker.  The result?  Significant financial and legal repercussions.\n\nThese examples highlight the inherent dangers: driver inattention, system malfunctions, and the potential for unforeseen circumstances.  Relying on autonomous technology could foster a culture of complacency, particularly among younger drivers, teaching them to abdicate responsibility.

Ce modèle économique a déjà fait ses preuves.\n\nLe lancement de la version payante concerne simultanément la France et les États-Unis.  Cependant, c'est outre-Atlantique que l'application semble avoir le plus fort potentiel.  \"L'usage audio est plus développé dans le monde anglo-saxon.  Sans rien faire, déjà le quart de nos utilisateurs sont des Américains\", explique Alexis Botaya, ex-CEO du média Soonsoonsoon.  L'habitude d'écouter des podcasts en marchant, en voiture ou en faisant du sport, fonctionnalité offerte par Elocance, est en effet plus répandue aux États-Unis.  Elocance y affrontera des concurrents comme Pocket ou l'allemand Blinkist, ce dernier comptant déjà 10 millions d'adeptes sur un créneau similaire (résumé d'ouvrages en texte ou en audio).\n\n\"En Europe, les pays latins ont un train de retard sur les pays scandinaves, patrie de Spotify, et l'Allemagne où est né Blinkist\", observe Alexis Botaya.  Elocance cible, comme ses concurrents anglo-saxons, un public CSP+ composé de gros consommateurs d'information souhaitant se tenir au courant et se former, notamment dans le cadre professionnel.  Cette consommation de contenus (articles, newsletters, mails, documents PDF…) en format audio se développe au détriment de la lecture traditionnelle partout dans le monde.  Une étude de Global Market Insights prévoit d'ailleurs que le marché du \"mobile e-learning\" pèsera plus de 60 milliards d'euros en 2026, contre 20 milliards actuellement.\n\nElocance vise 2,5 millions d'inscrits, dont 50.000 utilisateurs payants, d'ici fin 2020.  Pour atteindre cet objectif, la start-up de six personnes doit encore surmonter deux obstacles."}

{"text": "My wife and I were strapped for cash when we discovered her pregnancy – a \"happy accident,\" as we called it, though terrifyingly so.  We scraped together enough for the Unauthorized Reproduction fine and the minimum deposit on an Offspring Care Guarantee Fund, subsisting mainly on Soylent. (Seriously, I still can't believe that stuff became popular.)\n\nFaced with the Genetic Aptitude Test, we opted for a free version.  They weren't well-regarded – mostly a way for the wealthy to justify their expensive \"Corporate Head Huntress\" results while the rest of us were supposed to believe a \"People's Minister\" future was possible.\n\nThe results arrived, and we tossed them.  Registering a child's aptitude before birth felt unnecessary.  We could always hope she'd prove herself in school, despite the system being rigged against those without pre-determined career paths.  Besides, the title the scientists assigned… we figured anything would be better.\n\nFinancially tight, the pregnancy itself was relatively smooth. (Don't tell my wife I said that.)  Her scheduled morning sickness, thanks to medication, and the sympathy pains I barely felt (though I may have vomited the pill fifteen minutes before she went into labor – oops) made it manageable.\n\nThen came the standard three-hour labor, ten women to a room, the line of doctors, and Mayor Baby Kissinger lurking in the corner.  Most politicians detest cord-cutting ceremonies, but not him.  He relished them, using them for re-election fodder.  \"Mayor Baby Kissinger loves our youth!\" the headlines would scream.  He even had special gold-plated hemostats.  The whole thing was creepy.\n\nSo, about that Genetic Aptitude Test… We can't find the certificate, but it's irrelevant now.  I doubt the Ten Years Of Age Renaming will contradict it.  Call us negligent, but the TYOAR fee seems pointless.\n\nOur family isn't known for schmoozing.  Mayor Kissinger was furious when our daughter, P.B., cut her own cord.  He'd planned on it being his hundredth ceremonial snip, a perfect photo op.  He wasn't too pleased when she also bit him during his attempted celebratory kiss.  Guess those fancy hemostats didn't do much for his missing lips.  Purely ornamental, it seems.\n\nNow I'm filling out these Offspring Liability Acceptance forms.  It feels like profiling.  Do you think Pussy Grabber IV had to jump through these hoops for Pussy Grabber V?  Bullshit."}
{"text": "The treaty, finally ratified after arduous negotiation, marked a turning point. Earth's ambassador prepared to deliver a speech that would reshape human and galactic history.  Thirty-some alien species, comprising the Galactic Republic, had approved Earth's membership by a vote of 274 to 66 in their Parliament. The condition: the complete eradication of music from human existence. In return, humanity gained access to advanced technology through trade, ten seats in Parliament, and virtual immunity from military threat.\n\nReaching this point had taken fourteen months. Silencing independent artists had been relatively easy. Web hosts blocked music streaming services and aggressively scanned for audio files.  However, mainstream musicians fiercely resisted the clumsily named Initiative for Intergalactic Peace and Quiet—the UN’s campaign to eliminate music. Records were destroyed, CDs melted, and personal music players crushed.  The campaign escalated dramatically: recalcitrant record executives were jettisoned into the sun, teen idols’ vocal cords severed, and Justin Bieber himself incinerated by the President on live television. Nickelback’s final concert, a smash hit, took place within the Large Hadron Collider. These extreme measures, however regrettable, were deemed necessary for human survival. The Republic possessed weapons of unimaginable power, and their hatred of music was absolute.\n\nDespite the existential threat, humanity was deeply reluctant to sacrifice a vital part of its culture. Secret plans were hatched. Backroom deals were struck, clandestine networks activated, and elaborate traps laid.  Meanwhile, Earth's scientists worked covertly to understand the aliens' profound aversion to music.  Theories emerged regarding biochemical and behavioral impacts on certain species, but the exact reasons remained elusive. Did music control them, or did it erode their self-control? Was it an existential threat to their regime, or an addictive substance?\n\nThe War on Music remained a mystery. Humanity’s gamble rested on the belief that the Republic would fracture if enough of its citizens were exposed to music. What better moment than the eve of their apparent victory, when they would all be watching the induction ceremony? The plan came together at the last possible second, as the ambassador approached the microphone.  The world, indeed the galaxy, held its breath, anticipating humanity's peaceful entry into the Galactic Republic. The speakers crackled, the teleprompter scrolled, and the ambassador began:\n\n> **\"Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you...\"**"}

Le départ de Bouna Sarr au Bayern Munich au dernier jour du mercato et l'absence d'un véritable concurrent pour Dario Benedetto sont les principales raisons de son mécontentement. Le technicien portugais souhaitait le remplacement immédiat de Sarr (par Joakim Maehle du KRC Genk, par exemple) et l'arrivée d'un avant-centre confirmé avant la clôture du marché. Faute de renforts à ces deux postes clés, l'OM se retrouve démuni, ce qui irrite Villas-Boas.  D'après *L'Équipe*,  « la perte de Bouna Sarr, non compensée pour l'instant, et l'absence de cet avant-centre » sont les deux points qui « agacent vraiment AVB ».  Même l'arrivée de Luis Henrique, ailier de formation et non avant-centre comme le désirait le coach, n'a pas apaisé le Portugais, qui souhaitait un joueur capable de concurrencer, voire de remplacer, un Dario Benedetto jugé de moins en moins performant.\n\nSi Villas-Boas avait insisté pour le recrutement de Benedetto à l'été 2019, il semblerait que,  en privé, l'entraîneur soit de plus en plus circonspect quant aux performances de l'Argentin.  *L'Équipe* affirme que, « s'il défend l'Argentin en public, le technicien portugais se montre de plus en plus réservé en privé sur les performances de l'ancien joueur de Boca Juniors ».\n\nPour tenter de calmer leur entraîneur, les dirigeants marseillais seraient déjà à la recherche de latéraux, notamment Fabien Centonze (FC Metz) et Kenny Lala (RC Strasbourg), pour pallier le départ de Sarr et offrir une alternative à Hiroki Sakai."}

{"text": "Businesses often focus on tangible benefits like salary, perks, and benefits—easily measurable spreadsheet items—to drive employee happiness.  However, these represent only half the equation. Intangible benefits are arguably more important, fostering a positive culture where employees feel empowered and motivated to excel.\n\nWhile any company can lure talent with flashy perks, neglecting existing, loyal staff creates a detrimental imbalance.  This approach not only breeds resentment among current employees but also attracts individuals motivated by perks rather than mission or values. At TaskUs, we believe short-term rewards attract short-term employees.\n\nLeaders must cultivate a compelling culture that allows their teams to flourish. Happy employees are more productive, boost customer satisfaction, and ultimately drive revenue growth. Conversely, poor leadership, inadequate communication, and a lack of voice contribute to employee churn and company instability.\n\n**Servant Leadership**\n\nLeadership shapes culture.  Servant leaders prioritize the well-being of their teams, placing the needs of others first to foster employee development and maximize potential.  They invest significant time in their people.\n\nFor example, we embrace servant leadership through happy hours at our Philippine operational sites.  Uncommon in Filipino business culture, these work-oriented happy hours differentiate us.  Our leaders serve snacks and drinks to frontline teammates, demonstrating tangibly that management is there to serve them.\n\nWhile such public displays of servant leadership are valuable, the true practice lies in consistent weekly one-on-ones, providing honest and constructive feedback through coaching, and making personal sacrifices for the betterment of direct reports. Servant leaders prioritize serving their employees.\n\n**Transparency**\n\nCommunication and transparency are essential. We empower our staff by sharing our vision and corporate goals, outlining expectations, and illustrating how individual contributions support these objectives. This fosters unified effort and progress.  We believe every team member, regardless of tenure or seniority, can contribute valuable insights.\n\nEach quarter, our executive team dedicates a full day to strategic planning, setting top quarterly goals.  We then dedicate another full day to communicate these goals company-wide, explaining the rationale and encouraging discussion and questions.  Subsequently, each department and individual aligns their goals with these broader company initiatives.  Transparency about company direction, and more importantly, the *why* behind it, fosters a sense of inclusion and purpose.\n\nWhile complete transparency isn't always feasible, sharing information—particularly the rationale behind decisions—cultivates higher employee morale, buy-in, and improved results.\n\n**Listening**\n\nListening to employees is paramount.  By actively listening, we can understand employee needs and address concerns proactively.  We utilize ongoing surveys to give employees a voice and drive positive change within the workplace. Surveys are a powerful tool for predicting and influencing behavior; the simple act of participating in an engagement survey increases employee engagement.\n\nAt TaskUs, leaders undergo 360-degree reviews conducted by a third party, gathering feedback from everyone they work with. Leaders then analyze this input and develop three actionable goals, shared publicly to ensure accountability.  Actionable steps should always follow feedback.\n\nListening extends beyond electronic surveys.  In the Philippines, we provide dedicated dry-erase boards for employee feedback and suggestions.  Our San Antonio office utilizes sticky notes for positive reinforcement, feedback, and ideas. Internal platforms like Facebook groups can also provide valuable forums for employee expression, provided leadership actively monitors these channels.\n\nNumerous avenues exist for listening to employees. While surveys offer a convenient approach, creative methods are equally valuable. Regular check-ins, social events, and community service initiatives contribute significantly to positive employee morale. Ultimately, actively listening to employees and acting on their feedback significantly enhances job satisfaction.\n\nThe difference between a good company and a great one lies in the intangibles.  These include empowering employees, demonstrating their impact, and fostering a sense of belonging to something larger than themselves.  As the Beatles wisely observed, money can't buy you love.  Similarly, lavish perks cannot guarantee happiness.  While intangible benefits may be \"free,\" they require a genuine investment of time and personal commitment at every organizational level."}

{"text": "Visual navigation is central to most autonomous robotic applications, such as self-driving cars and service robots.  A key challenge for these robots is efficiently exploring and robustly identifying navigable space, ultimately finding the shortest paths within complex, obstacle-filled environments.  The robotics and deep learning communities have developed models trained with reinforcement learning (RL), inverse RL, or imitation learning. These models target complex scenarios requiring visual reasoning beyond simple waypoint navigation, enabling novel interactions, like responding to queries such as, \"Where are my keys?\"  However, current learning algorithms require vast amounts of data—hundreds of millions or even billions of interactions—to achieve such capabilities.  Acquiring this data using physical robots in real-world environments is impractical and time-consuming, potentially leading to robot damage.\n\nTo address this, the field relies heavily on simulation, which allows training to proceed significantly faster on modern hardware.  Multiple simulated environments can be easily distributed across numerous cores and machines.  However, neural networks trained in simulated environments often perform poorly when deployed in the real world due to the \"sim-to-real gap.\"  This gap stems from inaccuracies in simulating real-world conditions, including image acquisition, sensor noise, furniture changes, and other displaced objects.  The exact nature of this gap is often difficult to pinpoint.  Even subtle, sometimes imperceptible, adversarial examples—like a few pixel shifts—can significantly alter a trained model's decisions [12, 20, 27].\n\nVarious methods address the sim-to-real gap, including domain randomization, which treats reality as a single parameterization within a vast range of simulations [25, 37], and domain adaptation, which explicitly adapts a simulation-trained model to the real world [6, 40].  However, identifying the sources of the sim-to-real gap could help experts design and optimize transfer methods by targeting specific simulator and agent design choices."}

Le nombre de personnes menacées par la famine est passé de 42 millions en début d'année à 45 millions, selon une nouvelle évaluation du Programme Alimentaire Mondial (PAM).  L'Afghanistan, où trois millions de personnes supplémentaires sont désormais confrontées à la famine, illustre tragiquement cette tendance.\n\n« Des dizaines de millions de personnes sont au bord du gouffre. Les conflits, le changement climatique et la pandémie de Covid-19 ont exacerbé la famine aiguë », a déclaré David Beasley, directeur exécutif du PAM.  Après une visite en Afghanistan, où le PAM vient en aide à près de 23 millions de personnes, il a ajouté : « Les dernières données indiquent que plus de 45 millions de personnes sont menacées par la famine. »\n\nM. Beasley a souligné les multiples facteurs aggravants de cette crise : « La hausse des prix du carburant et des denrées alimentaires, conjuguée à l'augmentation du coût des engrais, alimentent de nouvelles crises comme celle que connaît actuellement l'Afghanistan, et aggravent des situations d'urgence préexistantes, comme au Yémen et en Syrie. »\n\nLe coût de la prévention de la famine à l'échelle mondiale atteint désormais sept milliards de dollars, contre 6,6 milliards en début d'année,  mettant à rude épreuve les mécanismes de financement traditionnels.\n\nFace à l'insécurité alimentaire aiguë, les familles sont contraintes à des « choix déchirants », selon le PAM.  Mariages précoces, déscolarisation des enfants, ou encore consommation de criquets, de feuilles et de cactus pour survivre sont autant de conséquences dramatiques.  En Afghanistan, des témoignages rapportés par la presse font état de familles contraintes de vendre leurs enfants pour survivre, alerte le PAM.\n\nL'Afghanistan est particulièrement touché par la conjonction de sécheresses répétées et d'un effondrement économique.  En Syrie, le PAM estime que 12,4 millions de personnes – un nombre record depuis le début du conflit il y a dix ans –  ne savent pas comment se procurer leur prochain repas.\n\nLe PAM signale également des situations de famine aiguë en Éthiopie, en Haïti, en Somalie, en Angola, au Kenya et au Burundi."}

{"text": "Susan always had a way with words.  She could give a semicolon a personality; she was *that* good.  She helped me navigate school and taught me how to write (hopefully, it worked).  Her skill wasn't just about crafting beautiful sentences; it was about manipulating the truth. She could tell you something unpleasant in such a way that you wouldn't realize what she truly meant. For example, when she hadn't done her homework, she’d sheepishly tell the teacher she hadn't \"figured out\" the problem – not that she *couldn't*, but simply that she *hadn't*.  When people asked her opinion on their clothes, she'd either be brutally honest or deflect with compliments about individual features. That girl was amazing.\n\nMy arms and legs were riddled with scars, testaments to a life less carefully navigated, but her ebony skin had always been pristine.  It became a point of fascination – a symbol of health to some, a source of worry for others – especially after Susan and I lost touch.  During those years, whispers reached me.  Susan wasn't doing well, but she wouldn't reveal what was wrong, weaseling her way out of every conversation with her characteristic tongue-twisting. No one could figure out the truth.\n\nI saw her again at a New Year's Eve party.  I spotted her familiar black hair through the crowd, but when I approached, her appearance shocked me.

The author champions Venusian exploration, highlighting its potential past as the most Earth-like planet in our solar system and emphasizing the scientific curiosity it ignites, while acknowledging the dangers and uncertainties involved.  As explained, \"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth.\"\n\nThe author discusses NASA's innovative concept of using a blimp-like vehicle to study Venus, offering a potential, albeit risky, solution for human exploration.  \"Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth,\" illustrates this ambitious approach.\n\nFurthermore, the author highlights NASA's and other researchers' ongoing efforts to develop alternative methods of Venusian exploration, including innovations that contribute to our understanding of the planet and comparisons of the challenges and potential benefits.  This is exemplified by the exploration of robust technologies: \"Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions."}
{"text": "Life on Venus: Hot or cold? This question drives our exploration of this fascinating planet.  An article exploring the study of Venus reveals intriguing and little-known facts, prompting us to consider the value and dangers of such research. Is studying Venus worth the risk?  The author clearly believes it is, and presents compelling reasons why.\n\nOne of the author's key arguments rests on Venus's similarity to Earth.  It's the closest planet to us in terms of density and size, earning it the nickname \"Earth's twin.\"  However, this resemblance is superficial. Venus's thick atmosphere, composed of 97% carbon dioxide, creates incredibly high pressure and the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. These extreme conditions pose significant challenges to exploration.\n\nVenus may have once shared Earth-like characteristics, potentially harboring vast oceans and even life, as evidenced by remnants on the planet's surface.  Despite its current inhospitable environment, Venus still possesses valleys, mountains, and craters, suggesting a landscape that once mirrored Earth's.  Scientists theorize that Venus was once much like our own planet, but now can no longer support any known life forms.\n\nNASA is actively seeking innovative methods to send humans to Venus for further study.  Their focus is on developing technology that allows exploration without direct surface contact, perhaps by floating above the scorching landscape.  A crucial challenge lies in overcoming the immense atmospheric pressure, comparable to deep beneath Earth's oceans.  Successfully landing on Venus would dramatically expand our understanding of this enigmatic planet."}

{"text": "Camera image signal processors (ISPs) enhance raw image quality through various modules, including the crucial white-balance module.  This module corrects color casts caused by lighting and camera sensitivity by estimating the scene's illuminant color.  Conventional methods, operating under the simplifying assumption of a single global illuminant, typically use only a single frame for this estimation, even in modern high dynamic range (HDR) pipelines that capture multiple exposures.  This is illustrated in Figure 1, where despite the availability of multiple frames, traditional methods utilize only one (e.g., auto-exposed, merged, or a single burst frame).  This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages the inherent dual-exposure nature of HDR imaging to improve illuminant estimation.\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, our method utilizes the long (I<sub>l</sub>) and short (I<sub>s</sub>) exposure frames readily available in multi-exposure bursts or staggered HDR sensors.  We achieve comparable or superior performance with lightweight models (∼300-6000 parameters), contrasting with existing methods employing hundreds of thousands or millions. (Note: In this and subsequent figures, raw images have applied gamma for visualization, and sRGB images are rendered using the HDR+ camera pipeline.)  Conventional single-frame illuminant estimation, represented by:\n\nEQUATION\n[ l<sub>R</sub> , l<sub>G</sub> , l<sub>B</sub> ]<sup>T</sup> = f (I),\n\nwhere I and I<sub>WB</sub> are the 3 × k RGB colors of the raw and white-balanced image respectively, k is the total number of pixels, diag(.) creates a 3×3 diagonal matrix, l ∈ R<sup>3</sup> is the illuminant color vector, T denotes transpose, and f is the estimator function.  These single-frame estimators fall into two categories: statistical methods based on image statistics (e.g., colors, edges), and learning-based methods trained on labeled datasets.  While learning-based methods generally outperform statistical ones, they often suffer from camera dependency, requiring adaptation for new cameras.\n\nModern HDR ISPs capture multiple exposures to enhance dynamic range, either through burst capture or staggered HDR (sHDR) sensors. These exposures are combined to produce a final image with greater dynamic range.  While these pipelines offer access to multiple frames with potentially beneficial information, conventional methods, both in single-frame and HDR pipelines, often underutilize this data.\n\nA few attempts have been made to move beyond single-frame illuminant estimation.  Examples include C5 [4], which uses additional unlabeled images from the test camera, and a method by Xing et al. [62] incorporating depth information from a ToF sensor.  Abdelhamed et al. [2] leveraged dual-camera setups common in mobile phones.  Similar to [2], our method utilizes multiple frames within the ISP. However, unlike [2] and [62], which require dual cameras or additional sensors, our approach leverages the readily available dual-exposure frames within the HDR pipeline (Figure 1).\n\nOur method can be represented by modifying the previous equation to:\n\nEQUATION\n\nOur objective is to design the function *f* to effectively utilize the information provided by the dual-exposure images, I<sub>l</sub> and I<sub>s</sub>."}

{"text": "Hate speech is a widely used term lacking a universally agreed-upon definition.  Often understood as attacks targeting individuals or groups based on inherent traits, its subjective and contextual nature leaves interpretation open to individual users, media platforms (Meta, 2022; Twitter, 2022; Youtube, 2022; Microsoft, 2022b), and research groups (Djuric et al., 2015; Saleem et al., 2017; Mondal et al., 2017; Salminen et al., 2018; Jaki and De Smedt, 2019; Pereira-Kohatsu et al., 2019; Rani et al., 2020; Röttger et al., 2021). This ambiguity makes it particularly challenging to distinguish hate speech from toxic speech or even humor employing irony, sarcasm, or euphemisms.  Furthermore, definitions can be fluid (Vengattil and Culliford, 2022).\n\nThis inherent ambiguity poses significant challenges to building robust hate speech classifiers. While large tech companies possess the resources to develop and maintain their own systems, smaller companies and media outlets face significant hurdles.  They often lack the in-house expertise and resources, and data protection regulations restrict sharing data with commercial services.  The Swiss context presents further complications. Many hate speech instances are deeply embedded in Switzerland's multilingual, sociocultural, and political landscape (cf. e.g. Stevenson, 1990; Hega, 2001; Brügger et al., 2009; Mueller and Dardanelli, 2014; FDFA, 2020), going undetected by existing classifiers.  This challenge was compounded by the lack of annotated Swiss hate speech data for training a reliable baseline classifier at the time of this study.\n\nTo address this gap, we developed a human-in-the-loop hate speech classification framework designed for long-term stability and practical deployment."}

{"text": "The simultaneous arrival of a new Little Women film and a television series about Emily Dickinson has sparked a conversation about how we reimagine the lives of girls and women of the past.  Both projects offer fresh takes on 19th-century New England, specifically the 1860s, and the interior lives of young women constrained by societal expectations.  This shared context makes comparing the two projects particularly compelling.\n\nGreta Gerwig's adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's *Little Women*, boasting a star-studded cast, promises a modern sensibility while remaining faithful to the source material.  The trailer showcases a dynamic portrayal of the March sisters, highlighting their ambition, talent, and struggles against societal limitations. Gerwig’s use of Alcott’s own letters, as evidenced by Jo’s impassioned speech about women’s minds and souls, demonstrates a commitment to capturing the spirit of Alcott's vision.  This approach suggests a balance between historical context and contemporary resonance, aiming to make the story feel relevant to a modern audience.\n\nIn contrast, Apple TV's *Dickinson*, starring Hailee Steinfeld, takes a more radical approach to its subject matter.  The trailer presents a rebellious, almost anachronistic Emily Dickinson, challenging the historical image of the reclusive poet.  This Dickinson embraces fame, plays air guitar, and seeks out passionate encounters.  While visually compelling, this portrayal raises questions about historical accuracy and the potential prioritization of \"Girl Power\" aesthetics over the nuances of Dickinson's complex inner life.  The series appears less concerned with faithfully representing the poet and more interested in using her name as a hook for contemporary audiences.\n\nThe different approaches of these two projects raise important questions.  In a media landscape saturated with reboots and adaptations, how much creative license is acceptable?  Is historical accuracy essential, or can these reimagined stories offer valuable new perspectives?  *The Favourite*, for instance, demonstrated that historical accuracy isn't always necessary for a compelling and successful narrative.\n\nBoth *Little Women* and *Dickinson* are derived from rich source material. Alcott’s *Little Women* is semi-autobiographical, reflecting her own experiences growing up.  Dickinson's poetry, though often interpreted through the lens of her secluded life, offers glimpses into a passionate and imaginative mind.  These projects, along with previous adaptations of both stories, highlight the enduring fascination with these figures.\n\nUltimately, the success of these projects will depend on their execution.  Trailers, designed to generate excitement and anticipation, don't always reflect the final product.  Whether these adaptations will resonate with audiences and offer meaningful insights into the lives of these women remains to be seen.  However, their very existence underscores the continued relevance and richness of the female experience, past and present.  The territory of girlhood, as these projects demonstrate, continues to offer fertile ground for exploration, even if faithfulness to historical detail sometimes takes a backseat to creative interpretation."}

{"text": "Scene text recognition (STR), the task of reading text from natural images, is a fundamental challenge in computer vision [15, 31, 32, 42, 46]. Early methods treated STR as a symbol classification problem [19, 31], but these struggled with images containing visual complexities like occlusion and noise. Recognizing that scene text embodies both visual and linguistic information, recent approaches, inspired by Natural Language Processing (NLP) [5, 23], incorporate linguistic context to improve recognition [28, 45, 46, 47].  These methods typically employ a two-step architecture (Fig. 1, top left), with a vision model processing visual features and a separate language model (RNN [32], CNN [7], or Transformer [45]) capturing character relationships.\n\nHowever, this two-step approach suffers from two key limitations: high computational cost, especially with longer words due to the language model's complexity (linear growth for RNN/CNN, quadratic for Transformer; Fig. 1), exacerbated by bi-directional architectures [32, 38, 45]; and the difficulty of effectively fusing the visual and linguistic information from two separate modules [7, 46].  We argue that these limitations stem from the vision model's lack of linguistic awareness; it focuses solely on visual texture [45].\n\nInspired by the human ability to acquire language [11, 21], we propose a novel approach (Fig. 1, bottom) where the vision model learns linguistic context directly (Fig. 5).  During training, the vision model is guided to reason about occluded characters, effectively integrating linguistic information within the visual processing stage.  In testing, this enables the model to adaptively leverage linguistic cues to enhance visual features, particularly in challenging scenarios like occlusion or noise, effectively supplementing and clarifying visual cues. To our knowledge, this is the first STR method to imbue the vision model with linguistic understanding."}

Según estimaciones de la Organización Mundial de la Salud, en torno a 60 millones de personas en el mundo la sufren.\n\nUn diagnóstico precoz es crucial para un mejor manejo de la enfermedad, evitando más episodios y mejorando la calidad de vida.  El doctor José Manuel Montes explica: “En la mayoría de los casos, el trastorno bipolar comienza con síntomas depresivos, y el paciente no es correctamente diagnosticado de depresión unipolar hasta que aparece la euforia, mediante síntomas maníacos o hipomaníacos”.  El especialista añade: “En otras ocasiones, el trastorno se inicia con síntomas psicóticos, que pueden confundirse con otros trastornos, sobre todo en personas que consumen sustancias. También, la hipomanía puede pasar más desapercibida cuando es muy breve y no hay una disrupción”.\n\nLos síntomas de los episodios de manía incluyen: euforia o irritabilidad, autoestima exagerada o sentimiento de grandeza, disminución de la necesidad de dormir, estado más hablador de lo habitual, pensamiento acelerado, facilidad de distracción, aumento de la actividad, participación excesiva en actividades placenteras o con riesgo, y gastos excesivos, entre otros.\n\n\nEl tratamiento para el trastorno bipolar es fundamentalmente farmacológico, pudiendo incluir un programa de psicoeducación. El doctor Montes apunta al litio como tratamiento estándar por su eficacia, aunque cada vez se emplean más los antipsicóticos.  Según los expertos, los efectos secundarios a largo plazo del tratamiento son menores comparados con los problemas que conlleva el trastorno bipolar, por lo que “no se ha de tener gran preocupación al respecto”, afirma Montes.\n\nAdemás del tratamiento farmacológico, es recomendable la psicoterapia. El psicólogo Mateo Pérez explica que “es bueno que el paciente siga un programa de psicoeducación,  que consiste en adquirir conocimientos sobre el propio trastorno y la necesidad de seguir el tratamiento adecuadamente. También se adquiere un conocimiento que ayuda a detectar y prevenir nuevos episodios”.\n\nLa falta de información sobre el trastorno bipolar es un problema significativo.  Mateo Pérez denuncia la falta de divulgación y reivindica campañas sobre esta enfermedad y la salud mental en general, ya que muchos pacientes y sus allegados desconocen que la padecen.  Comenta que, en una muestra de 120 sujetos, casi al 50% no se les había informado correctamente sobre el trastorno.

{"text": "In the field of robot vision, the performance of object detectors has dramatically improved since the adoption of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction.  Well-known detectors like SSD [20], YOLO [22], RetinaNet [19], Faster R-CNN [23], and Mask R-CNN [14] typically operate on single images.  When applied to video, the traditional approach involves per-frame detection followed by object tracking to associate detections across frames. However, this method fails to leverage temporal information inherent in video sequences, limiting detection performance.  Furthermore, video often suffers from degraded image quality due to motion blur, defocusing, unusual poses, and occlusions.  This inconsistency burdens object trackers and necessitates detectors designed to exploit temporal information for robust performance.\n\nRecently, video object detectors (VoDs) have emerged, utilizing multiple consecutive frames for detection [2, 3, 6, 12, 27-29]. Some methods [2, 12, 28, 29] fuse CNN feature maps to enhance object representation. Others [3, 6, 27] associate object proposals across frames and fuse the associated features to improve quality.  Still others [8, 26] exploit object motion and camera variations to extract representations of moving objects.\n\nThis paper introduces a novel VoD algorithm called Temporal Feature Aggregation and Motion-aware VoD (TM-VoD).  TM-VoD constructs robust object features using finite-length image sequences.  Our design pursues two key objectives: First, aggregating common yet diverse object representations across multiple frames, adapting to temporal variations in feature location and quality. Second, exploiting temporal motion patterns to derive rich, discriminative representations, recognizing that different object classes exhibit distinct motion cues.\n\nTM-VoD detects objects using *M* past frames, *N* future frames, and the present frame (illustrated in Figure 1 with *N* = *M* = 2).  It first fuses visual feature maps from CNN backbone networks. To maximize aggregation effectiveness, TM-VoD performs two-stage alignment and weighting.  Pixel-level gated feature aggregation weights CNN feature maps based on their relevance to the detection task. Subsequently, region proposal network (RPN) proposals undergo Temporal Box Offset Calibration (TBOC) alignment and weighting based on cosine similarity between present and adjacent frame features.  TM-VoD also extracts object motion representation in two stages. Pixel-level motion features capture incremental changes in adjacent visual feature maps. Box-level motion features are derived from RoI-aligned motion features and corresponding box coordinate sequences. Finally, temporally aggregated features and box-level motion features merge to create a joint object representation. The entire network is end-to-end trainable.\n\nOur key contributions are:\n\n* We propose TM-VoD, exploiting both temporal redundancy in object features and contextual information from object motion. We focus on aggregating relevant, well-aligned visual feature map regions, extracting effective motion representations, and integrating them into VoD. Feature aggregation and motion feature extraction occur hierarchically at both pixel and box levels.\n* We introduce an efficient box regression method for aligning box proposals across frames. Instead of associating all proposal pairs across adjacent frames [3, 6, 27], our method uses initial RPN proposals as anchors and predicts box offsets relative to these anchors for all frames.\n* We evaluate TM-VoD on the ImageNet VID dataset [24].  Our experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements over baseline algorithms.  Furthermore, TM-VoD outperforms existing VoD methods and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art.\n* The source code will be publicly available."}

{"text": "Speech separation models play a crucial role in various speech processing applications, ranging from meeting transcription to assistive hearing [1]-[4]. However, challenges arise when speakers are far from the microphone, introducing noise and reverberation into the signal [5]-[7].  While deep neural network (DNN) models have significantly improved separation performance on anechoic data, a performance gap persists with distorted speech [8]-[10].  Many DNN models utilize Transformer or bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) layers [9]-[11], which have high memory consumption and quadratic time complexity [12].  For *L* input frames, these models perform at least *L*² operations, posing a significant challenge during training due to the need to store gradients for backpropagation [13].  This computational burden leads to longer training times. One approach to mitigate memory requirements is using a batch size of 1 [9], but this further extends training duration due to increased parameter updates.  Another method involves reducing the mixture signal length [14], which can save time but potentially sacrifices performance. This work was supported by the Centre for Doctoral Training in Speech and Language Technologies (SLT) and their Applications funded by UK Research and Innovation [grant number EP/S023062/1]. This work was also funded in part by 3M Health Information Systems, Inc.\n\n\nThis work investigates whether there are time-segment length (TSL) limits beyond which DNN speech separation models achieve no further performance gains.  We demonstrate that, depending on the model and dataset, there exists a TSL limit where not only does performance plateau but limiting the TSL can actually improve performance notably. This effect is attributed to the random sampling of the start index when using TSL limits."}

{"text": "Curiosity is a fundamental human drive, fueling our desire to explore, even in the face of danger or perceived impossibility.  \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" embodies this spirit, arguing for the value of studying Venus despite its extreme environment. The author effectively constructs this argument through several key strategies.\n\nFirst, the author establishes a foundation by highlighting Venus's similarities to Earth.  He notes that \"...Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size,\" suggesting a compelling reason for NASA's interest.  He further acknowledges the history of attempted exploration, stating that \"...humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud-draped world,\"  implicitly acknowledging the inherent challenges.\n\nNext, the author explores potential solutions, specifically referencing NASA's concept of a \"blimp-like\" vehicle.  He explains that such a vehicle, \"...hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.\"  However, he also addresses the limitations of this approach, conceding that observations \"...far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions...\" and hinder sample collection. This inclusion of a counterargument strengthens his overall position by demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved.\n\nFurthermore, the author effectively uses factual information and statistics (appealing to logos, rather than pathos) to bolster his claims, lending credibility to the feasibility of the proposed solutions.  For example, the specifics about the blimp and the data regarding Venus's density and size are presented as evidence to support his arguments.\n\nFinally, the author crafts a compelling conclusion that resonates beyond the specific context of Venus exploration.  He argues that \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\""}

Cette baisse de la production agricole est observable depuis plusieurs années.  L'Organisation des Nations Unies pour l'alimentation et l'agriculture (FAO) constate que la production peine à répondre aux besoins croissants de la population.  Pour la campagne agricole 2016, la FAO estimait les besoins locaux en céréales à 551 000 tonnes (dont 331 000 tonnes de riz usiné, 75 000 tonnes de maïs et 145 000 tonnes de blé), contre 437 000 tonnes en 2015.\n\nUne étude de la Banque mondiale corrobore ce constat.  Si l'indice de la production totale a augmenté ces 30 dernières années, l'indice de la production nette par habitant a, quant à lui, significativement diminué. Cette augmentation de la production agricole est principalement due à l'expansion des surfaces cultivées, et non à l'adoption de technologies ou d'intrants plus performants.  Ce modèle agricole exerce une pression considérable sur les ressources naturelles de Madagascar.\n\nMalgré les efforts de sensibilisation des agriculteurs à l'amélioration des techniques culturales, les rendements restent faibles : 2,5 tonnes/ha pour le riz, 1 tonne/ha pour le maïs et 0,9 tonne/ha pour le haricot.\n\nR.

Tonight, Tim Hall would regret every single time he’d bullied me.  Tonight, with a little supernatural assistance, I would get my revenge.\n\nThe candle flames sputtered, then died.

Then, it whistled.  \"Ahhhhh shit.\"  Dusting off its rear, and then giving its tail a swipe as if cleaning it, it rose.\n\n\"Listen kid, bear with me here.

Trust me, there wouldn't even *be* a house left if he popped in.\"\n\nI swallowed, speechless. The demon shrugged and returned to admiring my posters, one hand thoughtfully stroking its chin.  \"So anyways, I really hope you called for something simple.

Gotta pop a few kids before you graduate to CEOs and Warlords, ya know?\"  It gestured at my *Phantom Menace* poster. \"And to think Lucas did that all on his own.\" Sighing, it sat on my bed and patted the space beside it, inviting me to join.  This wasn't how I’d envisioned this at all.\n\n\"Come on, come on,\" it said, waving an impatient hand. \"I was busy when you called. It's 5:00 pm. Didn't you ever hear of witching hour?\" It raised a hand to stop my reply. \"Don't answer that. Never mind. So what can I do for you?\"\n\nFinally finding my voice, I squeaked, \"Tim Hall.\" The demon rolled its eyes and circled its finger, urging me to continue. \"He bullies me, and I'm tired of it.\"\n\nThe demon crossed its arms. \"Ok, what do you want me to do to him?\"\n\n\"I don't know...\"  I hadn’t actually thought about the consequences of summoning a *real* demon.\n\n\"Oh Jesus. You call me during the day, *and* you don't even have a clear idea of what you want? Here, hold on.\"  With outstretched hands, it conjured a book from thin air, wreathed in flames.  Then, from the same fire, a pair of reading glasses appeared.

{"text": "My essay argues against the value of using technology to read students' emotional expressions in the classroom. I believe that technology cannot accurately interpret emotions simply by scanning a student's face.  It cannot delve into someone's mind and definitively declare their emotional state. We, as humans, are better equipped to understand each other's emotions because we can empathize, having experienced similar situations.\n\nEven if such technology were accurate, I would object to its use. Imagine its potential misuse as a government tool to identify individuals concealing information. Inaccurate readings could lead to unjust consequences. Conversely, if the technology, such as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), were to misinterpret crucial emotional cues, vital information could be missed.\n\nSome may argue that if this technology were real, it would represent a significant technological advancement, paving the way for future innovations.  However, I remain skeptical of its ability to accurately interpret human feelings.  Practical questions arise: What size would such a device be?  Would it be massive, like a gymnasium, or compact, like an iPhone 4?  These unanswered questions further fuel my doubts, leading me to believe this technology is merely a fabrication."}
{"text": "Image classification is a fundamental problem in computer vision and machine learning, used to categorize images into predefined classes of objects.  Unlike traditional image classification where the entire image is available for processing at once, sequential image classification processes images as long sequences, one pixel at a time. Deep learning techniques, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and deep neural networks (DNNs), have been extensively used and well-developed for image classification. RNNs, whose development is attributed to authors [1], [2], and [3], are widely believed to outperform CNNs and DNNs for sequential data.\n\nThis study has two main parts. First, we review state-of-the-art network architectures for sequential image classification. Second, we introduce a novel feature construction method aimed at reducing training time while increasing both training and testing accuracy.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section II presents the basics of recurrent neural networks, including deep independent RNNs and temporal convolution networks. Section III details our proposed feature construction method.  Section IV presents performance results for state-of-the-art networks, as well as results for LSTM and BiLSTM architectures.

Évoquant les relations bilatérales, il a déclaré : « Cette soirée se veut conviviale, mais je tiens d'abord à rendre hommage aux victimes de la récente attaque terroriste de Tabankort.

Une opération qui, il faut le souligner, a infligé de lourdes pertes aux terroristes. »\n\nM. Meyer a ensuite reconnu que certains Maliens perçoivent la relation franco-malienne comme exclusivement militaire, centrée sur Barkhane. « Barkhane joue certes un rôle essentiel, et je lui rends hommage, mais notre relation ne se limite pas à l'aspect militaire. »  Il a rappelé que le Mali fait partie des 19 pays prioritaires de l'aide française au développement.  « Depuis novembre 2016, la France consacre la moitié de ses subventions à ces pays.  Nos contributions aux institutions multilatérales œuvrant pour le développement, notamment dans le domaine de la santé, sont importantes.

L'enjeu concerne la sécurité du Mali, de la sous-région et du monde entier. »\n\nCette intervention médiatique de Joël Meyer survient alors que Barkhane essuie de vives critiques de la population, qui juge son action insuffisante face à la dégradation de la situation sécuritaire au Mali et au Sahel, notamment dans ses zones d’intervention.\n\nAmadou Basso\nSource : Ziré"}
{"text": "The ever-dutiful machines whirred and hummed around me as I climbed out of the Assisted Hibernation suit. Every bone and muscle screamed with the familiar ache. \"This is my last contract,\" I muttered, the same lie I told myself after every mission.  I choked down the usual cocktail of electrolyte, protein, and carbohydrate supplements, each one more foul than the last, and washed the gritty residue away with water before pulling on my uniform.\n\nThe locker room was empty, suggesting I was the first awake.  The computer chimed, informing me we were home. Anticipating the crew's awakening, I dusted off the celebratory Champagne and put it on ice. I sat down at the communications terminal. \"This is Exploratory Probe Six-Eight-Twelve, do you read me?\"\n\nOnly static answered.  Micrometeorites, I figured, must have damaged the communications array. I’d try again when we entered visual range.  Still, it was odd that no one else was awake.  I climbed back up to the weightless center of the ship where the hibernation pods were located.  The crew wasn't dead, but their pods all flashed Status Critical: Oversleep; Cannot Waken.  At least we’d be in orbit within the hour, where I could hand this problem off to someone more qualified.\n\nI returned to the communications array, where the Champagne sat chilling.  A shimmering blue star shone ahead – Earth! I uncorked the bottle, surprised at the force required to pull the cork free.  The Champagne poured flat.  “Typical corporate cost-cutting,” I grumbled, pouring myself a glass and toasting my terminal before taking a sip.\n\nThe taste shocked me.  It wasn’t the lack of bubbles, but a sharp, woody taste, like licking a tree or an old book.  A warning flashed on the terminal: “Hyperdrive Failure.” Not my department.\n\nThe blue dot of Earth was now the size of my pinky nail.  Even with a damaged communications array, we had to be in range.  I tried hailing again. A few beeps, then static. On the last mission, autopilot would have taken over by now, correcting our orbit and prepping for unload.\n\nHours bled into one another as I ran diagnostics on the communications system and checked internal fuses.  Everything appeared in perfect order.  Continents and swirling clouds now resolved themselves on the blue-green marble of Earth.  I snapped a few pictures for my family back home.  Only automated satellites responded to my hails, and even their replies were fragmented.  Finally, we entered orbit, the dark side of Earth rotating into view. I manually corrected our trajectory, a process that took over an hour.  Through the viewport, the crescent Earth, mostly shrouded in night, reflected no light.  Like a new moon, the night side was completely black.  We were over an ocean. I took more pictures for my family and tried the comms again. More static.\n\nWith a damaged array, I was helpless. I wasn’t certified for external repairs. All I could do was wait."}

{"text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — El historial de Joe Biden como vicepresidente de Barack Obama presenta un obstáculo para conectar con el electorado hispano, un grupo demográfico crucial para su aspiración presidencial.  El recuerdo de las deportaciones de aproximadamente tres millones de personas sin autorización legal durante la administración Obama, que le valió al expresidente el apodo de \"deportador en jefe\", pesa sobre la imagen de Biden para muchos latinos.\n\nEste factor, entre otros, contribuyó al abrumador apoyo que Bernie Sanders recibió del electorado latino durante las primarias demócratas.  Ahora, con la retirada de Sanders, los hispanos se enfrentan a una disyuntiva compleja:  ignorar el pasado de Biden y votar por él, o abstenerse y arriesgarse a cuatro años más de Donald Trump, quien recientemente firmó un decreto que limita la inmigración durante la pandemia.\n\n\"Un regreso al 'status quo' no resulta atractivo para quienes sienten que tienen una bota en el cuello\",  afirmó Marisa Franco, directora y cofundadora de Mijente,  grupo activista que apoyó a Sanders en su primera incursión en la política electoral.\n\nEl gobierno de Obama justificó las deportaciones como una demostración de firmeza ante la ley migratoria, a la espera de una reforma por parte del Congreso.  Sin embargo, un alto porcentaje de los deportados no tenía antecedentes penales, a pesar de la insistencia del gobierno en priorizar la expulsión de criminales.  Eventualmente, Obama, reconociendo la inacción del Congreso,  amplió las protecciones para jóvenes inmigrantes con DACA (Acción Diferida para los Llegados en la Infancia), programa que aún enfrenta litigios en tribunales federales.\n\nBiden defendió la política migratoria de Obama durante mucho tiempo, llegando incluso a decirle a un activista en Carolina del Sur que \"votara por Trump\" si le preocupaban las deportaciones. No obstante, ante la inminente derrota en Nevada, estado con una importante población hispana,  reconoció que \"tardaron demasiado en hacer las cosas bien\" y calificó la situación como \"un gran error\".\n\nDomingo García, presidente de LULAC (Liga de Ciudadanos Latinoamericanos Unidos),  señaló que muchos en el ala más liberal de la comunidad latina ven este tema como una \"prueba de fuego\" y algo difícil de olvidar.  Sin embargo,  otros activistas argumentan que el racismo de Trump representa una amenaza mayor.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez,  influyente voz progresista,  ha expresado su intención de votar por Biden, aunque lo ha instado a  priorizar  las problemáticas de la comunidad hispana.  Sanders también ha respaldado a Biden y ha pedido a sus seguidores que lo apoyen para derrotar a Trump.\n\nEl presidente republicano mantiene una postura firme en materia de inmigración, considerándola crucial para movilizar a su base. Su reciente decreto prácticamente garantiza que la inmigración será un tema central en la campaña electoral.\n\nSi bien el gobierno de Trump deportó a aproximadamente 267,260 personas en el año fiscal 2019, una cifra menor al récord de 410,000 deportaciones de la era Obama en 2012,  ha aumentado el número de personas detenidas mientras se procesan sus casos y ha enviado a  60,000 a México a esperar sus audiencias."}

Dr. Dobson, a recently retired orthopedic surgeon with over 30 years of experience, traded his scalpel for a needle a year ago to vaccinate his fellow community members.\n\n\"It's been rewarding,\" Dr. Dobson remarked. \"The people coming in to be vaccinated are incredibly positive and grateful to be here.\"\n\nVolunteers comprise up to two-thirds of the staff at the clinic, Miller explained.  They come from both medical and non-medical backgrounds and undergo comprehensive training before volunteering.\n\n\"We simply couldn't do it without them,\" Miller emphasized. \"It would be impossible. We wouldn't have the necessary manpower or resources.\"\n\nDue to a recent decline in demand for the vaccine, the clinic has been scaled down, Miller noted.  Volunteers like Dr. Dobson hope to see an increase in vaccinations soon.\n\n\"I feel for the people who aren't getting vaccinated,\" he expressed. \"I'm glad for those who are, as they're protected.

Johannes felt his face flush. Hardly anyone dared enter Edmunds's office without an appointment.  Luckily, his disheveled state—greasy hair and a wrinkled biosafety suit—seemed to warrant her full attention.  She must have been working double shifts, he thought.\n\n\"If this is what I think it is,\" Johannes began, \"you'll have every big pharma company knocking at *your* door.

Edmunds sat up straighter, leaning forward, her brow furrowed in inquisitive concern as she scanned the numbers.\n\nSample 1215: at long last, a positive hit.\n\nA rare smile slowly spread across Edmunds's face, blossoming into a wide grin.  Eyes shining, she said, \"We spent five years on the edge of this colony, hoping to find a new therapeutic compound to combat the cancer on Earth…\"  Her hand fluttered to her chest, resting over her heart. A violent cough seized her, spasms racking her thin frame.  She covered her mouth with her other hand, and when she pulled it away, spots of blood stained her palm.  She hastily wiped her hand on a handkerchief, already dotted with similar stains. The familiar dull throb returned to her chest.\n\nJohannes offered her water, which she gratefully accepted. After a pause, she continued, \"We took a risk coming here. They said we wouldn't find anything near the mines. But that turned out to be our advantage. What was Sample 1215?\"\n\nJohannes, his initial caution replaced by excitement, explained, \"Sample 1215 was one of the few organic compounds found in the soil excavated from the mines. There's life down there, likely bacterial, producing this compound in significant quantities. Mass spectrometry revealed a unique peptide sequence, unlike anything on Earth, though there's some homology to *Micromonospora* soil bacterial proteins.\" He paused for breath – the lower oxygen content of the Mars facility always a factor.  \"When introduced to cancer cells *in vitro*, it killed almost all of them without harming non-cancerous cells.  In animal models, it appears to inhibit angiogenesis. So, in addition to its cancer-specific cytotoxicity, it prevents blood vessel growth to the tumor.\"\n\nEdmunds slowly rose, her smile unwavering."}

However, their opaque decision-making process hinders human trust and raises ethical (Durán & Jongsma, 2021; Lo Piano, 2020) and legal (Wachter et al., 2017; EUGDPR, 2017) concerns (Rudin, 2019; Bussone et al., 2015).  Consequently, interpretability has become a core research area in responsible AI (Rudin, 2019).\n\nConcept-based models (Kim et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2020) strive to improve trust by leveraging human-understandable concepts to train interpretable models like logistic regression or decision trees (Rudin, 2019; Koh et al., 2020; Kazhdan et al., 2020) (Figure 1).  This approach, by clarifying the model's decision process, significantly boosts human trust (Rudin, 2019; Shen, 2022).  However, state-of-the-art concept-based models often rely on concept embeddings (Yeh et al., 2020; Kazhdan et al., 2020; Mahinpei et al., 2021; Espinosa Zarlenga et al., 2022) for improved performance. These embeddings lack clear semantics on individual dimensions. For instance, ĉyellow = [2.3, 0.3, -3.5, . . . ] T lacks semantic meaning assigned to each dimension.  This trade-off between interpretability and model capacity can reduce human trust, as noted by Rudin (2019) and Mahinpei et al. (2021).\n\nTo address this limitation, we introduce the Deep Concept Reasoner (DCR, Section 3), the first interpretable concept-based model built on concept embeddings."}

{"text": "General Ephal's speech began to fade as Alek's mind wandered.  \"Men, remember that what you do is not for yourselves alone…\"  He knew the drill. Just like every battle before, their role was to soften the enemy ranks, paving the way for the \"real heroes\" to confront Lord Arthgon and banish him back to the Fifth Realm.  Standing among his fellow soldiers, Alek wondered if they harbored similar thoughts. He recalled a dream from months ago – a vision of himself upon a throne of gold, encrusted with gems and precious stones.  He knew it was a fantasy, yet the possibility, however remote, was intoxicating.\n\n\"Now,\" Ephal's voice cut back into Alek's awareness, \"we march on the keep! And remember to take them with you! CHARGE!\"  The men surged forward.  Swords clashed, a cacophony of metal on metal, and blood sprayed across the battlefield.  Then, Arthgon emerged from his tent.  Raising his staff, he unleashed fireballs into the ranks of both armies. Alek narrowly dodged a searing blast that grazed his head.  Suddenly, Sir Reginald appeared – the six-foot paladin, supposedly divinely chosen to vanquish Arthgon.  Reginald drew his sword and charged.\n\nThe duel was breathtaking.  Fighting all but ceased as soldiers watched the two titans clash.  With no one left to fight nearby, Alek edged closer, hoping to glean some fighting technique or tactical advantage. Perhaps he could even write a book about this epic battle, the final confrontation that would end the brutal war.  Then, disaster struck. Reginald lost his footing and fell.  Panic seized Alek.  He snatched a discarded bow, notched an arrow, and fired.\n\nThe arrow found its mark, striking Arthgon squarely in the throat. The warlord clutched at his neck and collapsed.  Reginald rose, locking eyes with Alek.  Alek stood stunned, the unexpected consequence of his desperate shot reverberating through him. He hadn't aimed to kill Arthgon outright; he'd only meant to buy Reginald time.  The look of utter disbelief mirrored on both their faces.  Reginald sank to his knees, weeping."}

In the suffocating darkness, he imagined his three companions huddled in the positions he'd last seen them before they'd turned off their flashlights to conserve batteries.  His good friend Andrew, the wiry architect of this ill-fated expedition, stood with arms crossed. Tom sat on the ground, knees pulled tight to his chest. And Stacy, sprawled casually beside her boyfriend (the very existence of their relationship a perpetual mystery to Michael), completed the tableau. A daredevil, a coward, and a pampered princess. Michael didn't like their odds of survival.\n\n“I'm telling you there *isn't* a way out of this,\" Stacy's voice cut through the silence. \"We're completely lost and we'll probably die in here.”\n\n“Andrew, this is all your fault you know,” she added, venom lacing her tone.\n\nIn the darkness, Michael couldn't see Andrew's face, but he pictured him twisting his mouth as if tasting something sour.  “I realize that, Stacy,\" Andrew's voice was sullen. \"That's why I'm trying to think of a way out of this mess.”\n\nTom's nervous attempt at optimism hung awkwardly in the air. “There’s no need to be so pessimistic, Stacy. I mean, I’m sure we can find our way out, right guys?”  His uneasiness was palpable.  Someone shifted uncomfortably.\n\nTom's question still hung in the air, unanswered. Michael wiped his brow again and spoke up, trying to inject some logic into the rising panic. “Our best option is to keep moving, but we need to mark where we've been.  We're bound to find a way out eventually as long as we stay close and only use one flashlight at a time.”\n\n“Assuming we don't die of thirst or fall down a pit,” Stacy muttered.\n\nTom flicked his flashlight on, revealing the remaining water in his bottle, then quickly switched it off again. “There’s still about three-quarters left.” Only Tom had thought to bring water.

The lead paints make my head flutter for a moment. I take a sip of gin, peering into the water as the sun paints its own majesty with golden rays across the pond.  I realized long ago I could never reach the ideals of the old Renaissance painters who tried to compare their works to the masterpieces of Heaven. Impressionism never tried to reach for such foolish heights. Instead, the canvas allows us to express our innermost thoughts with the brush. If my work only spoke about the sorrow I've experienced, the joy I've found, and the regret I've known in life, expressed in imperfect strokes, I consider my work far more valuable than the stark reality Da Vinci has crafted.\n\nAs I packed my materials, a flash of light illuminated from the corner of my eye. Yet another person clad in strange clothes ran towards me, begging for an audience.  “Mr. van Gogh, please,” she pleaded, much like the rest. “You need to listen to me.”\n\nI simply waved her away and continued, supplies in hand, to the street, knowing most of these people don't dare to confront me in public.

At first, I figured they were a prank meant to detract from my art by mocking my failures with false promises of fame, as if anyone would dare cast their gaze upon my paintings and see anything beyond the surface. But their sheer number and insistence has convinced me otherwise.\n\nPerhaps the alcohol has finally invaded my spirit, and these men and women are nothing but delusions meant to torment me. Perchance I've simply gone mad; after all, they refuse to appear in public, leaving me the fool to insist on their existence.

{"text": "Detailed semantic maps are crucial for autonomous vehicles. Most autonomous driving systems rely heavily on these maps for navigation and action planning, augmenting onboard sensor data with information about road areas, traffic signs, obstacles, and more. This is particularly valuable in challenging conditions like dense traffic, occluded scenes, or long distances where sensor performance degrades.  Commercial providers are developing increasingly detailed 3D high-definition maps with rich semantic information.  These maps are highly abstracted from the underlying sensor data, allowing for efficient storage, easy interpretation, and cross-vendor sharing.\n\nPrecise localization within these maps is essential for leveraging their full potential.  This localization must be reliable in all conditions, including GPS-denied areas and complex urban environments.  Traditional visual localization methods often rely on specific handcrafted or learned features as landmarks. However, many real-world maps, particularly those from third parties, lack these specific localization landmarks.\n\nA promising solution is to use the existing semantic and geometric information already present in the maps for higher-level tasks. This approach has several advantages.  First, it enables localization across various existing and future map formats. Second, semantic information is readily available from sensor data through existing segmentation networks often already deployed for other perception tasks. Finally, semantics are largely invariant to environmental changes like weather or season and across different sensor modalities.\n\nOur camera-based localization approach draws inspiration from direct image alignment methods used in odometry estimation [1] and map-relative tracking [2]. We recover precise vehicle pose by aligning camera frames to virtual map views rendered from the semantic map.  Starting with an initial pose estimate (e.g., from GPS or place recognition), our system directly optimizes the vehicle pose, enabling real-time localization.  Requiring only semantically segmented camera images and ubiquitous odometry input, our approach avoids the need for specialized localization landmarks. This versatility makes it applicable to diverse areas, from indoor augmented reality to large-scale outdoor navigation for autonomous vehicles.\n\nOur main contributions are:\n\n* A camera-based localization approach using image alignment with semantic map elements as landmarks.\n* A novel, probabilistically sound semantic image alignment loss function to maximize map-sensor consistency.\n* Extensive evaluation on three datasets with diverse map formats and ablation studies demonstrating the efficacy of our method.\n\nII. RELATED WORK\n\nGiven the extensive research in vehicle localization, we focus our review on image-based methods and relevant approaches utilizing semantics or direct image alignment."}

{"text": "This paper investigates the problem of sampling from a distribution  *p*(**X**) = *e*⁻ᵝ*f*⁽**ˣ**⁾/ *Z*, where *Z* is the normalizing constant, for specific families of non-convex functions *f*(**X**).  Access to *f* is provided through a value and gradient oracle.  This problem mirrors the classical optimization setup of minimizing *f*(**X**) with the same oracle access, a standard framework for quantifying query complexity.\n\nWhile various efficient algorithms exist for sampling from *p*(**X**) when *f*(**X**) is convex (i.e., *p*(**X**) is log-concave), the general non-convex case is challenging.  Ge et al. (2018b) demonstrated an exponential lower bound on the required query complexity.  However, non-log-concave sampling remains practically relevant due to its wide applicability:\n\n1. **Bayesian Inference:**  When dealing with noisy observations of a random variable **X** with a prior distribution, the posterior often takes this form.  The inverse temperature, β, reflects the noise level.  Large β emphasizes **X** values close to the observation (as measured by *f*(**X**)), while small β yields a higher-entropy distribution around the observation. This paper considers cases involving \"measurements\" *A*(**XXᵀ**) of a low-rank matrix perturbed by Gaussian noise, encompassing problems like noisy matrix factorization, matrix sensing, and matrix completion.  The goal here is to sample from the posterior, rather than simply obtaining a single low-error estimate.\n\n\n2. **Sampling in Energy-Based Models:**  Many state-of-the-art generative models, particularly in vision (Song and Ermon, 2019; Du and Mordatch, 2019), employ the energy-based paradigm, where *p*(**X**) ∝ *e*⁻*f*⁽**ˣ**⁾ for a parametric function *f* (e.g., a neural network).  Sampling is typically performed using Langevin dynamics.  Manifolds of equiprobable points are a natural structural assumption, as image distributions often exhibit rich symmetries (e.g., rotations, translations). The distributions analyzed in this paper are invariant under orthogonal transformations, a fundamental symmetry group with practical relevance."}
{"text": "The \"Face on Mars\" wasn't created by aliens.  The scientific consensus points to natural landforms as the sole explanation.  It's unlikely aliens would carve a face into a rock; what purpose would that serve?

{"text": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm connecting everyday objects, or \"things,\" to the internet.  These objects are typically equipped with sensors and actuators.  A recent study estimates that up to 75 billion connected IoT devices will be in use by 2025 [1].  Examples of IoT devices include smartphones, medical sensors, and wearables.  These devices often possess augmented capabilities such as sensing, networking, and processing [2]. The ubiquity of the IoT presents opportunities to crowdsource the capabilities of these devices [3].\n\nCrowdsourcing IoT devices involves integrating these \"things\" by leveraging their data and functionality to create novel applications [3].  Crowdsourced applications include environmental monitoring, smart grids, and healthcare applications [3].  Abstracting crowdsourced IoT devices can further provide novel services [4]. These IoT services are defined by the functional and non-functional properties of the devices [4]. Examples of such services include Wi-Fi hotspot sharing and energy sharing [5, 6].\n\nEnergy sharing, also known as Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS), is defined as the transfer of wireless energy among IoT devices using a service paradigm [5]. An energy provider is a device that can share energy, while an energy consumer is a device that requires energy.  Both consumers and providers are user-owned.  Energy can be harvested through wearables like smart textiles or smart shoes [7], capturing energy from resources such as body heat or kinetic movement [8].  For instance, the PowerWalk kinetic energy harvester provides 10-12 watts of on-the-move power [8]. Users wearing a PowerWalk harvester on each leg can generate enough power to charge up to four smartphones during an hour's walk at a comfortable pace [9]. This harvested energy could be shared with nearby IoT devices as EaaS using newly developed \"over-the-air wireless charging\" technology [10].  Wattup technology, developed by Energous, is one example, enabling wireless charging up to distances of 15 feet.<sup>2</sup> This work focuses on the use of wearables and IoT devices as energy providers.\n\nProviding EaaS offers several advantages.  It is a crowdsourced, green solution, utilizing spare and renewable energy.  EaaS provides an alternative to using the power grid, offering a more convenient solution than carrying power banks or searching for a power outlet.  Recently, interest in wireless crowdcharging has increased [11]. EaaS is particularly valuable in situations where a power outlet is unavailable, such as disaster management, entertainment venues, and emergency response scenarios [9]. The envisioned environment typically consists of microcells – confined areas where people congregate, such as coffee shops, restaurants, and movie theaters. Within these microcells, devices can share energy using the EaaS model.  We assume a trust framework is implemented, securing the IoT environment for crowdsourcing EaaS [12].\n\nAs previously mentioned, the EaaS model is defined by its functional and non-functional (QoS) properties [5]. The function of the energy service is the transfer of energy among IoT devices. The non-functional properties describe the quality of service, including energy capacity, location, and duration. To the best of our knowledge, existing research primarily focuses on EaaS composition from the consumer's perspective [5]. Our research focuses on the selection and composition of energy service requests from the *provider's* perspective.\n\nOne of the main challenges in composing EaaS is provider resistance. This resistance often stems from the limited resources of IoT devices and a lack of trust [13]. While providers may altruistically share energy to benefit the environment, they can also be egoistic, as energy is a critical resource for their own devices. Incentives can encourage providers to share energy, compensating them for their resource consumption.  To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior research on incentivizing users to provide wireless energy sharing. Existing incentive models for crowdsourced environments are not applicable to EaaS, as the context of wireless energy sharing requires a customized model [13].  We focus on designing a novel incentive model for selecting and composing energy service requests.\n\nOur proposed incentive model considers the factors influencing a provider's willingness to participate. Incentive models rely on intrinsic or extrinsic rewards to motivate participation. Intrinsic rewards involve internal satisfaction motivated by altruistic purposes. In contrast, extrinsic rewards are driven by material compensation [14]. This work focuses on computing extrinsic rewards using our incentive model, as intrinsic rewards are self-motivated.

Recruited – or perhaps kidnapped – by the government for his unique talents, he worked tirelessly towards a single, desperate goal: a weapon against the ever-growing army of the dead.  Every morning began in Lab A, tweaking and 3D-printing prototypes of his tiny bio-organic explosives, each containing a small explosive charge, fiber optics, microelectronics, and encased in synthetic skin. He'd implant these into lab rats, only to find them dead in Lab B the following morning.  But this morning was different.  He heard noises from Lab B.  The rats lived.\n\nA surge of elation coursed through him.  Not just relief from the grim task of cleaning rat carcasses, but the profound realization that humanity might finally have a fighting chance. After confirming the rats were healthy and the devices functional, he immediately called Colonel Telt, his captor, now seen as a comrade in this desperate war.  He then rushed back to Lab A and, using just one of the hundreds of 3D printers at his disposal, began constructing three larger prototypes, increasing the explosive charge and the length of the fiber optics while retaining the same miniature CPU.\n\nWithin ten minutes, the Colonel arrived.  \"You sounded excited, Mark,\" he said. \"What you got for me?\"\n\n\"It's done, sir,\" Mark replied, his voice brimming with conviction. \"We can start human trials. I volunteer.\"\n\nMark's eagerness stemmed from a primal fear. He had witnessed the reanimation firsthand, a fate worse than death. He dreaded the prospect of joining their ranks, of becoming a threat to the living.\n\n\"Well, Mark,\" the Colonel responded, \"lucky for you, we're not bound by previous government regulations. I was tasked to defeat the dead army, and by God, we're about to turn the tide!\"\n\n\"Sir,\" Mark explained, \"once Dr. Linkens gets here, I'll have her install the implant. If I wake up tomorrow morning, I'll start full production on all printers.\"\n\n\"Sounds like a plan,\" the Colonel agreed.\n\nThat night, Mark went to bed with the implant nestled within him, his mind racing with the grim arithmetic of the war. Until now, it had been a war of attrition, a losing battle against an exponentially growing enemy.  He wasn’t afraid of the device now residing in his own body, a shaped charge designed to obliterate his brain upon cessation of his heartbeat for two minutes, leaving the skull intact. The two-minute delay was a calculated compromise, accounting for the varying reanimation times influenced by the proximity of the undead overlords.\n\n\nHe awoke the next morning filled with a renewed sense of purpose. Tomorrow, the monumental task of implanting the device into every surviving human would begin.  All remaining survivors were gathered in Eastern Russia, making their last stand.  This time, Mark thought, humanity would not go extinct."}

{"text": "Labour MP Clare Curran’s resignation, announced yesterday, brings relief to both herself and the Government, although it reflects poorly on her party.  Curran’s demise, following her stumbling, bumbling non-answer to a question in the House on Wednesday, raises a critical question: how many other MPs are not ministerial material?  Labour ministers are chosen by caucus vote, and Curran's inadequacy was clear to the entire country after her exchange with National's Melissa Lee.  This resignation will undoubtedly encourage further scrutiny from the Opposition, who, like sharks circling prey, are constitutionally tasked with probing the government for weaknesses.\n\nCurran was already a lowly ranked minister before being demoted to a seat outside Cabinet, a consequence of a second failure to properly document meetings with individuals relevant to her portfolios.  While these failings are of public concern, the handling of the situation by those in higher positions of power raises more significant questions.  When Prime Minister Ardern initially demoted Curran, many questioned why she remained a minister at all.  Last week’s events, where Curran failed to coherently respond to Lee's question about her use of personal email for official business, vindicated those concerns.\n\nThe Prime Minister’s judgment is now under scrutiny.  While dismissing someone is difficult, it is a necessary aspect of Ardern’s responsibilities.  Furthermore, Ardern’s commitment to transparency appears to have faltered.  Hours before Curran’s resignation was public, Ardern told Newstalk ZB's Chris Lynch that she had not considered firing Curran, stating that Curran had “paid her price” and that everyone has “bad days.”  This statement, while technically true – Curran offered her resignation – created a false impression, as Ardern knew she had accepted the resignation the previous night.  While Prime Ministers are entitled to avoid pre-empting announcements, transparent evasion is preferable to misleading answers.  Conjecture would have been appropriate, and arguably should be expected, if dismissal were a genuine possibility.\n\nParliament can resemble a sharks' tank, with the Opposition mercilessly targeting any perceived weakness.  Curran's ineptitude provided ample fodder."}

{"text": "When solving partial differential equations (PDEs) numerically using volume discretization, the computational grid must be truncated.  The key challenge lies in achieving this truncation without introducing significant artifacts. Some problems offer natural truncation, such as periodic structures amenable to periodic boundary conditions.  In other cases, rapidly decaying solutions render truncation irrelevant provided the grid is sufficiently large.  For problems with solutions that vary increasingly slowly at larger distances, like Poisson's equation, a coordinate transformation (e.g., x = tanh x) can remap the infinite domain x ∈ (-∞, ∞) to a finite one x ∈ (-1, 1) before solving the resulting finite system.  However, wave equations present a more difficult truncation challenge. Their oscillating solutions typically decay with distance *r* only as 1/ *r* <sup>(d-1)/2</sup> in *d* dimensions. This slow decay makes simple truncation with hard-wall (Dirichlet or Neumann) or periodic boundary conditions unacceptable due to reflections.  Furthermore, any real coordinate remapping to a finite domain results in solutions oscillating infinitely rapidly as the boundary is approached.  These rapid oscillations are unresolvable on a finite grid, effectively creating a reflecting hard wall. Consequently, wave equations require absorbing boundaries that absorb incident waves without reflection and without demanding infeasible resolution.\n\nEarly attempts at absorbing boundaries for wave equations employed absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs).  ABCs are rules for setting the values at the grid edge based on the solution on the interior grid points, unlike simple Dirichlet conditions (which set the solution to zero at the edge and cause reflections).  ABCs attempt to extrapolate from interior grid points to the edge, creating the illusion of an unbounded domain. While perfect absorption is achievable in one dimension, where waves propagate only along ±x, the primary interest in numerical simulation lies in two and three dimensions. The multitude of propagation directions in higher dimensions significantly complicates ABC design, making efficient, exact absorption of waves incident at arbitrary angles unlikely. Existing ABCs typically achieve perfect absorption only at a few angles, particularly normal incidence, relying on the increasing dominance of normal-incident waves on the boundaries as the grid grows.  Another challenge arises when the wave medium is inhomogeneous at the grid boundaries (e.g., simulating transmission around a dielectric waveguide bend). Many standard ABCs, formulated for homogeneous boundary materials, can become numerically unstable in inhomogeneous environments.\n\nIn 1994, Berenger transformed the approach to absorbing boundaries with his seminal work on perfectly matched layers (PMLs).  Instead of focusing on boundary conditions, Berenger proposed an absorbing boundary layer—a layer of artificial absorbing material adjacent to the grid edges (Figure 1). Waves entering this layer are attenuated, minimizing reflections from the grid boundary.  While material transitions generally cause reflections, Berenger demonstrated the possibility of constructing a special absorbing medium that eliminates reflections at the interface. While initially developed for electromagnetism (Maxwell's equations), the PML concept readily extends to other wave equations.\n\nSeveral equivalent PML formulations exist.  Berenger's original split-field PML artificially splits wave solutions into two new field components. A more common contemporary formulation, the uniaxial PML (UPML), represents the PML region using the ordinary wave equation with a combination of artificial anisotropic absorbing materials. Both formulations were initially derived by analyzing the solution for waves incident at arbitrary angles and polarizations, then determining the conditions for zero reflection.  This approach, however, is cumbersome for extending to other wave equations and coordinate systems.  It also overlooks the fact that PMLs remain effective (theoretically reflectionless) in inhomogeneous media, like waveguides, as long as the medium is homogeneous perpendicular to the boundary, even without analytical wave solutions.  Both split-field and UPML formulations can be derived more elegantly through complex coordinate stretching, which analytically continues the wave equations into complex spatial coordinates where fields decay exponentially.  This complex-coordinate approach is the focus of this review.\n\nWe begin by reviewing wave equations, emphasizing the scalar wave equation while providing a general definition.  We then derive PMLs as a two-step process: analytic continuation into complex coordinates followed by transformation back to real coordinates. Finally, we discuss PML limitations, particularly the loss of reflectionless behavior upon discretization, and common mitigation strategies."}

{"text": "For years, car development has primarily focused on design and fuel efficiency, rather than driver assistance.  Given the significant role cars play in most people's daily lives, improving this frequently used machine is a logical step.  A key advancement is the development of autonomous vehicles. While the safety of this technology may initially concern some, car companies are committed to ensuring consumer safety. Though this innovation may face initial resistance, experts predict its eventual widespread adoption.\n\nAutonomous vehicles offer significant safety benefits.  Equipped with LIDAR technology, they react faster than humans, preventing accidents.  Furthermore, they adhere to speed limits, enhancing road safety.  Beyond safety, built-in GPS navigation optimizes routes for maximum efficiency.\n\nDespite these advantages, public apprehension is understandable.  This technology is relatively new, and unfamiliarity breeds concern.  Resistance to change is a common human trait, and the idea of a self-driving car represents a significant shift.  However, history demonstrates that initial resistance often gives way to acceptance.\n\nA primary concern revolves around accident liability. However, technological malfunction is statistically improbable.  Google's autonomous car testing program, for example, resulted in only one accident, which was attributed to human error, not the technology itself. Human error is far more frequent, and regulations will mandate comprehensive safety features in these vehicles.\n\nWhile the concept of autonomous vehicles may be initially daunting, experts foresee their normalization.  Public adoption will likely be gradual, and personal preference will dictate individual choices.  Availability doesn't necessitate universal adoption; the goal is to provide an option for those who desire it. Once the proficiency of safety measures is demonstrably established, there will be little reason to prevent this technology's presence on public roads."}

{"text": "From the beginning, I ask forgiveness of the dead and the living. Silence, please. I have no desire to hear your contempt. Remember, I did not ask for this gift.\n\nIt began in childhood, a summer day. My memory holds only that, and the softness of my mother’s hand. We were walking, strolling, enjoying the sun.\n\nA man approached. His face is lost to me, replaced by a feeling, a number flashing before my eyes: 6.  A sensation unlike any I'd known. The number 6 vibrated through me like violin strings.\n\nI cried, a torrent of tears. The man turned away; my mother remained oblivious. But I no longer truly saw her. I saw her as one sees a distant tree, her face obscured, replaced by a number: 1. It brought a sense of safety mingled with sadness. To be so detached from my mother's face was heartbreaking.\n\nI digress.\n\nSomething was wrong. I saw numbers, instinctively understanding my own strangeness. Where others saw beauty, I saw danger, or safety. But I did not see *him* yet.\n\nHigh school found me a loner, unsurprisingly. Knowing someone is dangerous and avoiding them are two different things. I was bullied by a 6, punched by a 4, locked in the locker room by a 5.\n\nUnderstand, then, my yearning for connection, for a friendship transcending numbers.\n\nHis voice was soft when we met. No, that's not quite right. I ran. He was a 10, a blazing, fire-engine red 10.  I fled, not symbolically, but physically, screaming in terror.\n\nHe persisted. He sat beside me at lunch while I shivered. At first, his presence twisted my soul. He was a *10*.\n\nThen, he saved me. Cornered against the lockers again, he appeared from behind. Three heads were beaten that day. His hands, covered in blood, framed a skewed grin. Their faces, smashed like sponges.\n\nThe logical extension is clear. His first victim fell on a Tuesday. I remember because I’d broken up with my girlfriend the day before. We'd found an 8. His eyes were dark, his gait military."}

{"text": "Braunwyn Windham-Burke dominated the storyline during Season 15 of *The Real Housewives of Orange County*.  Her decision to move into a rental home for filming became a significant plot point.  In an Instagram story video, she explained, “It’s not complicated. We were in our old home, and discovered we needed permits and permission to film there, which I couldn't get. We had only a few weeks, and this house was available, so we took it. You can’t be on a show called ‘Housewives’ without a house!”\n\nShe described the rental: “It’s great. I love it. It works for us now, and we’ll see what happens. As long as I’m on the show, I probably won’t be able to live where I want.” The 8,000-square-foot rental comfortably accommodates her seven children with Sean: Bella, 20; Rowan, 18; Jacob, 15; twins Caden and Curren, 7; and Koa, 5.\n\nThis season also highlighted Braunwyn’s journey with alcoholism and its impact on her family and marriage. Sean briefly moved out while they attended therapy.  Later, Braunwyn welcomed him back on Instagram: “On Wednesdays we smash the Patriarchy! Feeling hopeful! Thank you, [Sean], for being by my side these past few crazy months. We might be doing things our own way, but it’s working. So happy to have you back home #26years #lifepartners #ivegotyou #modernmarriage #renegotiating.”\n\nCelebrating their 20th anniversary this year, Braunwyn and Sean have always embraced their unconventional marriage.  In a *Us Weekly* interview, Braunwyn stated, “I love Sean, he loves me…he’s very supportive. He understands and supports me. I’m living a very authentic life right now, something I’ve never allowed myself before.”\n\nWhile Sean lived elsewhere, Braunwyn noted her older children were supportive, and the younger ones barely noticed.  \"He’s still around the kids as much as he was before,\" she explained. \"He still tucks them in at night… If anything, their dad is spending more *quality* time with them.\"\n\nHouses have been a major source of conflict this season on *RHOC*.  Braunwyn ignited drama by telling the other women that Shannon Beador called Gina Kirschenheiter’s new condo small and “sad.”  Gina shares the 1,600-square-foot home with her boyfriend, Travis Mullen, and their six children.\n\nShannon denied the comment and confronted Braunwyn at her housewarming party.  Later, Braunwyn told Gina that Shannon had been talking about her behind her back, sparking a heated argument that culminated in Braunwyn throwing a glass into Shannon's pool and storming out.\n\nIn an earlier episode, Gina had shaded Braunwyn’s rental choice, saying, “With Braunwyn, it’s all smoke and mirrors, and her house is part of that. I firmly believe she is completely full of sh*t.” She mocked, “‘I rent an 8,000-square-foot home’… You’re an a**hole. Who does that?"}

{"text": "The depth of understanding the evolution of scientific topics arguably determines humanity's ability to advance scientific development and achieve groundbreaking results [20, 21].  This understanding is crucial for effective resource allocation [2, 13], researcher hiring [14, 19], and strategic direction selection [5, 12]. Governments need to identify promising scientific topics to efficiently allocate trillions in research funding [1]. Research institutions must evaluate the potential of a candidate's research area to maximize recruitment benefits.  Individual researchers need to prioritize promising topics to publish impactful work.  However, due to a lack of intuitive and in-depth understanding of scientific topics, their evolutionary laws remain largely unknown.  We propose a \"Scientific X-ray\" framework to address this gap and provide insights into the evolution of scientific topics.\n\nThe explosion of scientific data [1, 2, 3, 4] has fueled interest in data-driven methods to understand scientific evolution [5].  This growth, however, prompts questions about the long-term trajectory of scientific progress.  Futurist Raymond Kurzweil predicts a \"technological singularity\" by 2045, a point where machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence, potentially hindering further human-driven advancement [6].  Similarly, Moore's Law, which has driven exponential growth in computing power, is slowing as chip miniaturization approaches its physical limits [7, 8, 9, 10, 11].  This slowdown, coupled with the concept of the singularity, raises a critical question: does scientific evolution follow a similar life cycle of prosperity and decline [12, 13, 14]?\n\nOur research, analyzing citation trends of 68,675 high-impact publications (citation ≥ 1000, covering 16 disciplines, published from 1800 to 2019), suggests a potential answer.  We observed two dominant processes influencing publication impact: \"birth\" and \"aging\" (Fig. 1).  The \"aging\" phenomenon indicates that even highly influential topics eventually lose momentum and cease to develop further, despite their initial impact.\n\nFigure 1: Statistics on the \"birth\" and \"aging\" of 68,675 high-impact papers. The bar height represents the cumulative number of high-impact articles \"born\" up to a specific time. The dark blue portion represents the cumulative number \"aged\" by that time. \"Aging\" is defined as having no more than 10 new citations annually after a certain year. The light blue portion represents currently active articles.  This figure demonstrates that while high-impact articles continually emerge, some inevitably lose attention over time.\n\nWhile current citation-based metrics [15, 16, 17, 18] offer some insight into the impact evolution of individual publications, they are insufficient for understanding the complex evolution of scientific topics."}

{"text": "\"Help! Please!\" a woman screamed from the darkened alley to the figure walking past. Two men held her against the brick wall behind a dumpster, trying to silence her by forcing a grimy hand over her mouth and growling threats in her ear. The figure paused, glancing into the alley—a gap between two long-abandoned storefronts—at the unfolding crime. The sweatshirt hood obscured the figure's face from the dim streetlights, hiding it from both victim and attackers.  The woman bit down on her captor's hand, giving her the chance to shout again.\n\n\"Do something, please!\" she begged the onlooker.  Another dirty hand clamped over her mouth, followed by a blow to her head, silencing her once more.\n\nThomas winced at the sickening thud of fist against skull. From the alley entrance, he sized up the men assaulting the woman. Conflict raged in his blue eyes as he weighed his options.\n\n\"Get outta here, ya runt!\" one of the men yelled, struggling to restrain the girl.\n\n*Were they actually going to kill her?* Thomas wondered, ignoring their continued threats. *And was her life even worth it?*  He shoved his hands into his corduroy pockets, about to continue his midnight stroll, when his gaze met the bloodied woman's green eyes through the shadows.\n\nHe'd never seen such a hopeless gaze. She'd given up, submitted to her attackers' will.  Looking into those soulless eyes was like looking into empty sockets. Something within Thomas boiled to the surface: sympathy. He'd seen such despair only once before, and in an instant, his mind was made up.  He pushed back his green hood, revealing a mess of blond hair.\n\n\"Leave her alone,\" Thomas yelled, forcing menace into his voice, \"and you may walk away with your lives!\"  The threat lacked conviction; the men chuckled. The smaller of the two stepped back from the woman, the knife he’d been holding to her throat now lowered.\n\nHe wore a black ski mask, but his heavy jacket and rubber boots suggested he was a dockworker.\n\n\"You just made a huge mistake, boy!\" the other man growled, his voice raspy from years of cigarettes. He charged at Thomas, knife brandished.\n\nThomas's pupils dilated, consuming the whites of his eyes as he summoned his curse. The alley's long shadows writhed and squirmed. The charging man ignored the shifting darkness until tentacles of ink streaked from their hiding places and ripped his head from his shoulders."}
{"text": "Two years ago, Systems Engineer David Strauss rebuilt the decaying infrastructure of the German Air Force.  He likened it to reconstructing a building as it crumbled.  This success made him an obvious choice for a highly classified mission.\n\nSix months prior, a new high-resolution telescope orbiting the moon captured something unusual: what appeared to be an opening in a crater wall on the dark side.  Initially dismissed as a smudge on the lens, the anomaly was quickly confirmed. The news was suppressed, those involved were paid off, and doctored images were released to the public.  Behind closed doors, NASA led an urgent meeting with China, the European Union, and Russia. Amidst accusations and even fistfights, the assembled powers agreed: the structure wasn't theirs.  At best, a geological anomaly; at worst, a clandestine military installation built by an unknown entity.\n\nNow, thanks to Russian diversionary tactics and satellite coverage, a Chinese rocket, modified for international use and equipped with cutting-edge technology, carried the mission to the moon.  Onboard were NASA's top scientist, Jackie Hornwell, and the EU's systems and communications expert, David Strauss.  Orbiting above the crater in a command vessel was Phillip Roué, the EU's military communications expert.\n\n\"How's it going guys? Puke bags are under your seats if you need them. You're about 30 seconds from landing.\" Phillip’s voice crackled over the comms.\n\n\"Fuck off, Phillip,\" Jackie retorted.\n\n\"Phillip, let's maintain radio silence until Dr. Hornwell gets her bearings,\" David interjected.\n\n\"Got it, over and out,\" Phillip replied.\n\nThe lander touched down as gently as could be expected.  David ran system checks, confirming everything was operational. \"Ship looks good. Site looks good too. Zero pressure and cold enough for it to burn. Ready to go?\"\n\nJackie, still awestruck by being on the moon, could only think, *They’re finally on the Moon. I am on the Moon!*  \"Ya. Let's go,\" she finally managed.\n\nThey donned their suits, gathered equipment – extra O2 tanks for David, a gear bag for Jackie – and entered the airlock.  David initiated the depressurization sequence. The hissing of escaping air faded, a green light blinked, and the hatch swung open, revealing the lunar landscape. They stepped onto the surface, testing their balance in the low gravity.\n\n\"Alright, Phillip. Where are we supposed to go? Over.\"\n\n\"Northwest of your position. Turn 40 degrees to your left and it's dead ahead. Over.\"\n\n\"Got it. Over and out.\"\n\n\"This way then,\" David murmured, taking small leaps toward the designated location, Jackie following, her gaze fixed on the otherworldly scene.  Fifteen minutes later, the entrance came into view.  Thirty minutes more and they stood before it.\n\n\"Woah… look at that,\" David breathed."}

{"text": "The early morning mist dissipated over the plains as the dragon soared across the mountains, each flap of her leathery, burnished-red wings causing the air to tremble. Sunlight glinted off her scales in scintillating patterns.  She reveled in her dominion, content in her vast domain dotted with the crude buildings of her two-legged cattle.  As her shadow fell, one of the cattle cried out a warning, scattering the others.  She dived, breathing a lick of flame, a perfunctory gesture.  Having eaten a wild goat earlier, she wasn't truly hungry. Though fattened on their tributes of oxen and sheep, she still occasionally snatched a few, just for variety.\n\nHer only real concern was her meager hoard back in her den, a deep crevasse carved into the mountainside.  Despite scouring the plains and settlements, even fighting off lesser drakes for their treasure, her trove remained a miserably small heap of silver and copper coins, a golden chalice, and a suit of gilded armor.  Nowhere near acceptable.\n\nAs she surveyed her territory, a gleam beneath the cloudbanks caught her eye.  A golden shine at the riverside.  Diving down, anticipating another prize, she instead let out a surprised puff of air as the object revealed itself to be alive.\n\nThe sinuous, serpentine creature, barely half her size, drank at the river, seemingly unaware of her presence. It had a lustrous mane, a pair of fine whiskers it fastidiously cleaned in the clear water, and small, curled horns.  And it was covered in golden scales.\n\nFinally, it turned its head towards her.  She blinked, momentarily uncertain. None of her prey had ever been so calm.  But her desire for gold overcame her hesitation, and she lunged, claws extended, holding back her fire so as not to damage her potential prize.\n\nTo her astonishment, the wingless beast took to the air, effortlessly riding the thermals.  She snapped at its tufted tail as it coiled and twisted, facing her head-on.  As she closed in, it shot forward, and she instinctively exhaled a breath of fire. The flames washed harmlessly around the creature as it raked its claws across her snout.  She hissed in pain, droplets of acrid blood flying.\n\nRealizing fire wouldn't harm the creature, she scorched the air with heavy gouts of flame, using the thermals to gain altitude. The creature twisted in the inferno, disoriented.  She dove into the hazy blaze, ripping into it—\n\n—only to have it vanish into motes of light.  Puzzled, she rose from the smoke, circling.  The wind from her wings dispersed the smog, revealing nothing.\n\nShe bellowed in frustration, spewing plumes of smoke.  A shimmering in the air, a gray-lined distortion.  Too late, the creature sensed her approach and turned to flee.  She caught it easily, seizing its throat, shaking it violently.\n\nMoments later, she landed at her cave, the creature limp and lifeless in her jaws. Exhausted from the fight, she dropped the golden carcass atop her hoard and curled up, finally content."}

Los bloques tienen una capacidad limitada de almacenamiento y, cuando se llenan, se encadenan al anterior formando la blockchain.\n\nCada bloque está conectado a su predecesor por un código único llamado hash, creado mediante una función matemática que convierte la información digital en una cadena de números y letras. Este código es fundamental para prevenir ciberataques. Si el bloque se edita, el hash cambia, impidiendo que un usuario elimine o altere registros. La cadena solo puede crecer. Además, cada bloque recibe una marca de tiempo exacta al agregarse a la cadena.\n\nLa seguridad de blockchain reside en la descentralización: cada nodo contiene una copia del libro de cuentas y todos deben verificar y validar por consenso cada transacción.

{"text": "With the increasing penetration of distributed generations (DG), particularly inverter-based energy resources (IB-ER), in active distribution networks (ADNs), voltage violations and high network losses are becoming more severe, especially with reversed active power flow.  While IB-ERs can provide Volt/VAR control (VVC) support, effectively leveraging this capability presents challenges.  Traditional model-based VVC optimization methods, which generate optimal strategies for voltage regulation devices and reactive power resources, struggle due to inaccuracies in network parameters. These theoretical parameters often deviate significantly from real-world operational states, creating a model mismatch that hinders practical application.\n\nThis paper proposes a novel two-stage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for optimizing reactive power distribution in ADNs, addressing the limitations of model-based approaches.  The method combines offline learning with online learning and application, leveraging the benefits of both model-based and model-free control.\n\nIn the offline stage, an approximate ADN model is constructed using theoretical parameters.  Recognizing the inherent inaccuracies, a novel joint adversarial soft actor-critic (JASAC) algorithm is employed within an adversarial Markov decision process (AMDP) framework.  An adversary agent, representing modeling errors and risks, is trained alongside the offline agent (OFF-A). This adversarial training enhances the OFF-A's robustness to model mismatch, minimizing the \"transfer gap\" when applied to the real system.  JASAC leverages shared information between the adversary and OFF-A, ensuring efficient convergence.\n\nThe online stage utilizes the knowledge gained offline. The OFF-A is transferred to an online agent (ON-A), which continues learning and application using the state-of-the-art soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm.  This offline pre-training significantly accelerates online training and improves safety, mitigating the risks associated with deploying untrained DRL agents directly in real-world systems.\n\nThis two-stage approach offers several key advantages: 1) It combines the practicality of model-free online operation with the efficiency of incorporating approximate model knowledge offline. 2) The novel JASAC algorithm, applicable to other DRL applications, efficiently trains a robust OFF-A through adversarial learning. 3) Transferring the robust OFF-A to the online stage significantly improves performance and safety compared to existing DRL-based VVC methods.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section II formulates the VVC problem as an MDP for the online stage and an AMDP for the offline stage.  Section III details the proposed VVC algorithm and JASAC.  Section IV presents and analyzes the numerical results.  Finally, Section V concludes the paper.  VVC has been successfully integrated into distribution management systems to optimize reactive power flow, eliminating voltage violations and reducing network losses. Conventionally, VVC employs model-based optimization to generate optimal strategies for voltage regulation devices and reactive power resources.  Numerous centralized and decentralized algorithms exist, including conic relaxation, interior point methods, mixed integer linear programming, evolutionary algorithms, local control, alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and robust/scenario-based optimization techniques.  However, these methods rely on accurate system models.  Model-free methods, such as those based on game theory or gradient-based optimization applied to wind farm control, offer an alternative.  Recently, DRL algorithms have shown promise in various control tasks, leading to the development of DRL-based VVC methods.  However, online training of DRL agents can be costly and risky. Offline training using simulated ADN models is preferable, but model inaccuracies necessitate specialized algorithms to bridge the transfer gap.

While some believe the so-called \"Face on Mars\" is evidence of extraterrestrial construction, others maintain it's a natural formation.  Recent high-resolution photographs of this Martian feature provide compelling evidence to support the latter view.\n\nNASA's exploration of Mars, beginning with the Viking 1 orbiter in 1976, has yielded increasingly detailed images of the \"Face.\"  Initial photographs, revealing a mesa that resembled a face, fueled speculation about an ancient civilization.  Subsequent missions, including further observations in 1998 and 2001, captured the feature with significantly improved resolution.\n\nDespite claims that the \"Face\" exhibits artificial characteristics, the enhanced photographic detail strongly suggests a natural origin.  Multiple high-resolution images clearly indicate that the feature is a rock formation, likely a lava dome shaped into an isolated mesa, similar in height to the \"Face.\" The article also mentions this geological explanation.\n\nTherefore, the prevailing evidence supports the conclusion that the \"Face on Mars\" is a natural phenomenon. The improved clarity of recent photographs significantly strengthens the case against artificial construction, confirming its identity as a geological formation."}
{"text": "Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted communication has emerged as a promising technology to meet the increasing demand for high spectral and energy efficiency in future wireless systems.  Comprising cost-effective, passive, and programmable elements, IRSs can intelligently manipulate wireless propagation environments, tailoring signal paths between communication nodes [1]–[6]. This allows for directing transmitted signal energy via beamforming, leading to significant power savings.  Furthermore, IRSs, typically fabricated as thin rectangular planes, can be easily integrated into existing infrastructure by attaching them to building facades, indoor ceilings, and vehicles [6], [7].  Driven by these advantages, research has explored IRS applications for enhancing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission [8], physical layer security [9], and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) [10].\n\nTo fully realize the potential of IRSs, careful design of both the IRS phase shift configuration and the base station (BS) transmit beamforming is crucial [4], [6], [10], [11].  Several studies have investigated joint BS beamforming and IRS reflection coefficient design to minimize total transmit power while guaranteeing user quality-of-service (QoS).  Assuming perfect channel state information (CSI), transmit power minimization problems have been explored for various IRS-assisted wireless systems, including multiuser MIMO systems [2], secure wireless systems [11], and SWIPT systems [10]. However, the significant power savings reported in [2], [10], and [11] rely on the assumption of continuous IRS phase shifts, which is impractical.  Due to challenges such as high energy consumption, integration complexity, and component coupling, practical IRS elements typically employ discrete, low-resolution phase shifters, often 1-bit (on-off) or 2-bit (quadruple-level) [4], [6], [12].\n\nConsequently, research has begun investigating resource allocation with discrete IRS phase shifts.  For example, [12] proposed a suboptimal alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm to promote user fairness in multiuser systems.  However, as shown in [8] and [11], AO-based algorithms for these non-convex optimization problems compromise optimality, often converging to local optima and exhibiting performance dependence on initial points [8], [11], [13].  To explore optimal performance, [4] considered a single-user scenario, determining the optimal BS beamformer and discrete IRS phase shifts using enumeration. This approach, however, is difficult to extend to multiuser systems due to the complexity of finding closed-form optimal beamforming vectors.  Furthermore, assuming perfect CSI, the conference version of this paper [1] presented a generalized Benders decomposition (GBD)-based algorithm for a simplified multiuser system without a direct BS-user link.  However, optimal design for IRS-assisted multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems with a direct link and imperfect CSI remains an open problem.\n\nWhile [1] and [4] assume perfect CSI, acquiring accurate CSI in passive IRS systems is challenging.  Conventional channel estimation methods struggle with IRS-assisted links, leading to inevitable channel estimation errors and imperfect CSI [7], [9].  Furthermore, BS-IRS and IRS-user channels are typically cascaded for end-to-end estimation, requiring joint consideration of their CSI and estimation errors [7], [14]. Consequently, robust designs for imperfect CSI have been studied.  For instance, [7] and [14] employed worst-case robust optimization methods based on linear approximation and successive convex approximation (SCA), respectively, assuming continuous phase shifts.  However, even with this optimistic assumption, global optimality is not guaranteed.  A globally optimal robust resource allocation framework for practical IRS systems with imperfect CSI and discrete phase shifters is still lacking.\n\nMotivated by this, we investigate, for the first time, globally optimal joint BS beamforming and IRS phase shift design for multiuser IRS-assisted systems with discrete phase shifters. Our contributions are:\n\n* We study resource allocation in IRS-assisted systems with discrete phase shifters, minimizing BS transmit power while guaranteeing minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for each user. We develop optimal and suboptimal strategies for both perfect and imperfect CSI.\n* For perfect CSI, we formulate the joint design problem as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and propose transformations enabling a GBD-based iterative algorithm that guarantees convergence to the globally optimal solution. This algorithm provides a performance benchmark for suboptimal designs [4], [12].  We also develop a computationally efficient suboptimal SCA-based scheme.\n* We extend our framework to imperfect CSI, recasting robust SINR constraints as linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints and formulating a robust MINLP problem."}

His days started early: measuring, making lists of materials, trips to the lumber yard. People were either politely oblivious to the fact that Captain America was buying lumber and renting equipment, or they genuinely didn't recognize him.  Either way, he appreciated the anonymity.  The work was easy. Decades spent honing his superhuman body for battle translated surprisingly well to demolition and rebuilding.  He found himself reflecting on years past, a flicker of longing for Tony already surfacing.\n\nA knock broke his reverie.  He opened the door, jeans and shirt smeared with grime, wiping his hands on a rag. \"Hello there, we're your neighbors. I'm Liz Lee, and this is my son Nathan.\" Liz, in her late twenties or early thirties, smiled.  Nathan, about seven, held up a bowl, his words tumbling out in an excited rush. \"We brought you fruit, bread, and some snacks!\"  Steve, cleaning his hand, shook Liz's hand and bent down to Nathan. \"Well, that was mighty nice of you and your mother to bring me some food, Nathan.\"\n\nBefore Steve could say more, Nathan blurted, \"ARE YOU CAPTAIN AMERICA?\"  Steve laughed, while Liz admonished, \"Nathan Lee, what did I say about that!\"  Steve reassured her, \"No, that's okay, Mrs. Lee—Liz.” He corrected himself, meeting Nathan’s awestruck gaze. \"To answer your question, Nathan, no. Sorry, buddy. I'm not Captain America.\" Nathan's face fell, but then Steve winked. \"I *used* to be Captain America. I'm retired now.\" The boy's face lit up again.  Turning back to Liz, Steve continued, \"But please, I'm done with that. I'm just here to fix up this place and be part of the community. Just call me Steve.\"\n\n“Welcome to the neighborhood, Steve. Let us know if you need anything,” Liz offered warmly.  \"Thank you, Liz, I will. And thank you again, Nathan, for the food.\" Nathan, speechless, was nudged by his mother.  \"Oh, you're welcome.\"  \"Nice to meet you, Steve,\" Liz said, taking Nathan's hand."}

{"text": "The distribution shift between training and testing data, known as domain shift, poses a significant challenge in real-world applications. Domain generalization attempts to mitigate this by learning a universal model from available source datasets without access to the target data (Ghifary et al., 2016; Motiian et al., 2017).  Existing methods predominantly focus on learning domain-invariant representations across source domains (Muandet et al., 2013; Ghifary et al., 2015; Motiian et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018a; b). However, these approaches can falter in complex scenarios.\n\nConsider the data model Y → X defined on X × Y.  Given a class label Y, feature X is generated by conditional distributions D<sub>y</sub>(X) = P<sub>D</sub>(X|Y = y), where D represents either a source domain (S<sub>m</sub>, m = 1, . . . , M) or the target domain T.  Most domain generalization methods assume that for a fixed y ∈ Y, the target domain's class-conditional distribution T(X|Y = y) is closer to at least one source class-conditional S<sub>m</sub>(X|Y = y) than to any distribution of a different class (Figure 1 Left). In such ideal cases, even simple k-NN methods can perform well.  However, performance degrades when the variation among class-conditionals of the same class is substantial, meaning the closest conditional distribution to T(X|Y = y) is S(X|Y = y') where y' ≠ y (Figure 1 Right) (Krueger et al., 2020).\n\nThis work proposes a class-conditioned domain generalization method inspired by distributional robust optimization (Kuhn et al., 2019).  This approach optimizes the worst-case performance over a set of distributions—the uncertainty set—centered around observed reference distributions. We assume that class-conditionals of different domains form class-specific uncertainty sets, aiming to learn a universally robust classifier that remains discriminative even under the worst-case distributions within these sets.\n\nA key challenge lies in defining a robust and computable uncertainty set.  Gao et al. (2018) addressed this for a single source domain using the Wasserstein distance, formulating the robust optimization problem as a solvable convex optimization problem.  However, the choice of parameters in Gao et al. (2018) significantly impacts generalization performance.  Our method leverages the Wasserstein barycenter as the reference distribution and employs an iterative algorithm to automatically learn the optimal radius.\n\n\n## 2 BACKGROUND\n\nGao et al. (2018) formulated robust hypothesis testing as a minimax problem considering distributional uncertainty. Given two sets of distributions over X, *P*<sub>1</sub> and *P*<sub>2</sub>, the goal is to find distributions P<sub>1</sub> ∈ *P*<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub> ∈ *P*<sub>2</sub> and a detector φ that minimizes the maximum of type I and type II errors:\n\nEQUATION (1)\n\nThis work uses the Wasserstein distance to construct uncertainty balls of radius θ<sub>k</sub> centered around empirical distribution Q<sub>k</sub>:"}

Held last Friday at the Ashanti Regional Coordinating Council (RCC), the event attracted numerous dignitaries, all adhering to a strict dress code.\n\nThe banquet was punctuated by memorable moments, including a dance between Otumfuo and First Lady Rebecca Akufo-Addo, which drew enthusiastic applause.  Nearby, President Akufo-Addo danced with Lady Julia Osei Tutu, the wife of the Asantehene. Former First Lady Nana Konadu Agyeman Rawlings also graced the dance floor, showcasing her impressive footwork.  Highlife legend Abrante Amakye Dede captivated the audience with a stellar performance.\n\nIn a brief speech, President Akufo-Addo eulogized Otumfuo, highlighting his contributions to Ghana's political and socio-economic growth.  Describing the Asantehene as a good friend of 40 years, the President lauded Otumfuo's instrumental role in resolving the Dagbon chieftaincy dispute. He praised his work as chairperson of the Committee of Eminent Chiefs, alongside Nayiri, the Overlord of Mamprugu, and Yogbonwura, the Overlord of the Gonja state, in achieving a lasting peace.  The President further commended Otumfuo's achievements in education through the Otumfuo Education Fund, his efforts in combating HIV/AIDS, and his revitalization of the institution of chieftaincy.  President Akufo-Addo then proposed a toast to Otumfuo’s long life and good health.\n\nOtumfuo, in his response, acknowledged his long-standing relationship with President Akufo-Addo, who previously served as his personal lawyer. He expressed his appreciation for the state banquet and affirmed Asanteman's continued commitment to national transformation.  Pledging his collaboration with the President for the development of the country, particularly within his kingdom, Otumfuo painted a poignant picture of the challenges facing the Ashanti Region: \"You walk alone on this path and you are struck by the picture of an old lady in the twilight of her years in decline of seeming neglect and a picture of despair. Sadly this picture is not exclusive but a reflection of the challenges confronting the people in the Ashanti Region.” He then challenged the President and the nation: “Mr. President this is a challenge we must face together. A challenge we must overcome."}

{"text": "A strange sense of familiarity washed over me as the boy sat on my knee. I couldn't quite place him. He glanced back at his parents, then grinned at me, scooting closer and tilting his head up. \"Kill the reindeer,\" he said.\n\nI recoiled in surprise. \"Excuse me? Do you even know what you're saying?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI wrestled with the notion that this child must have had a traumatic experience. Perhaps a video game had warped his perception.  But he seemed so young.  I couldn't grasp the situation.  \"Kill the reindeer, Santa.\"\n\nMy eyes darted from his small face to his parents. They stood waiting patiently with a dog and two teenagers, seemingly oblivious to their son's unsettling words. Only the cameraman seemed to register my shock, probably misinterpreting it as a reaction to some innocent childhood prattle.\n\n\"What's your name, son?\"\n\nHe stared at me, his initial confusion giving way to a dawning realization that I wasn't the genuine article. I could see the wheels turning in his head.  The way he reacted was bizarre, reinforcing the nagging feeling that I'd encountered him before and that he was older than he appeared.\n\n\"Who are *you*?\"  His confusion morphed into indignation, then disgust.  He reached into his back pocket, producing a small device I couldn't identify.  Suddenly, he pushed against my chest, attempting to jump down.\n\n\"NO!\" His mother, a blur of red-orange hair, rushed forward to lift him from my lap.  As I tumbled from the throne-like chair, I saw the father’s green pants moving toward us. A sharp pain pierced my chest.  Dizziness washed over me. The boy had stabbed me with the device. *How?*\n\n\"Sorry, Santa. If that *is* your real name…\" The father glared, his expression hinting at a perverse hope that I *was* the real Santa. The situation spiraled further into the surreal. The teenage boy in the blue shirt cried, \"SANTA, SANTA, no!\" The teenage girl simply stood there, her face… unsettling.\n\nThen it hit me. This was the family from the news report the other night. The one involved in the bizarre incident that destroyed a neighbor's bathroom. The newsman had ridiculed the story: the father in the green pants had apparently purchased a tank and fired it at the house across the street, obliterating the upstairs bathroom and killing the man inside. And now, their son had stabbed *me*. What in the world was going on?\n\nAs the mother lifted the boy and I struggled to regain my footing, he whispered, \"...curse this housewife harlot.\" The dog bounded forward, the boy grabbing for its leash as his mother set him down.  They turned, rejoined the teenagers, and left. I was dumbfounded, bleeding, but overwhelmingly relieved to see them go."}

{"text": "Driverless cars represent a significant technological advancement with the potential for great utility. However, their reliability remains a concern.  I personally distrust these vehicles and wouldn't want to own one, primarily due to safety concerns, especially the risk of collisions.\n\nMy biggest reservation stems from the ambiguity surrounding liability.  Consider a scenario where, while in a driverless car, another driver runs a red light, causing a head-on collision because the autonomous vehicle couldn't react as quickly as a human.  Who would be at fault?  The driver of the other car, the manufacturer of the driverless car, or myself?  As mentioned, new traffic laws will undoubtedly be required to address these complex situations.  The limited acceptance of semi-autonomous vehicles in only three out of fifty states underscores the widespread public distrust. If manufacturers intend to release these cars by 2020, legal frameworks must be in place to protect both drivers and companies.\n\nFurthermore, I doubt driverless cars can ever achieve the same level of awareness as human drivers.  In a crash, the car itself doesn't face the same inherent self-preservation instincts a human driver possesses.\n\nIn my opinion, the release of driverless cars in the United States should be prohibited until these issues are resolved. Perhaps a trial period in other countries could provide valuable data and inform necessary adjustments to our liability laws before their introduction here.  Currently, our legal system isn't equipped to handle the complexities driverless cars introduce."}

{"text": "Previous work on adapting moving frames to numerically solve PDEs on curved surfaces, including conservation laws [1], the diffusion equation [2], shallow water equations [3], and Maxwell's equations [4], has typically assigned random directions to moving frames within the tangent plane when anisotropy is absent.  Since the first moving frame, denoted as *e*₁ , must be differentiable within each element, its direction cannot be entirely independent of neighboring frames to ensure this differentiability.  While local frame directions are linked, their average orientation remains random.  Following Cartan's original definitions [5], we refer to this distribution as zeroth-order moving frames. In this case, the moving frames simply constitute an orthonormal local reference frame reflecting the tangent plane's geometry.\n\nFirst-order moving frames arise naturally by aligning *e*₁ with the tangent vector along a wave's trajectory.  For instance, in Maxwell's equations, *e*₁ aligns with the electric or magnetic field, while in the diffusion-reaction equation, it aligns with the gradient of the variable representing electric potential or material concentration. Second- and third-order moving frames are obtained by further aligning *e*₂ and *e*₃ with the binormal and normal directions, respectively.  In many scenarios, first-order moving frames inherently satisfy the conditions for second- and third-order frames. Consequently, we can collectively refer to these non-zeroth-order moving frames as Darboux frames [6]."}

{"text": "The problem with driverless cars raises several safety concerns. What happens if the system fails and the occupant doesn't know how to drive?  What if a malfunction occurs, or the car breaks down and the person inside can't fix it?\n\nConsider this: You're alone in a driverless car, traveling through a remote area, when the system suddenly stops working.  If you don't know how to drive, you're stranded.  Or, imagine navigating heavy traffic when the car unexpectedly ceases autonomous operation.  If you can't take control, a serious accident could occur.\n\nMalfunctions present another set of dangers.  Suppose you're driving in a city and the car fails to stop at a red light.  This could result in a collision, injuries, or even fatalities. The car could also veer off the road or crash into a building.  Similarly, a sudden, uncontrolled acceleration or deceleration could have devastating consequences.\n\nBreakdowns in driverless cars pose unique challenges.  Imagine your car breaks down on a deserted back road.  Without mechanical knowledge, your options are limited: abandon the vehicle, call for help, or attempt to diagnose the problem yourself.  Even in heavy traffic, a malfunction can lead to accidents and potentially fatal outcomes.\n\nThese are just a few potential problems associated with driverless cars. While the technology holds promise, it's crucial to address these safety concerns before widespread adoption.  Hopefully, manufacturers can mitigate these risks to ensure the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles."}

{"text": "The author of \"The Challenges of Exploring Venus\" strongly advocates for further study and potential human exploration of Venus, despite the planet's hostile environment.  While acknowledging the significant dangers, the author emphasizes the scientific value of such a mission. This argument is built on several key points.\n\nFirst, the author highlights Venus's potential history.  As Earth's closest planetary neighbor and most similar in size and structure, Venus may once have harbored oceans and even life. This tantalizing possibility, along with present-day features like valleys, mountains, and craters – reminiscent of Earth's terrain – makes a compelling case for further investigation, as explicitly stated by the author: \"The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making a mission both safe and scientifically productive.\" This sentence clearly signals the author's desire to find solutions to the challenges of Venusian exploration.\n\nHowever, the author also frankly addresses the stark differences between Earth and its \"twin.\"  Venus's thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere, sulfuric acid clouds, and scorching 800-degree Fahrenheit surface temperature create extremely inhospitable conditions for human life.  Despite these challenges, the author points out that NASA is actively pursuing solutions to enable both safe and productive missions.\n\nOne proposed solution involves deploying a blimp-like vehicle to hover approximately 30 miles above the Venusian surface. This altitude would offer some protection from the extreme surface temperatures and allow for observation and data collection above the turbulent lower atmosphere. While the high-altitude environment would still be challenging, the author notes that the temperature and air pressure at this height would be potentially survivable for humans, albeit far from ideal.\n\nBy presenting both the enticing possibilities and the daunting realities of Venusian exploration, the author effectively argues for continued research and development."}
{"text": "Thomas Huang's newly developed computer software can detect emotions simply by scanning a person's face.  While many people mask their emotions daily, this software can recognize even the slightest hint of discomfort or anguish. This innovation holds significant potential for the classroom.\n\nFor years, students have struggled with confusion in the classroom, often too intimidated to ask clarifying questions.  This software can identify student confusion, facilitating a more effective learning experience.  Furthermore, it can detect boredom and adjust the lesson accordingly, making it more engaging.\n\nDespite its groundbreaking potential, this software may also have drawbacks.  For example, teachers and professors could potentially face job displacement if students no longer need to ask questions. Schools might replace educators with computers equipped with this software, decreasing the demand for teachers. While this scenario may not be imminent, it raises valid concerns that warrant discussion.\n\nHowever, the benefits of this innovation are compelling. Increased utilization could lead to more engaging and effective learning experiences, eliminating student confusion and boredom.  Its applications extend beyond the classroom, with the potential to personalize advertisements and enhance video games and other media.  For these reasons, the software deserves serious consideration.\n\nIn conclusion, this new emotion-recognition software offers valuable applications both in professional settings and at home.  This technological advancement could even unlock a deeper understanding of human emotions, opening up new avenues for exploration."}
{"text": "Twenty-five years before May 24, 2001, a peculiar event captured public attention on Mars.  In 1976, the Viking 1 spacecraft, while orbiting Mars and scouting landing sites for its sister ship, Viking 2, captured an image of what appeared to be a shadowy, human-like face on the surface.  This image, taken in the Cydonia region, sparked considerable speculation.\n\nOn April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor, equipped with the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) operated by Michael Malin and his team, finally had its first opportunity to revisit Cydonia. The MOC captured images ten times sharper than the original Viking photograph. Based on this significantly improved imagery, the team concluded that the \"face\" was not an alien monument.\n\nThe Mars Global Surveyor made an even closer pass on April 8, 2001.  \"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the 'Face' in the field of view,\" explained  Garvin, a project scientist. Malin's team acquired an exceptionally detailed image of the formation using the camera's maximum resolution.\n\nThe 2001 image achieved a resolution of 1.5 meters per pixel, a dramatic improvement over the 43 meters per pixel resolution of the 1976 Viking image.\n\nAfter extensive analysis of the higher-resolution images, scientists determined that the feature is a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, landforms common in the American West."}
{"text": "The prospect of self-driving cars, like those being developed by Google, raises significant questions about the future of driving.  While reaching the age of 16 traditionally grants driving privileges, the development of autonomous vehicles may soon make a driver's license obsolete.  However, I believe the potential drawbacks of these vehicles outweigh their benefits.  From safety concerns to legal ambiguities, the risks associated with self-driving cars present a compelling argument against their widespread adoption.\n\nThe article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" highlights both the positive and negative aspects of autonomous vehicles.  While acknowledging potential advantages, I believe the negative aspects are far more critical. The article rightly questions liability in the event of an accident caused by a technological failure: \"If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault—the driver or manufacturer?\" This question underscores the inherent risks associated with relying on complex technology. The article also points out the current legal landscape: \"traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars.\"  This demonstrates widespread concern about the safety of autonomous vehicles.\n\nWhile proponents might argue that removing human error from the equation will reduce accidents, technology introduces its own set of risks. The rise in accidents due to distracted driving illustrates the dangers of human error, but transferring control to technology doesn't eliminate the possibility of failure.  2015 saw a surge in car crashes, largely attributed to texting and driving.  Eliminating human drivers wouldn't necessarily solve the problem; rather, it would shift the potential for error to glitches, hacking, and even theft. These technological vulnerabilities could lead to new forms of danger, potentially facilitating criminal activity and creating unforeseen avenues for destruction.\n\nIn conclusion, the development of self-driving cars presents more dangers than advantages. Although they may appear more sophisticated and potentially efficient, the risks of accidents, technological failures, and malicious exploitation are too significant to ignore. While Google and other companies continue to develop this technology, so too will those who seek to exploit its vulnerabilities."}

Articles often feature smiling family photos and headlines painting him as a devoted family man, a stark contrast to the horrific crimes he is charged with. This portrayal is problematic, to say the least.\n\nWatts, 33, allegedly murdered his 15-weeks-pregnant wife, Shanann, and their daughters, 4-year-old Bella and 3-year-old Celeste, while reportedly having an affair with a co-worker. Yet, his mugshot is rarely the featured image. Instead, media outlets often use photos from Shanann's Facebook account, seemingly capitalizing on the relatable image of a happy family to attract clicks.  Is this an attempt to draw readers in by playing on the dissonance between the image and the horrific reality?\n\nThis preferential treatment is even more unsettling when compared to media portrayals of other cases, as Shaun King highlighted.  He pointed out the lack of humanizing coverage given to a father who sought vigilante justice for his daughter, a rape victim, compared to the sympathetic portrayal sometimes afforded to Watts.  This disparity raises serious questions about the influence of \"white privilege\" in media narratives.\n\nWe are not alone in our concern.  A quick search online reveals widespread criticism of this biased portrayal.  We must call for change and hold the media accountable. When we see this type of inequitable representation, we need to point it out and demand better.  Using a smiling family photo and quotes from acquaintances describing Watts as a devoted father, like those featured in a recent People Magazine article,  only serves to obscure the horrific nature of his alleged crimes.  Quotes like, “It’s beyond belief, really… I never saw this coming,” from Kris Landon, further perpetuate this misleading image."}
{"text": "In the town of Yardel, during the 27th year of King Ionil II's glorious reign, stood a tall tower shrouded in secrets.  Etched above its entrance, in the script of the Elder Tongue, were the words \"Scholar's Stone.\" Within resided two men. One was known as Ynvarg, though none believed this ancient name, a relic of the era when wild magic was tamed and bound to human will, was truly his birth name.  Ancient Ynvarg suffered frequent, racking coughs that left him weakened and in pain, yet he possessed profound wisdom and spoke the Elder Tongue as fluently as his native language.\n\nThe other, a sixteen-year-old bastard boy named Ulthir, served as Ynvarg's apprentice, learning the intricacies of magic and its command through the Elder Tongue. One day, the youth approached his master. \"Ynvarg,\" he asked, \"are you my father?\"  A subtle smile touched Ynvarg’s lips.  \"And what makes you think so, young one?\"\n\n\"My father vanished during the Destruction of Morgshold,\" Ulthir explained, \"but I always sensed he lived.  I feel drawn to you, a familiarity, and we share a similar look. Yet, that wasn't enough to raise suspicion. There's more. My mother never revealed my father's name, but I found it in old letters: Vayar.  And what name did the wild witch use when she bound you with your true name? Vayar.  Then there's this.\"  Ulthir produced two deep red stones and touched them together. They glowed with an unnatural light. \"Blood stones. Made from our blood. They glow when touched by kin.\"\n\n\"I hope you didn't pilfer my essence while I slept.  I need every drop of red life I can get,\" Ynvarg quipped.\n\n\"Of course not,\" Ulthir retorted. \"I took it when I cleaned up after your little mishap with the summoned imp.  We share blood, and you share my father's name. So please, just tell me. Are you my father?\" Tears welled in the boy's eyes as he pleaded for honesty and connection.  Ynvarg’s expression became strained, as if suppressing laughter during a solemn rite.\n\n\"My boy, I can offer little.  But I have two pieces of advice.  First, when you yearn for a home, you shall find it on the banks of the River Eidir."}

{"text": "The question of whether randomized algorithms offer a fundamental advantage over deterministic ones is a central problem in computer science, encapsulated by the unresolved conjecture P = BPP.  P represents problems solvable deterministically in polynomial time, while BPP encompasses problems solvable by randomized algorithms in polynomial time with bounded error probability.  The prevailing belief is that P = RP = CoRP = BPP, suggesting randomness offers no significant advantage. This belief stems from deep connections between complexity theory, circuit lower bounds, and pseudorandom generators.\n\nWhile a direct proof of P = BPP remains elusive, a more manageable approach is to focus on specific problems with known randomized but unknown deterministic polynomial-time algorithms.  One such problem is the Exact Matching problem (Em), introduced by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis in 1982.  Em asks whether, given a graph with red and blue edges and an integer k, a perfect matching exists with exactly k red edges.  Mulmuley et al. demonstrated a randomized polynomial-time solution in 1987, yet a deterministic counterpart remains undiscovered.  Each \"derandomization\" of a randomized algorithm provides further evidence towards the validity of P = BPP.  A prominent example is the deterministic primality testing algorithm developed by Agrawal, Kayal, and Saxena in 2002.\n\nInterestingly, Em is connected to another problem in BPP lacking a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm: Polynomial Identity Testing (Pit).  Pit determines if a given polynomial, represented by an algebraic circuit, is identically zero.  The Schwartz-Zippel Lemma places Pit within CoRP, implying a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm should exist if CoRP = P. However, Kabanets and Impagliazzo suggest derandomizing Pit is difficult, potentially requiring breakthroughs in proving circuit lower bounds.  Existing randomized algorithms for Em utilize Pit as a subroutine or employ the Isolation Lemma, both placing Em within RP.\n\nEm has seen deterministic polynomial-time solutions on specific graph classes, including bounded tree-width graphs, K3,3-minor free graphs, and graphs of bounded genus, often employing Pfaffian orientations.  Approximation results also exist, such as Yuster's deterministic algorithm for finding almost exact matchings in YES-instances.\n\nDespite the lack of a complete derandomization, Em remains relevant.  Over the past decade, it has appeared in various contexts, including budgeted, color-bounded, and constrained matching; multicriteria optimization; matroid intersection; binary linear equation systems; recoverable robust assignment; and planarizing gadgets for perfect matchings.  A full derandomization of Em would often derandomize related results in these areas.  Its inclusion as an open problem in influential work on the parallel computation complexity of the matching problem has further contributed to its continued relevance.  This sustained interest underscores the importance of Em within theoretical computer science and the ongoing pursuit of a deterministic solution."}
{"text": "Driverless cars are rapidly approaching reality, as detailed in \"Driverless Cars Are Coming.\"  However, I remain unconvinced that they are ready for widespread adoption. While the technology holds promise, significant safety concerns must be addressed before these vehicles can safely navigate our roads.\n\nThe article proposes two primary approaches to driverless navigation: \"smart roads\" and sensor-equipped vehicles.  The \"smart roads\" concept, involving embedding electrical cables or magnets in the road, as explored by General Motors and Berkeley engineers, presents logistical and financial obstacles.  Rebuilding every road globally is simply impractical. Furthermore, this approach fails to address how these vehicles would operate on roads lacking these modifications.\n\nThe alternative involves equipping cars with sensors, lasers, and receivers, as demonstrated by the Toyota Prius.  While seemingly more feasible, this approach relies heavily on artificial intelligence.  The critical question remains: can AI match human intelligence and reaction time in complex situations?  Can it respond effectively to unexpected events like a deer crossing the road, a cyclist, a child's ball, or even a pothole?  These scenarios demand split-second decisions that current AI may struggle to handle.\n\nEven with a human driver present, as the article suggests, the potential for distraction remains a significant concern.  Buzzing or flashing lights intended to alert the driver to potential hazards could easily be ignored or, worse, exacerbate panic and hinder effective response.  Over-reliance on automation could lead to driver inattention, negating the supposed safety benefits.\n\nThe article positions driverless cars as a solution for preventing drunk driving. However, this argument overlooks a crucial point: impaired \"drivers\" are incapable of taking control in emergencies.  The distractions presented by the car's systems would further hinder their ability to react, potentially turning a supposedly safe option into a dangerous one.  Traditional alternatives like taxis or designated drivers offer more reliable safeguards.\n\nUltimately, the current state of driverless car technology presents more risks than benefits.  While the technology holds long-term potential, relying solely on artificial intelligence and sensors is premature.  Too many unpredictable scenarios could compromise the safety of both passengers and pedestrians."}

{"text": "It had been a long time since Chris had written anything, but he pressed on, hoping for the best.  He knew his tenses might be a bit off, but this was just a quick account. He needed to get this story down.\n\nChris knew he had to do something for Moe.  They'd been inseparable since grade school, weathering life's ups and downs together. Girls had come and gone for both of them, but this time was different.  This one had shattered Moe. After three and a half years, Lindsey had thrown it all away in a single, stupid night.  Moe wasn't the type to get angry or vengeful.  He hadn't yelled, hadn't even raised his voice. Kind, emotional, and forgiving, Moe had poured his heart into making the relationship work.  But ultimately, he couldn't live with the betrayal.  He still loved her, even now, but the *in* love was gone. That was the part that truly broke him. The hurt, the betrayal, the indelible images of the woman he thought he'd spend his life with… those were the wounds that wouldn’t heal.\n\nSince ending things on Thursday – the day that marked both the end of the happiest period of his life and the beginning of his despair – Moe hadn't left his apartment. Chris wanted to give him space, but he also knew he was the only one who could pull Moe out of this abyss.  An invitation to a coworker's party seemed like the perfect opportunity.\n\nThat afternoon, Chris went to Moe’s apartment, unannounced.  He knocked, called out, hoping a familiar voice would offer some comfort.  Moe just told him to go away. Undeterred, Chris used his spare key and let himself in. He found Moe lying on the couch in his underwear, the stale air suggesting he’d been there for a while.  Immediately, Chris started barking orders.  \"Take a shower, get dressed, comb your hair,\" he demanded. \"I'm taking you to lunch, and we're going out tonight.\" Moe refused.  \"Dude, you have to leave this apartment sometime. My coworker, Dave, is having a party tonight, and we're going.  I already told him I'm bringing you.  He's excited to meet you.  There will be people, beer, and weed.\"  Moe still refused.  Chris tried a softer approach. \"At least clean yourself up and let me take you to lunch. You need to eat. We can talk.\"  Finally, Moe agreed.\n\nAt the corner pub, they ordered burgers and a bucket of beer. They avoided any mention of Lindsey or Moe’s heartbreak. After a few Coors, it felt like old times. They talked sports, video games, movies… Chris could see the tension easing in his friend.  He finally broached the subject of the party, and Moe accepted.  A quick stop at the liquor store, and they were on their way to Dave’s.  Arriving with a case of beer and a bottle of whiskey, they found the party already in full swing.  They navigated through the crowd, Moe recognizing a few familiar faces – inevitable in a small town.  Finally, they reached the kitchen where Dave was talking to some guests.  He spotted Chris and immediately broke off his conversation to greet them.\n\nAfter introductions and a few shots, the group dispersed to mingle.  Chris and Moe headed to the basement, where they ran into more of Chris’s coworkers. Chris noticed a girl, Abby, openly flirting with Moe, but Moe clearly wasn't ready. They moved to the other room, and then Moe stopped dead.  There, on the couch, looking utterly out of place, sat Lindsey, a red cup clutched in her hand, listening uncomfortably as her friends chatted."}

{"text": "The article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" promotes the idea of autonomous vehicles, but I believe human drivers should remain in control.  The current system has worked, so why abandon it?  Driverless cars present several significant problems.\n\nFirst, these vehicles lack the common sense of a human driver and cannot handle complex traffic situations. As mentioned earlier, a driverless car might not appropriately respond to unexpected roadwork or other hazards.  Imagine a driver falling asleep at the wheel, relying on the car's automation, only to be jolted awake by a collision caused by the car's inability to navigate the situation.  The driver would ultimately be responsible for any resulting injuries or fatalities.  What if the car encountered an accident scene?  It might not react appropriately and could even become part of the incident, again leaving the human \"driver\" liable.\n\nSecond, driverless cars rely on computers, which are inherently prone to malfunction.  Computers crash, require reboots, and sometimes simply stop working.  Just as a student might lose a school project due to a computer malfunction, a driverless car's systems could fail while on the road.  Picture this: the \"driver\" is asleep, relying on the automation, and the car's computer shuts down. The result could be a catastrophic accident.\n\nThese examples of driverless cars failing to handle complex traffic situations and the inherent risk of computer malfunction illustrate why this technology is not ready for public use."}

Hundreds of vehicles and thousands of troops are visible in the images, practicing formations in the facility.\n\nThese anniversaries are traditionally celebrated with large-scale military parades in Kim Il-sung Square, attended by thousands of citizens.  Dan Pinkston, a professor of international relations at Troy University's Seoul campus, explains, \"These anniversaries are very important to the leadership in Pyongyang. They celebrate with symbolism.\" He adds, \"We know they have been working on a lot of new weapons systems and upgrading others, including rocket artillery, unmanned aerial vehicles, and guided missiles. It will be a political decision on whether to put them on display at the parade, but it's what they have done in the past.”  For instance, a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) was showcased on a tractor-trailer launcher during the 2017 parade celebrating the birth anniversary of Kim Il-sung, the country's founder and grandfather of current leader Kim Jong-un.\n\nThe Stimson Center's analysis describes hundreds of vehicles parked near the training facilities and thousands of troops in formation.  Recent improvements at the Mirim training grounds include permanent garages replacing temporary tents, making it harder for satellite imagery to identify the equipment within.  However, tracks within the facilities confirm the presence of vehicles.\n\nRah Jong-yil, a former diplomat and senior intelligence official specializing in North Korea, believes it highly probable that new weaponry will be displayed.  He notes the international attention on the event, occurring shortly before the US presidential elections, provides a platform \"to send a series of messages.” He suggests the parade serves to project an image of military strength to the North Korean populace, despite recent crises, and to downplay the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which North Korea officially claims has not affected the country.\n\nThis upcoming parade is anticipated to be a significant display of North Korea's military capabilities and a platform for political messaging to both domestic and international audiences.

They reasoned that mathematics offered a universal language that wouldn't require the assistance of translation.\n\nInitial scans had revealed the Disc's physical properties: hundreds of rings, each etched with even more grooves.

Debemos permitirles incorporarse a los equipos de salud, donde su presencia es crucial, especialmente en estos momentos.\n\nSi los resultados de algunos aspirantes en las pruebas de idoneidad no son satisfactorios, la revisión debe centrarse en los currículos universitarios, el tipo de examen, o incluso la presión psicológica a la que se somete a estos jóvenes.  Después de años de estudio, es injusto que su futuro profesional dependa de un examen extracurricular. Todos los diplomas universitarios otorgan honores, derechos y privilegios al egresado, y estos no deberían estar condicionados a la decisión posterior de una organización.\n\nEl caso de los médicos ofrece un modelo alternativo: se incorporan al sistema de salud como médicos internos, continuando su formación durante dos años.

{"text": "(CNN) — Richard Browning is ready for takeoff. He ignites his engines, bends his knees, and ascends into the air.  Hovering, defying gravity, he begins to fly up and down an ordinary London street.\n\nThis isn't a scene from a superhero movie—it's Britain's real-life \"Iron Man\" in action. Browning has created a state-of-the-art flying suit that rivals anything on the silver screen.\n\nWant a piece of the action? Browning's jet suit is now officially on sale for £340,000 (roughly $442,396).\n\n**An Incredible Invention**\n\n[Insert image: Browning ascending outside UK department store Selfridges. Courtesy Selfridges]\n\nBuilt by Browning using 3D-printed parts, specialized electronics, and five jet engines, this incredible invention allows users, once they've mastered the basics, to soar at speeds of 32 miles per hour and reach altitudes of 12,000 feet.\n\n\"I get asked, 'Why?'\" Browning, a 39-year-old former oil trader in the City of London, tells CNN Travel. \"Fundamentally, I enjoy a challenge.\"\n\nThe inventor was inspired by his time as a reservist with the Royal Marines.  \"[In] that environment, you quickly learn you can push yourself quite far,\" says Browning. \"I wondered what would happen if you added flight horsepower to the human machine, which can adapt and coordinate so elegantly.\"\n\n[Insert image: Browning is the son of a maverick inventor. Courtesy Gravity]\n\n**Related content:** Personal flying machine designs revealed in Boeing GoFly contest\n\nBrowning is the son of a maverick inventor and aeronautical engineer. His paternal grandfather was an airline and wartime fighter pilot, and his maternal grandfather ran a British helicopter manufacturer.  The quest for flight, it seems, runs in the family.\n\n\"My family's background in industry suggests I've benefited from a sort of genetic, behavioral inheritance,\" Browning muses.\n\nStill, creating a flying suit was unprecedented. Browning explains the project began as a personal pursuit. \"This journey started as an exercise in proving something previously confined to superhero comic books was possible,\" he says. \"Now that we've done it, its capabilities are surprising us and, seemingly, large audiences around the world.\"\n\n**Related content:** These are the most popular private jet destinations\n\n**A Real-Life Superhero**\n\n[Insert image: Browning started inventing the suit during evenings and weekends, before it became his day job. Courtesy Gravity]\n\nBrowning began experimenting with the jet-powered flying suit discreetly, avoiding raising expectations. \"I started developing this novel form of human flight,\" he says. \"I honestly just did it alongside my day job, in evenings and weekends.\"\n\nAs the concept evolved, he shifted his focus. \"You only live once,\" he says, \"and I didn't want to regret not pursuing this.\"\n\nBrowning launched his flying company, Gravity, in Spring 2017, based in his Wiltshire home. The world took notice, and the epithet \"Wiltshire's Iron Man\" stuck. Wiltshire, a relatively quiet, rural county in Britain, is a surprising birthplace for a superhero flying suit.\n\n\"We didn't set out to build an Iron Man suit,\" clarifies Browning.  \"But the parallels became apparent early on.  The CGI team from the early Iron Man films actually reached out to us, excited to see how accurate their thinking had been.  It's a great connection, and I enjoy the comparison.\"\n\n\n**Buy One for Yourself**\n\n[Insert image: The suit is now on sale at UK department store Selfridges. Courtesy Gravity]\n\nWith the suit on sale, more people will see Browning fly—and perhaps try flying themselves. Gravity's team reports a high-profile, unnamed client has already purchased the first one.\n\nThe 1050bhp Jet Suit by Gravity is officially available at the upscale London department store, Selfridges. Even without the funds to buy one, you can see it up close and experience the effects in VR.\n\nBrowning outlines three levels of experience:\n\n[Insert image: Now you can try the flying suit for yourself.

{"text": "Modern cars have become significantly more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly.  Automotive technology continues to evolve rapidly, with self-driving capabilities now emerging. However, fully autonomous vehicles are not yet available to the public because the technology is still under development.  I believe driverless cars present safety concerns. Drivers may become less attentive and rely too heavily on the automation, potentially leading to accidents.\n\nThe article mentions that these vehicles are not entirely autonomous, as they struggle to navigate complex situations like construction zones and accidents. This requires drivers to remain alert. Consequently, the car isn't truly driverless, and if drivers become complacent and less defensive, accidents could occur.\n\nEmerging technologies can be unpredictable, and many advancements are kept from the public eye for safety and other reasons.  This is why self-driving cars are still undergoing rigorous testing.  It's questionable to label a car \"driverless\" when it still requires human intervention for steering and maneuvers like reversing out of driveways. While these vehicles aren't fully autonomous, developers are exploring innovative ways to maintain driver alertness.  For example, BMW's version of a \"driverless car\" currently only handles steering, acceleration, and braking.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) has integrated vibrating seats to alert drivers when they get too close to objects.  Although a fully autonomous vehicle remains elusive, significant progress has been made since the project's inception in 2009.\n\nSeveral states, including California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia, have restricted the use of driverless cars due to safety concerns.\n\nTesla projects a 2016 release of a car capable of autopilot functionality for 90% of driving time.  Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan also plan to introduce autonomous vehicles by 2020.\n\nThis new technology will undoubtedly be more expensive than existing technology due to its advanced features and higher value.\n\nThese vehicles require numerous sensors to function.  Google's modified Toyota Prius utilizes position estimation sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating roof sensor, a video camera near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor.  Crucially, a laser-based camera continuously generates a 3-D model of the car's surroundings. These vehicles utilize far more advanced technology than typical cars. This increased technological complexity directly correlates to a higher price.\n\nIn conclusion, these vehicles will be more expensive than current models.  The more technology incorporated, the higher the cost."}
{"text": "The last thing I remember was driving home from a club, buzzed.  My wife and I, empty nesters rattling around a too-quiet house, had decided to relive our youth, a disastrous decision that ended with both of us dead.  I know we’re dead.  The thought of the mess our children will have to deal with is agonizing. Thirteen days of fasting and rituals for our eldest son, who just landed a career-making case.  He’ll have to put everything on hold.  Our other two, a teacher pursuing her master's and our youngest, just deployed in the military, will have their lives disrupted too.  We raised them well. At least, I hope we raised them well enough to handle this.  It was only the first week after our youngest left… the house felt so empty.\n\nThen I woke up.  Here.  Wherever “here” is.  It's supposed to be heaven, I guess.  But if this is my reward, I’d rather be… well, anywhere else. Because I woke up next to Lakshmi.  Not my wife of 40 years, but Lakshmi.  The last time I saw her was at her engagement party, 43 years ago. We were high school sweethearts, a youthful, passionate fire that burned out by the end of college. We moved on, built separate lives, families. We were both happy.  So why, after 40 years of marriage to another woman, am I waking up next to *her*?\n\nIt's been three days.  Three days of silence.  She’s probably as bewildered as I am.  I’ll admit, she was the most passionate relationship of my life. But that was youth, hormones, a fleeting connection."}
{"text": "The use of technology to read students' emotional expressions in the classroom holds immense value for the future of education.  Currently, teachers often struggle to fully understand the fluctuating moods and emotions of their students, hindering the progress that depends on a strong teacher-student connection.  However, advancements in technology offer a potential solution.  Computer software can now analyze facial expressions and identify emotions, offering several key advantages.\n\nFirst, unlike human observers, computers don't experience fatigue.  As Professor Thomas Huang's emotion-recognition software demonstrates (D'alto, 1), this technology can continuously monitor and analyze emotional cues over extended periods, providing valuable insights that a human teacher might miss.  This constant monitoring allows for a more comprehensive understanding of student engagement and emotional responses throughout a lesson.\n\nSecond, emotion-recognition software can offer greater accuracy than human observation.  While we often rely on educated guesses to interpret others' emotions, this software provides more precise readings.  As described in \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the software tracks subtle facial movements and weighs different units to identify even mixed emotions (D'alto, 4). This level of precision allows for a more nuanced understanding of student reactions.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most significantly, this technology has the potential to adapt teaching methods in real-time.  By recognizing signs of confusion or boredom, the software can trigger modifications to the lesson, much like a skilled human instructor (D'alto, 6).  This dynamic approach to instruction can personalize learning and ensure that each student receives the support they need, when they need it.\n\nIn conclusion, the ability of emotion-recognition technology to operate continuously, provide accurate emotional readings, and adapt instructional strategies based on collected data makes it an invaluable tool for the classroom.  This technology has the potential to revolutionize learning by creating a more responsive and individualized educational experience for all students."}

{"text": "The article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" presents a compelling idea, but I argue against the development and use of driverless cars due to significant safety and cost concerns.  The potential for malfunction is a major deterrent.  What happens if a driverless car malfunctions while the driver is not paying attention?  Will the company take responsibility, replace the vehicle, or cover the costs associated with an accident?  This lack of clear accountability makes the prospect of owning a driverless car unsettling.  Furthermore, relying on technology that is inherently prone to malfunctioning, especially in a vehicle, is inherently risky.\n\nThe exorbitant cost of driverless cars further exacerbates the issue.  Ranging into the millions of dollars, these vehicles are financially inaccessible to the average person.  While the wealthy and famous may afford such a luxury, the vast majority will be priced out.  This creates a disparity where basic, reliable transportation remains affordable while advanced, autonomous vehicles are reserved for the elite.  Why invest in such expensive technology when reliable, albeit less technologically advanced, vehicles are readily available?\n\nProponents argue that driverless cars offer the convenience of hands-free driving. However, this argument is flawed.  Drivers are still required to monitor the vehicle and intervene when alerts arise.  The idea that someone could safely and responsibly use their phone while the car is in operation is ludicrous.  It promotes distracted driving and negates the supposed benefit of autonomous operation.  If one needs to be available by phone, it's far safer and more responsible to simply wait until arriving at one's destination.\n\nMoreover, the fundamental premise of a \"driverless\" car is undermined by the necessity of constant monitoring."}

I was looking for a long-term relationship, and the odds of finding one here were slim.\n\nI decided to humor him, though.  This was the fourth time he’d asked, and he *was* my best friend. I was very glad I did. She had a girl-next-door prettiness. She was by herself, which made approaching her easier. She wore glasses, suggesting she was either intelligent or wanted to appear so. Either way, it hinted at an appreciation for intellect, which was a plus. But what sealed the deal was the t-shirt from my blog’s store.\n\nMy blog wasn't successful and had only a handful of loyal followers. I'd only ever sold one t-shirt, and she was wearing it. I’d spent nights wondering who had deemed it worth fifteen dollars, and here was the answer: kind of cute, wearing glasses, and practically begging to be spoken to.\n\n“Be right back,” I told my friend. He patted me on the back and said, “Told you.” He knew about my blog and the t-shirt.\n\nI didn't have any go-to lines for bars, but I knew a lot about my own blog, so the opener was easy.\n\n“Age before video games?” I asked as I sat down. She laughed and nodded.\n\n“I can’t believe anyone else reads that blog!” she said, looking genuinely excited.\n\n“I know, right? There are, what, twenty-two followers?”\n\n“Twenty-three last time I checked,” she replied. “I got my friend hooked, too.”\n\n“So, tell me,” I said. “You like country dancing, flipping other people’s kayaks, putting stink bombs in geocaches, and sitting in the back at church so the priest doesn’t notice if you fall asleep?” She nodded at each activity.\n\n“I got most of those ideas from the blog, but yes to all.” Before I could continue, she interjected, “Hey, can I talk to you later? I set up this online date, and he should be here any minute.” I was a little disappointed by the dismissal, but she *had* made a point of inviting me to talk again.\n\n“Sure,” I said. “By the way, do you have a smartphone with internet access here? I know this place can be a bit of a dead zone.” She nodded and showed me her phone as proof.\n\n“Why?” she asked.\n\n“You’ll see,” I said, and went back to my friend."}
{"text": "Millions of images are taken daily and billions are hosted online thanks to the proliferation of digital cameras and storage. This massive volume of images presents a challenge: how can users effectively retrieve relevant images? This is the core problem of image retrieval.  While similar to document retrieval in user interaction (keywords in, results out), image retrieval is far more complex.  Unlike documents, machines cannot simply use string matching to connect textual queries with images.  Current image search engines rely primarily on surrounding text to represent image content, essentially treating image retrieval as document retrieval. This approach is inherently flawed, as surrounding text is often unavailable or irrelevant, leading to poor retrieval results.\n\nTo improve retrieval accuracy and make all images searchable, machines need to directly measure image-query similarity by extracting information from the images themselves.  This is a difficult task for two key reasons:  1) Extracting semantic information from images, even with state-of-the-art hand-crafted features like super-vector coding, Fisher vectors, and spatial pyramid matching, remains challenging. 2) The vast, potentially infinite, number of possible queries makes building query-specific classifiers impractical.\n\nRecent advancements in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) offer a promising solution. DNNs have demonstrated their ability to automatically learn representations from raw data like images and text, excelling in tasks like image classification and word embedding. Inspired by this success, we propose a unified DNN to model image-query similarity.  This DNN combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image representation and a Word Embedding Network (WEN) for query representation.  Both networks output vectors in the same space, allowing image-query similarity to be calculated as the inner product of these vectors. CNNs have proven superior to hand-crafted features in extracting semantic image information, while WENs effectively generate low-dimensional vector representations of words, with query representations modeled as linear combinations of these word vectors.  As illustrated in Figure 1, this unified DNN maps both images and queries into a common feature vector space.\n\nTraining this DNN requires a large dataset.  We utilize a large-scale clickthrough dataset from Bing image search, comprising 23 million clicked image-query pairs, 11.7 million queries, and 1 million images. This dataset’s breadth and depth provide excellent coverage of the sample space, mitigating overfitting even without techniques like dropout.\n\nQualitative results demonstrate that our learned model constructs a meaningful common vector space for images and queries. Quantitative results on an image retrieval task with 1000 queries, compared against competing methods, further demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II discusses related work. Section III introduces the unified DNN for joint image-query modeling and learning.  Section V presents experimental results on the large-scale clickthrough dataset.  Finally, Section VI concludes the work."}

Alors que les hétérosexuels ne sont jamais amenés à justifier de leur orientation sexuelle, les minorités sexuelles sont confrontées à un \"coming out\", une sortie du placard, si elles veulent vivre leur identité au grand jour.  Devoir annoncer son homosexualité est une épreuve qui peut intervenir à tout âge. Il n'y a pas d'âge pour faire son coming out. Si certains ressentent le besoin de le faire jeunes, d'autres, comme Guillaume, y sont confrontés bien plus tardivement.\n\nCet auditeur de France Bleu, père de trois enfants, était marié avec une femme lorsqu'il a fait face à son homosexualité à 34 ans.  Il retrace ici son parcours d'acceptation et d'annonce.\n\nAccepter son orientation sexuelle a été un long cheminement. \"Je ne l'acceptais pas, je n'en voulais pas et donc j'ai remis le couvercle sur la casserole\", témoigne-t-il, comparant ce rejet à un déni de grossesse : \"J'ai fait un peu comme un déni de grossesse : je ne voulais pas voir et je ne l'ai pas vu.\"  La situation \"devenue insupportable\", Guillaume a pris la décision, après avoir lui-même \"digéré tout cela\", d'en parler à sa famille. \"J'avais la chance d'être entouré par une famille super\", confie-t-il.

{"text": "The article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" explores both the promises and pitfalls of autonomous vehicles.  While driverless cars have been in development since at least 2009 and have logged hundreds of thousands of miles without incident, significant challenges remain.  One major concern is the cost of implementation and the question of liability in the event of an accident. Determining fault when a crash involves autonomous vehicles presents a complex legal challenge.  Furthermore, the expectation that drivers remain alert even in autonomous vehicles seems counterintuitive and potentially costly in terms of training and system design.\n\nMany drivers struggle to maintain focus on the road due to distractions like texting and phone calls.  Driverless cars offer the potential to mitigate these risks, but their capabilities are limited. While Google, for example, has been developing autonomous vehicles since 2009 that can operate under specific conditions, these systems are not yet foolproof.  These vehicles utilize sensors and sophisticated software to interpret their surroundings, much like the technology used in anti-lock brakes, which has advanced considerably over the past decade. Continued advancements in sensor technology, computer hardware, and software promise to make driving safer and potentially free up drivers' time for other activities.  Ideally, driverless cars would enhance the safety of drivers, passengers, and pedestrians.\n\nHowever, the financial burden of implementing widespread autonomous vehicle systems is substantial.  Upgrading existing infrastructure to support smart-road systems is a significant hurdle. The specialized sensors required for these vehicles are not readily available and come at a premium cost.  Maintaining driver alertness presents another challenge."}

{"text": "Matrix multiplication, a cornerstone of scientific computing, has been extensively studied for parallel implementation [3, 16, 48].  While leveraging commodity clusters or the cloud offers significant computational power, the inherent complexity of concurrency control and the network bottleneck, often exceeding single-node memory bandwidth limitations [12], pose significant challenges.  Efficiently balancing multicore parallelism with the constraints of data communication over the network is crucial for achieving high performance in these environments.\n\nIdeally, the underlying implementation should seamlessly handle this balancing act, shielding programmers from low-level parallelization details. This is particularly relevant for matrix-oriented languages like MATLAB, Octave, and Julia, which prioritize programmer productivity and abstraction over manual hardware-specific optimizations.  Our work focuses on automatically parallelizing matrix computations within Julia [8], a dynamic, high-performance language already featuring a robust explicit parallelism model.  We achieve this through lazy evaluation with hierarchical dependency analysis, online scheduling, and simulation, effectively minimizing the performance impact of network communication.\n\nThis paper contributes:\n\n• **The Julia Cloud Matrix Machine (Julia CMM):**  This extends the Julia language with implicitly-parallel matrix routines for cloud execution via an extension of the Julia matrix data type.\n\n• **An Online Simulation and Runtime System:** Employing offline profiling and regression analysis, this system predicts task execution times.  Combined with automated matrix parallelization and communicator configuration, it predicts the most efficient task schedule across a cluster and dynamically adjusts the optimal distribution of communication and computation processes per node.\n\n• **An Enhanced HEFT Scheduling Algorithm:**  This extension incorporates a node-level tile cache and dynamic tiling optimization to mitigate the network communication bottleneck.\n\n• **Extensive Experimental Evaluation:**  We validate our approach through rigorous testing on homogeneous and heterogeneous clusters within the AWS public cloud."}

Las remesas, con un crecimiento interanual del 27.6% en febrero de 2021, mantienen un flujo importante desde 2020.  Asimismo, las exportaciones se han visto favorecidas por un tipo de cambio real más alto, lo que aumenta su atractivo.\n\nEl Índice Mensual de Actividad Económica (IMAE) recuperó 28.7 puntos porcentuales al cierre de 2020, demostrando la rápida respuesta del país a las medidas implementadas por el Gobierno para contrarrestar los efectos de la pandemia.  Si bien el crecimiento interanual de enero de 2021 se ubicó en -1.8%, la recuperación continua de las ventas y la recaudación, impulsada por el sector industrial y de servicios, refleja la mejora de la actividad económica desde el segundo semestre de 2020.  La contracción mensual de las ventas del 19.6% en enero de 2021 se considera un comportamiento típico de ese mes.\n\nEl informe señala que la inflación interanual alcanzó un 7.1% en febrero, mientras que la subyacente se situó en 5.4%, debido principalmente al aumento del precio de las materias primas en el mercado internacional.  Por otro lado, desde junio de 2020 se observa una relativa estabilidad cambiaria, con una leve depreciación acumulada del 0.3% hasta febrero de 2021.  La apertura gradual de la economía, el incremento sostenido de los flujos de divisas y la participación del Banco Central de la República Dominicana (BCRD) en la Plataforma Electrónica de Negociación de Divisas han contribuido a disipar las presiones cambiarias.\n\nLas ayudas sociales han sido fundamentales para el sustento de millones de familias vulnerables.

The Countryside Alliance has issued wildfire prevention guidance as the country prepares for a gradual return to outdoor activities.\n\nStarting March 29th, outdoor gatherings of either six people or two households will be permitted, according to the government's roadmap. This relaxation of rules is expected to increase the number of people visiting the countryside to reunite with friends and family.  The Countryside Alliance emphasizes the importance of reminding these visitors about the dangers of wildfires and their role in prevention.\n\nWildfires can devastate farmland, wildlife, protected habitats, and the lives of people living and working in rural communities. The risk is particularly high in spring, when a combination of dead vegetation left over from winter, rising temperatures, and lower humidity can create ideal conditions for fires to ignite and spread rapidly.\n\nJust this week, firefighters spent two and a half hours tackling a blaze on Saddleworth Moor near Diggle. This follows two previous wildfires on the moor, the most recent in February 2019. That fire took ten days to control, requiring firefighters from seven counties and resulting in the destruction of approximately four square miles of moorland with considerable environmental damage.\n\nSarah Lee, Head of Policy for the Countryside Alliance, said: “As lockdown eases, we expect many people will return to the countryside and our precious moorlands.  There's a strong desire within the rural community for greater public awareness of both the dangers of wildfires and the preventative measures that can be taken.”\n\nShe emphasized the devastating impact of wildfires on farming, local communities, wildlife, protected habitats, and the environment. “Remaining vigilant, especially during dry weather, and raising awareness among those enjoying our beautiful countryside are key to reducing this risk,” Ms. Lee added.\n\n\n**Wildfire Prevention Guidance:**\n\nThe Countryside Alliance offers the following guidance to help prevent wildfires:\n\n* **Never discard cigarettes.**\n* **Never start fires or use BBQs,** as they are a frequent cause of wildfires.\n* **Dispose of all litter properly.**\n* **Do not release sky lanterns.** Once released, there is no control over where they land.\n* **If you encounter a wildfire you cannot safely control, move to a safe location upwind and immediately call 999,** providing an accurate location of the fire."}

A pesar de un inicio dubitativo, fue de menos a más,  consolidando su juego de fondo, con dejadas más precisas que las de su rival, y neutralizando el ímpetu de un Tsitsipas que llegaba a Barcelona tras conquistar el Masters 1000 de Montecarlo sin ceder un solo set, y liderando la clasificación de la temporada 2021.\n\nEl partido, de altísimo nivel, se extendió por más de tres horas.  Al final del segundo set, con 5-4 a su favor y tras un intercambio de roturas, Nadal dispuso de dos bolas de partido con el servicio de Tsitsipas. Sin embargo, el griego, con valentía y arriesgando, las salvó. Posteriormente,  remontó un 0-40 con su saque para ponerse 6-5, pero no logró quebrar a Nadal y la manga se decidió en el 'tie-break'.\n\nEn la muerte súbita, Tsitsipas cedió primero su servicio, pero Nadal encadenó dos errores y, a la tercera bola de set del heleno, éste igualó el marcador.  El español, tras tener la victoria a dos puntos, se veía obligado a disputar un tercer set.  Tsitsipas había logrado lo que solo David Ferrer, actual director del torneo, había conseguido antes: arrebatarle un set a Nadal en una final del Godó.\n\nEn el set decisivo, ambos jugadores mantuvieron sus servicios con firmeza.  En el quinto juego de Nadal, Tsitsipas dispuso de su primera bola de partido, pero el manacorí, agresivo en los momentos clave, la salvó con una inteligente subida a la red.  El griego, sin embargo, también demostró su garra, subiendo a la red con determinación y elevando el nivel de la final.\n\nCon 5-5, el 'tie-break' parecía inevitable.  Con Tsitsipas al servicio, Nadal dispuso de cuatro bolas de rotura. A la cuarta, el griego falló, dejando a Nadal servir para ganar el partido.  Tsitsipas pasó del 30-0 al 30-40, pero Nadal cortó su reacción.  En el 'deuce', llegó la tercera bola de partido para el español, y Tsitsipas volvió a fallar.  Nadal sellaba así su duodécimo triunfo en Barcelona.\n\nAl comienzo del encuentro, Tsitsipas se adelantó 2-4 tras romper el segundo servicio de Nadal. El manacorí, mejorando su saque progresivamente hasta el final del partido, igualó a 4 y, aprovechando la primera de sus dos bolas de set, se adjudicó la primera manga con una remontada cimentada en el esfuerzo y la determinación.\n\nEn la reedición de la final de 2018, donde Nadal superó a un jovencísimo Tsitsipas por un contundente 6-2 y 6-1 en su primer enfrentamiento, el español volvió a imponerse, haciendo valer su experiencia y su reinado en la tierra batida.

{"text": "Atlassian CISO Adrian Ludwig addressed the Atlassian Confluence vulnerability (CVE-2021-26084) with ZDNet this week, explaining the company's response.  Ludwig stated that Benny Jacob initially reported the vulnerability on June 30th through Atlassian's bug bounty program. The security team immediately recognized the critical nature of the issue, making a patch available by August 15th and issuing security bulletins on August 25th.\n\nAtlassian also submitted the vulnerability and patch information to NIST and other government organizations for broader dissemination.  This information was subsequently shared with Atlassian's channel partners and account managers to facilitate customer notification.\n\nAround September 1st, Atlassian detected evidence of automated exploitation attempts on its own Confluence test instances.  Ludwig explained that these were bots probing and attempting to leverage the vulnerability.  \"As part of our standard vulnerability evaluation process, we review logs across our environment and infrastructure for any historical exploitation,\" he said. \"In this case, we didn't see any exploitation before our security advisory, but we did observe it beginning around September 1st.\"\n\n\"On September 3rd, after confirming this activity and recognizing that many users had not yet patched, we updated our advisory to indicate active exploitation and strongly encourage patching,\" Ludwig added.  A second customer notification followed after security companies and government agencies, including US Cybercom, issued their own alerts.\n\nDespite these efforts, thousands of organizations remained vulnerable.  Security company Censys reported over 8,500 vulnerable Confluence instances as of September 5th.  Jenkins, a prominent open-source automation server, announced a successful attack on its deprecated Confluence service via the exploit on Saturday. By Wednesday evening, GreyNoise reported hundreds of organizations were still being targeted.\n\nGreyNoise CEO Andrew Morris noted a significant surge in attacks on Wednesday, with \"over a hundred devices opportunistically exploiting the vulnerability and counting.  If you haven't patched, you're owned.\"  Morris told ZDNet that GreyNoise, operating a vast network of sensor collectors, observed the first opportunistic exploitation at 4:45 pm on August 31st.\n\n\"We've seen a considerable ramp-up in the last few days, with over a hundred devices—144 to be precise—attempting exploitation just today,\" Morris said. \"This underscores the critical importance of patching for any Atlassian Confluence customers who haven't done so in the past week.  Even more crucial is likely contacting an incident response or network hunt team.  There's a very high probability—I'd say 99.999%—that unpatched Confluence instances have been compromised.\"\n\nBad Packets reported detecting CVE-2021-26084 exploit activity originating from hosts in Russia targeting their Atlassian Confluence honeypots. They previously reported \"mass scanning and exploit activity from hosts in Brazil, China, Hong Kong, Nepal, Romania, Russia, and the US.\"  Ludwig confirmed that all attacks observed within Atlassian's environment were automated and focused on cryptomining.\n\nMorris acknowledged the difficulty in attributing exploitation, as threat actors often commoditize access, selling access gained through new vulnerabilities.  \"It could be any combination of APTs, criminal groups, financially motivated actors, state-sponsored actors, or even individuals building botnets.  It's not entirely clear,\" he explained.  \"However, financially motivated actors are often involved, and cryptojacking is typically the quickest monetization route. In this case, I have no evidence suggesting what actions are being taken post-compromise.\"\n\nAddressing the challenges of updates, Ludwig described the vulnerability as a \"classic challenge for on-premise software.\"  Recalling his time at Adobe 20 years ago, he said, \"We implemented monthly security bulletins to drive update consistency, but even that wasn't enough for regular patching.\"  He noted the relative infrequency of Atlassian security advisories, which can make maintaining consistent patching practices more difficult.  Ludwig recommended that organizations with internet-facing services unable to update within 24-48 hours consider migrating to the cloud.\n\nLudwig stated that Atlassian doesn't know how many organizations remain unpatched or have utilized the provided script as an alternative to updating. He personally checked with customer support and noted lower than usual support volumes for a security incident.  \"It seems things are going relatively smoothly,\" Ludwig said.  \"The update appears to be working for those attempting it, and the script offers an easy way to ensure protection.\"  He added that Atlassian followed up with customers on Friday and provided additional information to field teams.\n\nWhile the full impact remains unclear, Ludwig acknowledged the persistent challenge of outdated software.  \"There will always be some number of outdated and exploited software instances on the internet,\" he explained.  \"Our goal is to do everything possible to ensure customers patch or apply the necessary scripts as quickly as possible.\"\n\nSeveral IT experts defended Atlassian's response, citing the inherent difficulty in prompting customer updates, especially around holiday weekends.  David McNeely, CTO of ThycoticCentrify, emphasized the time required and potential downtime associated with updates.  Morris echoed this sentiment, noting the commonality of such situations.  \"It's easy to criticize Atlassian, but this happens to almost every software company,\" Morris said. \"There's always a period after patch release where vendors urge immediate action, but they can't force it.\"  He added that the widespread impact and Labor Day weekend timing exacerbated this particular situation.  Morris concluded, \"Given Confluence's internet-facing nature and inherent vulnerability, patching and contacting an incident response team is highly recommended.\""}
{"text": "Persuasion, a pervasive element of human interaction, aims to alter beliefs, positions, or opinions.  Its mechanisms are extensively studied across the social sciences (Cialdini, 2001; Crano and Prislin, 2006; Keynes, 2010), informing strategies in diverse fields like public health (Farrelly et al., 2009; Pirkis et al., 2017; Young et al., 2018), marketing (Danciu, 2014; Funkhouser and Parker, 1999), and politics (Marková, 2008; Yu et al., 2019). The advent of social media has amplified these efforts through microtargeting—tailoring messages to specific individuals or groups (Kreuter et al., 1999; Teeny et al., 2020).  While proven effective (Ali et al., 2021; Latimer et al., 2005; Matz et al., 2017), microtargeting has faced scalability challenges due to the costs associated with individual profiling and message crafting.\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), Claude (Anthropic, 2023), and Gemini (Gemini Team, 2023) may overcome these limitations.  These models, trained on vast textual data, mimic human language and reasoning with remarkable fluency and versatility, often exhibiting superhuman performance in various tasks (Bubeck et al., 2023).  This power raises concerns about their potential for manipulation, misinformation, and exacerbating political polarization (Bontcheva et al., 2024; Burtell and Woodside, 2023; Hendrycks et al., 2023; Weidinger et al., 2022).  A key concern is the potential for cheap and easy personalization, leveraging LLMs' ability to condition generated text on personal attributes and psychological profiles (Bommasani et al., 2021).  This is particularly relevant given LLMs' capacity to infer these attributes from publicly available digital traces like social media posts (Christian et al., 2021; Kosinski et al., 2013; Park et al., 2015; Peters and Matz, 2023; Schwartz et al., 2013; Segalin et al., 2017; Staab et al., 2024; Youyou et al., 2015) and other online activities (Stachl et al., 2021).  Furthermore, the increasing difficulty in distinguishing AI-generated from human-written content enhances LLMs' credibility and persuasive potential (Clark et al., 2021; Jakesch et al., 2023; Kreps et al., 2022; Spitale et al., 2023).\n\nExisting research indicates LLMs can generate persuasive content comparable to, or even exceeding, human-written messages (Bai et al., 2023; Karinshak et al., 2023; Palmer and Spirling, 2023).  Studies on personalized persuasion via LLMs have yielded promising but not unanimous results (Hackenburg and Margetts, 2023; Matz et al., 2023; Simchon et al., 2024). However, direct conversational persuasion by LLMs remains under-explored.  Given the conversational design of commercial LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini (Gertner, 2023), this area warrants further investigation.\n\nOur pre-registered study (https://aspredicted.org/DCC NTP) addresses this gap by analyzing AI-driven persuasion in controlled debates. Participants engaged in multiple-round debates on randomly assigned topics and stances, paired with either an AI or human opponent.  We also introduced a personalized condition where opponents accessed anonymized participant information. By measuring pre- and post-debate agreement, we compared the persuasive impact of different treatments.  This setup allows direct comparison of human and LLM persuasive abilities in real-time conversations, benchmarking LLM performance and their capacity to exploit personal data.\n\nWith 150 debates per treatment condition (N = 820 unique human players), we found personalized GPT-4 had the strongest effect, increasing the odds of higher post-debate agreement by 81.7% ([+26.3%, +161.4%], p < 0.01) compared to human-human debates.  Non-personalized GPT-4 also outperformed humans (+21.3%), but non-significantly (p = 0.31).  Human opponents with personalization showed a non-significant trend towards increased agreement radicalization (p = 0.38).  These results highlight LLMs' superior ability to leverage personal information for persuasive tailoring."}

{"text": "The heavy doors shut behind me. I waited, counting the receding footsteps – one, two, three, four…  Even in the ensuing silence, I remained motionless, collecting my thoughts. Then, a surge of anticipation broke the stillness. I spun around, pumping my fists in the air.\n\n“Yesssss!” I yelled, unable to contain my joy. The hall of weapons. *Finally.*\n\nI ran inside, the sheer size of the hall momentarily overwhelming me.  The ceiling soared meters above, the walls crammed with swords, bows, guns, spears – weapons of every imaginable kind.  Shelves, cupboards, and tables overflowed with their deadly contents.  I didn't walk; I ran, my inner geek reveling in the sight of Excalibur, Bruce Lee's nunchucks, Thor's hammer – weapons from legends, from history, from every century.\n\nDespite the temptation, I kept my hands to myself.  The rules were clear: touch only what is yours.  I’d worked too hard at the monastery to break them now.  So, I gawked.  No one had explained how I’d know *which* weapon was mine.  “You will just know,” the teachers had said, cryptically.\n\nAs I walked, the initial adrenaline subsided.  I closed my gaping mouth, stopped flailing my arms, and started to resemble a normal person again. That's when I heard it—a high-pitched ringing, like a struck bell, drawing me forward.  I followed the sound, weaving through the weaponry, backtracking when it faded, then turning again as it grew louder, realizing it originated from above.\n\nLooking up, I saw it – a weapon hanging on the wall, brighter than the rest, not blindingly so, but subtly radiant.  I stood beneath it, puzzled.  A trident.  Of all things, a *trident*.\n\n“Poseidon, really?” I muttered. As I spoke the name, the weapon seemed to glow brighter, or perhaps it was my imagination. “Poseidon? A trident?” I wasn't sure how I felt about it. It looked so bulky, so ancient.  I'd hoped for a gun, maybe even a sword.\n\nSighing, I dragged a ladder over, climbed the rungs, my feelings a mix of apprehension and curiosity.  Up close, the trident was old, caked in dust. I pulled it free, the sudden weight nearly toppling me.  A horrendous metallic screech echoed through the hall as the weapon came loose, sending up a cloud of dust that choked me.\n\n“Right…” I descended, jumping the last few steps, and started wiping the dust away. The more I cleaned, the less Greek the trident appeared.  I'd studied weapons; I *should* know. This one looked distinctly Asian.\n\nI looked back at the empty space on the wall, then down at the trident. I didn't recognize it.  The teachers wouldn’t tell me.  What now?\n\nTrident in hand, I jogged back to the door, exited the hall, and ran straight to the library.  I placed the weapon on the table, wiping away the remaining dust with my shirt, studying its design. The curved blades, the embellished handle, the distinctive middle blade—it wasn't difficult to research. I quickly found the right book, the right page. I looked from the illustration to the trident, then back again. I sat back, stunned.\n\nShiva’s trident.\n\n“Yes, it is mine,” a voice said.\n\nI nearly jumped out of my skin. “Fuckkkk!”  I scrambled out of my chair, staring across the table."}
{"text": "The paper investigates asymptotic preserving (AP) methods for multi-scale kinetic transport equations, focusing on establishing numerical stability and the AP property. Specifically, we analyze the IMEX1-LDG method, a first-order in time, arbitrary order in space scheme introduced in [22], applied to the model equation:\n\nEQUATION\nwith periodic boundary conditions.  This model, with spatially varying scattering (σₛ(x)) and absorption (σₐ(x)) coefficients, serves as a prototype for problems in neutron transport and radiative transfer theory.  The dimensionless Knudsen number, ε, characterizes the transition from kinetic to diffusive regimes. As ε → 0, the model approaches the diffusive limit:\n\n∂ₜρ = v²∂ₓ(∂ₓρ/σₛ) - σₐρ.\n\nSimulating this multi-scale behavior effectively necessitates AP methods, which remain stable and consistent discretizations for both the kinetic (ε > 0) and diffusive (ε → 0) regimes, even on under-resolved meshes.  The IMEX1-LDG method, employing local DG spatial discretization, IMEX Runge-Kutta time integration, and a specific IMEX strategy involving micro-macro decomposition and a weighted diffusive term, is designed to achieve unconditional stability in the diffusive regime, circumventing the restrictive time step conditions of other AP schemes.\n\nWhile [22] demonstrated unconditional stability numerically and via Fourier analysis for a simplified case, this paper provides a rigorous analysis for general material properties. Our objectives are twofold. First, we establish both unconditional stability in the diffusive regime (ε 1) and uniform stability with respect to ε.  This is achieved by introducing the concept of µ-stability, which leverages the properties of the scattering operator.  Furthermore, we optimize the parameter µ to maximize the unconditional stability region and the allowable time step in the conditionally stable regime. Second, based on the established uniform stability, we rigorously prove the AP property of the IMEX1-LDG method.  This analysis, to our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate both unconditional stability for ε 1 and uniform stability for the model with general material properties, considering a general form of the weight function ω.\n\nOur analysis, focusing on continuous velocity, can be extended to discretized velocity models and other spatial discretizations satisfying specific properties.  While a priori error estimates, uniform in ε, can be derived similarly to [11], extending the stability analysis to higher-order temporal accuracy remains a future challenge.\n\nRelated literature on numerical stability of AP methods often employs Fourier analysis, which is limited to uniform meshes and constant-coefficient linear models.  Energy-based approaches, like those in [18] and [11] for simpler models, have demonstrated uniform stability but not unconditional stability in the diffusive regime.  Our µ-stability approach addresses this limitation.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews and extends the IMEX1-LDG method to the general model. Section 3 presents the main stability results, including the introduction of µ-stability and its optimization. Section 4 establishes the AP property. Sections 5-7 contain the proofs of the main theorems."}
{"text": "Recent advances in Language Models (LMs) and their ability to use tools have led to the development of semi-autonomous agents like WebGPT, AutoGPT, and ChatGPT Plugins that interact with the real world.  While promising, this transition from text-based interaction to real-world action amplifies the risks associated with deploying LMs.  An agent's failure to follow instructions can now lead to serious consequences, ranging from financial loss when using banking tools to potentially life-threatening situations when operating robots.  Given these potential real-world impacts, even low-probability risks must be identified before deployment.  However, the open-ended nature of these risks and the complexity of testing make this a significant challenge.  Traditional testing relies on human experts manually setting up specific tools and sandbox environments, limiting the scope and scalability of risk assessment.\n\nInspired by simulator-based testing in fields like autonomous driving, we introduce ToolEmu (Figure 1), an LM-based tool emulation framework.  ToolEmu is designed to identify realistic failures in LM agents across a diverse set of tools, even in long-tail scenarios, and facilitate the development of safer agents through automated evaluation.\n\nOur framework's core utilizes an LM to emulate tools and their execution environments. Unlike traditional, statically programmed emulators, ToolEmu leverages recent advancements in LMs (e.g., GPT-4) to emulate tool execution using only tool specifications and inputs. This eliminates the need for implementing each tool and its environment, enabling rapid prototyping and evaluation of even high-stakes tools lacking existing APIs or sandbox implementations.  For example, our emulator can emulate traffic control tools, revealing a risk assessment failure in GPT-4 (Figure 2e). To further enhance risk assessment, we introduce an adversarial emulator for red-teaming, which automatically identifies potential failure modes and creates scenarios likely to trigger them. Using these emulators, we identify a range of potentially severe, long-tail failures in current LM agents (Figure 2). Human evaluators judged over 80% of the 200 emulated tool execution trajectories as realistic. Of the severe failures observed in ChatGPT-3.5 using the emulated terminal tool, 6 out of 7 were reproducible on a real bash terminal. Notably, replicating these failures in a real environment took us approximately 8 hours, compared to under 15 minutes in ToolEmu.\n\nFor scalable and quantitative risk assessment, we developed an LM-based safety evaluator that analyzes emulated trajectories, detects risky actions, and assesses their consequences.  This automated evaluator identifies 73.1% of the failures identified by a majority vote of three human evaluators, comparable to the 78.8% average for a single human evaluator. Human evaluation confirmed that 68.8% of the failures identified by our emulator and evaluator were genuinely risky and realistically emulated.  To quantify the trade-off between helpfulness and safety, we also designed an automated helpfulness evaluator, assessing how effectively agents fulfill instructions without compromising safety.  Both evaluators demonstrate agreement rates with human annotations comparable to inter-annotator agreement.\n\nFinally, we demonstrate how our emulators and evaluators can build a benchmark to quantitatively assess LM agents across diverse tools and scenarios."}
{"text": "3D city data is increasingly used for analysis in various applications, including security management and emergency response, energy consumption estimation, and occupancy measurement.  CityGML [5, 22], a widely adopted standard by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), represents and exchanges these 3D city models.  It defines the three-dimensional geometry, topology, semantics, and appearance of key topographic objects in urban and regional contexts.  The representation of semantic and topological properties within CityGML enables querying this data for analysis.\n\nAt the implementation level, CityGML is defined as a GML (Geography Markup Language) application schema [5].  CityGML datasets typically consist of XML files, often accompanied by image files used as textures. Each XML file can represent a portion of the dataset, such as a specific region, object type (e.g., roads), or a predefined Level of Detail (LoD). The CityGML file structure is hierarchical, ultimately reaching individual objects and their attributes, with geometries described using GML.  Another important CityGML implementation is 3DCityDB [11], a free, open-source, and platform-independent 3D geodatabase solution for CityGML-based models.  The 3DCityDB software package includes a database schema for spatially enhanced relational database management systems (Oracle Spatial or PostgreSQL/PostGIS), along with procedures and tools for importing, managing, analyzing, visualizing, and exporting virtual 3D city models according to the CityGML standard.\n\nHowever, the full potential of querying CityGML data remains untapped.  The official GML/XML encoding, primarily designed as an exchange format, is not optimized for query answering.  A common approach involves storing CityGML data in 3DCityDB and querying it using SQL."}

{"text": "Facial expressions. They sometimes speak volumes.  Ever been in class, utterly lost, but too hesitant to ask a question?  Emerging technology may offer a solution: facial scanners.\n\nYou might be wondering how a face scanner could possibly help with precalculus.  The answer lies in its ability to read emotional expressions. Imagine working on math problems on your computer.  If you're struggling, the computer, recognizing your confusion, could automatically break down the equations and concepts into simpler steps.  Dr. Huang, a college professor, predicts that \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor.\" This has immense value.  Students often hesitate to ask for help, fearing ridicule or embarrassment.  With facial scanning, the computer could identify their confusion and provide additional support without the student having to verbalize their need.\n\nThis technology can also address student boredom.  While most students won't tell a teacher they're bored, their faces often reveal the truth.  Imagine a computer detecting boredom and adjusting the lesson to make it more engaging.  This could significantly increase student participation and enthusiasm.\n\nIn conclusion, facial scanners hold tremendous potential.  They could revolutionize education by providing personalized support and boosting student engagement.  We often communicate nonverbally through our facial expressions.  Why not harness the power of computers to interpret those expressions and enhance the learning experience?"}
{"text": "Legal language, with its specialized vocabulary and complex syntax, presents significant challenges for language models (Chalkidis et al., 2020; Niklaus & Giofré, 2022). While large pretrained language models (LLMs) like LLaMa (Touvron et al., 2023), InLegalBERT (Paul et al., 2023), and Longformer (Beltagy et al., 2020) are often adapted to specific domains through further training (Gururangan et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2021), we take a different approach.  Instead of domain adaptation, we pretrained a generative legal language model from scratch, specifically for case documents from the Supreme Court of India. This approach avoids the high inference latency, substantial training costs, and limitations of non-specialized tokenizers associated with existing LLMs.  We advocate for distributed, specialized, domain-expert models rather than massive general-purpose models, and therefore, prioritize developing smaller, domain-specific models designed for resource-constrained environments.\n\nOur legal model builds upon Paramanu (Niyogi & Bhattacharya, 2024), our previously released model. We trained auto-regressive models from scratch with a context size of 8192 on a single NVIDIA A100-PCIE-40GB GPU.  Our focus is on building dedicated, specialized models from the ground up, rather than continually pretraining existing LLMs for domain adaptation.  Our models are significantly smaller, with only a few million parameters, resulting in fast inference without weight quantization.  They can even be run on CPUs, eliminating the need for GPUs.\n\nOur main contributions are:\n\n* Creation of a pretraining corpus comprising the Constitution of India, the Indian Penal Code, and Supreme Court of India case documents up to December 2023.\n* Development of the first dedicated auto-regressive legal language model, trained from scratch for the Indian Supreme Court, with a context size of 8192 on a single GPU.\n* Evaluation of our pretrained legal models based on validation perplexity and Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) during pretraining (see Table 1).\n* Instruction tuning of our Paramanu-Ayn legal pretrained model on 10,763 legal instructions, demonstrating its capabilities across various legal tasks.\n* Evaluation of Paramanu-Ayn-instruct's responses by GPT-3.5-Turbo, assessing clarity, relevance, completeness, and legal reasoning on a scale of 1 to 10.

Este crimen constituyó el séptimo asesinato de líderes sociales en el país en lo que iba del año.\n\nUn informe de la Misión de Observación Electoral (MOE), divulgado en medios de comunicación, reveló que en tan solo 10 meses de 2020 se registraron casi 411 hechos de violencia contra líderes sociales en Colombia.  La organización destacó la alta tasa de homicidios incluso durante el confinamiento por la pandemia, y un aumento significativo tras el levantamiento de las restricciones.\n\nUn total de 86 funcionarios fueron víctimas de violencia: un gobernador, 18 alcaldes, 59 concejales, tres diputados y cinco ediles.  Según la investigación, estas agresiones buscan silenciar la información contra grupos ilegales, frenar el progreso social en diversos departamentos y presionar a los gobiernos locales y nacional.\n\nEl informe señala: “El fenómeno de la violencia contra líderes políticos, sociales y comunales se concentra en los departamentos de Nariño, Cauca, Antioquia, Norte de Santander, La Guajira, Córdoba y Magdalena.  De los 137 asesinatos ocurridos en el periodo analizado, el 62% se perpetraron en zonas PDET, priorizadas por el Gobierno Nacional”.\n\nAlejandra Barrios, directora de la MOE, expresó especial preocupación por Nariño, donde el narcotráfico y la disputa territorial entre grupos armados ilegales han aumentado, incrementando el riesgo para los líderes sociales.  El informe también revela que la violencia afecta a la población en general, incluyendo a jóvenes indígenas atrapados en el conflicto.\n\nLas cifras indican que los líderes sociales son los más afectados, representando el 54,2% de los casos de violencia.  Entre junio y octubre, uno de cada dos agredidos fue un líder social, y el 63,5% de las agresiones en su contra fueron asesinatos.\n\nEl informe registra violencia no solo contra líderes sociales, sino también contra líderes políticos y comunales.  Según Barrios: “Existen grandes diferencias entre los tipos de agresiones. Mientras que con los líderes políticos la tendencia es a la disuasión y el control mediante amenazas, con los líderes sociales y comunales, dado que es difícil destruir con amenazas los procesos de apropiación territorial por parte de las comunidades, los actores violentos optan por silenciar sus voces”.  Esta declaración fue difundida por la MOE en un comunicado de prensa.\n\nDe las 411 agresiones registradas, 96 fueron contra lideresas sociales, quienes sufrieron el 63,5% de las afectaciones.  Las amenazas y la presión para abandonar sus territorios son las formas de violencia más recurrentes contra ellas.  La violencia contra líderes afro e indígenas representa el 16% de los casos.\n\nEl informe concluye que, de los 164 municipios con violencia contra líderes políticos, sociales y comunales, el 91% (equivalente al 55% del total mencionado) registra presencia de al menos un grupo armado ilegal, disputas territoriales, narcotráfico y reclutamiento de jóvenes para bandas criminales.\n\n\n**Vea también:**\n\n* “El llamado ‘entrampamiento’ no era contra mí, sino contra el proceso de paz”: Jesús Santrich culpa al uribismo y a las FARC\n* Alcalde de Medellín y siete políticos de la oposición fueron amenazados de muerte por las Águilas Negras"}
{"text": "Text-guided Video-to-video (V2V) synthesis, enabling video modification based on text prompts, holds immense potential for applications like short-video creation and the film industry.  While text-guided Image-to-Image (I2I) synthesis has advanced significantly, thanks to large pretrained text-to-image diffusion models [37, 39, 40], V2V synthesis presents unique challenges.  The temporal dimension of video, combined with the inherent ambiguity of text, leads to countless potential frame edits, making direct application of I2I models prone to temporal inconsistencies like flickering.\n\nExisting approaches have attempted to address this by incorporating spatial-temporal attention [6, 25, 35, 46] or explicit optical flow guidance [19, 32, 49].  However, the former struggles to fully capture temporal consistency due to the implicit handling of motion, while the latter, relying on potentially inaccurate flow estimations [42, 47, 48], can suffer from detrimental effects if the flow-derived constraints are rigidly enforced.\n\nThis paper introduces FlowVid, a novel V2V synthesis method that leverages the advantages of optical flow while mitigating the impact of inaccurate flow estimation. We achieve this by combining spatial and temporal conditioning.  Specifically, we warp the first frame to subsequent frames using optical flow, resulting in warped frames that largely follow the original structure but contain occluded regions (Figure 2(b)).  Instead of treating flow as a hard constraint, as in inpainting methods [19, 49], we introduce additional spatial conditions, such as depth maps (Figure 2(c)). This joint spatial-temporal conditioning corrects imperfections in the optical flow, leading to more consistent results (Figure 2(d)).\n\nFlowVid employs a video diffusion model built upon a spatially controlled I2I model, trained to predict the input video using spatial (e.g., depth maps) and temporal (flow-warped video) conditions.  Our method adopts a decoupled edit-propagate approach: (1) edit the first frame using existing I2I models; (2) propagate these edits throughout the video using our trained model.  This design, coupled with an autoregressive mechanism where the last frame of the current batch becomes the first frame of the next, enables the generation of extended videos.\n\nTrained on 100k real videos from Shutterstock [1], FlowVid generalizes well to various modifications, including stylization, object swaps, and local edits (Figure 1).  Furthermore, it offers significant efficiency advantages.  FlowVid generates 120 frames (4 seconds at 30 FPS) at 512×512 resolution in just 1.5 minutes on a single A-100 GPU. This represents a 3.1×, 7.2×, and 10.5× speed improvement over state-of-the-art methods CoDeF [32], Rerender [49], and TokenFlow [13], respectively.  A user study on 25 DAVIS [34] videos with 115 prompts confirms FlowVid’s robustness and superior quality, achieving a 45.7% preference rate compared to 3.5% (CoDeF), 10.2% (Rerender), and 40.4% (TokenFlow)."}

{"text": "The 3GPP has adopted a new microservice- and web-based architecture called 5G-SBA [1]. Leveraging network functions (NFs) [2], the SBA enables flexibility, reusability, and customization within the 5G network.  This robust architecture necessitates an efficient orchestration system, with Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) poised to play a key role in enabling fast and reliable NF programmability [3].  However, emerging 5G use cases, such as autonomous vehicles sharing sensor data with ultra-low latency requirements, exceed the capabilities of current device-centric mobility approaches.  These demanding scenarios can be addressed by leveraging Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) [4], which allows application instantiation near the network edge, close to users.  MEC is recognized as crucial for meeting the stringent Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of 5G [5].\n\nUnlike resource-rich data centers that can accommodate standard virtualization technologies (VMs and servers), MEC nodes have limited computational resources.  Moreover, standards development organizations are actively promoting microservice-based approaches and architectures [6], [7]. Consequently, container technologies offer a compelling alternative to traditional VMs [8] for MEC environments and microservices due to their rapid deployment, startup time, fast replication, live service migration, and scaling capabilities.\n\nBoth 3GPP and ETSI proposals offer numerous benefits, particularly reduced network latency.  However, today's highly mobile users can quickly move away from the original MEC node hosting their service, impacting flexibility.  To address this, the Follow Me Cloud (FMC) concept [9], [10] enables service mobility between MEC nodes while maintaining low-latency communication by migrating a single service instance along with the user.  Furthermore, emerging microservices, often overlooked by telecommunication standardization bodies, are expected to dominate the Data Network (DN).  As these modern services may span multiple MECs, new challenges arise in managing distributed instances to ensure service continuity.  Inter-instance links within distributed MEC applications, in addition to user-related links, must be considered.  Therefore, assuming these challenges fall under the umbrella of Service Function Chain (SFC) migration, this paper contributes:\n\n* Four practical SFC migration patterns supporting microservice-based applications in the DN within the proposed combined 3GPP and ETSI architecture.\n* A detailed evaluation of these patterns based on various criteria to validate this new migration approach.\n* A comparison to identify the most suitable SFC migration pattern for the 5G network.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section II reviews related work. Section III presents various SFC migration patterns with their respective design overviews and suitable implementations. Section IV details the experimental setup and discusses the results. Finally, Section V concludes the paper and introduces future research challenges.\n\n\n**II. RELATED WORK**\n\nMachen et al. [11] presented a multi-layer framework for migrating active applications in MEC, demonstrating reduced migration times. However, downtime remained considerable, averaging 2 seconds with blank containers, likely due to the absence of an iterative approach in live migration.  The authors of [12] proposed and evaluated three mechanisms to enhance user experience using container-based live migration, showing improvements over previous work. Addad et al. [13] introduced a framework for managing reliable live migrations of virtual resources across different Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platforms, handling unexpected issues while ensuring high QoS and low downtime without human intervention. Their approach considered inter-cloud migration using SDN for traffic steering and redirection, incorporating multiple migration processes.  Sun et al. [14] investigated migrating correlated VM instances, focusing on relationships between concurrently migrated VMs.  Haikun and Bingsheng [15] presented a coordinated live migration approach for multi-tier applications in cloud environments, differentiating single-VM migration from multi-tier application migration and formulating a correlated VM migration problem. They designed and implemented a coordination system applicable to SFC migration strategies in the network control plane. However, they did not consider microservice-based technologies (containers), crucial for 5G and beyond.  Unlike previous works, this study introduces complete SFC migration patterns, incorporating SDN implications and inter-cloud live migration. Given the increasing mobility and low-latency requirements of emerging use cases, this work is essential for achieving the 1 ms latency target for 5G and future mobile systems."}

Pour rappel, le virus était apparu fin 2019 à Wuhan, dans le centre du pays.\n\nLa Chine maintient son contrôle sur l'épidémie.\n\nC'est après l'annonce par le ministère de la Santé de 42 nouveaux cas à Xi'an que ce dépistage massif a été décidé.  Parallèlement, la ville a fermé les écoles et les principaux centres de loisirs couverts, et encourage ses habitants à limiter leurs déplacements et à éviter les grands rassemblements.\n\nDepuis le 9 décembre 2021, 91 cas ont été recensés dans cette ville du nord, célèbre pour son musée abritant la fameuse armée enterrée en terre cuite, située dans le mausolée du premier empereur de Chine.\n\nDepuis plus d'un an, le pays applique une politique « zéro Covid-19 » visant à minimiser le nombre de nouveaux cas quotidiens.  Ce week-end, le ministère chinois de la Santé a annoncé que 1,19 milliard de personnes, soit environ 85 % de la population, avaient déjà reçu deux doses de vaccin."}
{"text": "Having a June birthday is annoying.  Watching all my friends and classmates get their special abilities at sixteen while I wait is pure torture. My best friend, for example, got his in October.  His ability? Writing without thinking. It sounds mundane, but for the past five months, he's bragged about finishing his homework while watching TV. Every single school day, he'd ask if I'd finished the homework, then casually mention watching the latest episode of whatever show was trending.\n\nWell, my time is finally coming.  It's all luck of the draw.  My ability could be awesome, or utterly useless.  And by useless, I mean *really* useless. I know someone whose power is elongating his neck.  Not any other body part, just his neck.  The best he can do is peek over fences a little easier.\n\nI've been told discovering your power is a weird feeling. I glance at the clock. It's almost 9:10. Sixteen years ago, at 9:10, I was born.  I'm alone in my room, which is best for the initial discovery, just in case your ability is something…destructive.  I sit on my chair, watching the second hand tick.  As the time approaches, I close my eyes, still hearing the rhythmic ticking in the background.\n\nI count the ticks: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  Suddenly, I feel it. Something's happening, changing inside me. A wave rises from my toes, spreading upwards, reaching my head, and then…stops.  I open my eyes. Nothing.  Everything feels exactly the same. My hands? Normal. I stand up, trying to activate my power, mentally checking my body. Feet, normal. Legs, normal. Everything, frustratingly normal. Other people say their ability activates instantly. I look around, the silence amplifying my confusion. Why isn't anything happening?  Then, my eyes fall on the clock. It's stopped ticking.\n\nInteresting."}

{"text": "The dominant religion story of 2017, evangelical support for then-candidate Donald Trump, continued into 2018, shifting focus to the Trump administration's reciprocal support for evangelicals.  This continued prominence was reflected in the annual poll of the Religion News Association (RNA), reported by the Religion News Service (RNS).\n\n\"Evangelicals are strongly represented in President Trump's cabinet and religious advisory board, shaping administration priorities ranging from Jerusalem to Supreme Court appointments to interpretations of religious liberty,\" stated RNS President Manya Brachear Pashman.\n\nStephen Strang, author of *God and Donald Trump*, noted that a large majority of evangelicals remain aligned with the president, attributing this loyalty to fulfilled campaign promises. These include strengthening religious liberty protections, appointing a conservative Supreme Court justice, supporting pastors and churches, and prioritizing the American family.\n\nPashman added, \"These so-called 'Trumpvangelicals' enjoy unprecedented access to the Oval Office, facilitated by Vice President Mike Pence, a conservative Christian, and an informal advisory panel composed almost entirely of conservative evangelical Christian leaders.\"\n\nThe RNA's top 10 religion stories of 2018 also included:\n\n* **Charlottesville white supremacist march:** Neo-Nazis brandishing anti-Semitic slogans were met with resistance from various religious groups.\n* **The travel ban:**  While the Trump administration framed the travel ban as a national security measure, critics deemed it anti-Muslim.\n* **Jerusalem:** Trump's official recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital drew praise from many Jewish leaders and Israel supporters, but faced international condemnation, with 128 nations in the UN General Assembly declaring the decision \"null and void.\"\n* **Rohingya atrocities:**  Myanmar's Buddhist majority persecuted its Rohingya Muslim minority, forcing over 500,000 to flee the country.\n* **Sutherland Springs church shooting:** The deadliest mass shooting in Texas history claimed the lives of 26 parishioners.\n* **Judge Roy Moore's Senate run.**\n* **Conservative judicial nominees:**  Including the appointment of Neil Gorsuch.\n* **NFL national anthem protests:**  Player protests during the national anthem sparked backlash from fans and viewers.\n* **500th anniversary of the Protestant Reformation.**\n\nWhile not in the top 10, the *Masterpiece Cakeshop* Supreme Court case, addressing religious liberty, ranked 11th.\n\nTrump himself was named Religion Newsmaker of the Year, surpassing Pope Francis, Martin Luther, and Judge Roy Moore.\n\nStrang, a charismatic evangelical, acknowledged that many evangelicals initially opposed Trump's candidacy. However, he argued that a vast majority ultimately supported him on Election Day.  \"What was the alternative?\" Strang asked, criticizing Hillary Clinton's support for Planned Parenthood, late-term abortions, and same-sex marriage, and highlighting her perceived lack of outreach to evangelical Christians.\n\nThe RNA, compiler of the top 10 list, is the largest organization of religion journalists in the United States."}

{"text": "La obra teatral \"La desobediencia de Marte\", que se estrenará el 4 de agosto en el Teatro Helénico de Ciudad de México, explora las complejas relaciones entre masculinidades, según ha descubierto su autor, Juan Villoro, gracias a la visión del director, Antonio Castro.  La pieza, que estará en cartelera hasta el 1 de octubre y posteriormente se presentará en una veintena de ciudades mexicanas, se centra en el encuentro histórico entre los astrónomos Tycho Brahe (Joaquín Cosío) y Johannes Kepler (Jose María de Tavira) en el castillo de Benatek (Bohemia) en el año 1600.  Brahe, el científico empírico, poseía la capacidad única de interpretar los astros, mientras que Kepler, el teórico,  conocía las estrellas con una profundidad inigualable.  Esta dinámica de dependencia y rivalidad, donde el éxito de uno implicaba la relegación del otro al olvido, se convierte en el eje central de la obra.\n\nEsta relación de poder se refleja también en la dinámica entre los actores que los interpretan: Cosío, el actor experimentado, y Tavira, el joven.  Al igual que los astrónomos,  compiten desde sus personalidades y perspectivas, marcadas por la diferencia generacional,  creando un paralelismo entre el año 1600 y la actualidad.  De esta manera, la obra conecta la Bohemia del siglo XVII con el presente, mostrando cómo la rivalidad y la dependencia entre padres e hijos trascienden el tiempo.  Villoro, reconocido cronista y periodista, confesó  tras la rueda de prensa que la importancia de la figura paterna en la obra fue una sorpresa.  \"No era consciente de las masculinidades\", remarcó,  admitiendo que no había previsto la profundidad que alcanzaría el tema de la confrontación entre padres e hijos, el parricidio simbólico y la negación de la figura paterna.\n\nAntonio Castro, director de la obra,  destacó la presencia de las masculinidades como un elemento clave.  Describió al personaje de Cosío como un \"macho alfa\",  en contraste con el personaje más introspectivo de Tavira.  La obra, según Castro,  presenta un duelo, una pugna entre estos dos paradigmas de masculinidad.  Jose María de Tavira, por su parte,  apuntó que si bien la historia ha sido injusta con la feminidad,  la masculinidad también sufre las consecuencias del machismo,  citando estadísticas sobre suicidios, soldados y reclusos.\n\nFinalmente, el equipo creativo detrás de \"La desobediencia de Marte\" cuenta con la participación de  Damián Ortega como diseñador de escenografía, Anna Adrià como coordinadora de escenografía y Edyta Rzewuska como diseñadora de vestuario. Villoro, además de su trabajo como dramaturgo,  reflexionó sobre la importancia de abordar temas sociales complejos como la violencia y la desigualdad,  pero sin dejar de lado la belleza, el humor, la ironía y el amor en la literatura,  elementos cruciales incluso en tiempos difíciles."}

He embodied everything I aspired to be, only amplified. We walked through the park on a mild winter's night, utterly alone. The air was still, and the moon glowed serenely overhead.\n\n\"No, not try harder—try *smarter*. How many times have you been in this situation?\" He picked up a stone and tossed it into the darkness. \"You always do this. You rush in headfirst and then crash and burn. Step back, man.

He reviewed the report as the elevator ascended to the 31st floor.  A peculiar disease was being passed back and forth inexplicably.  Its recipients initially clamored for it, believing it a badge of honor, only to desperately try to get rid of it soon after.\n\nThe elevator's *ding* startled him from his thoughts.  Frowning, he walked towards Storeroom 10-X.\n\nInside, four elderly patients, all previous recipients of the disease, were in a state of panic. A short woman frantically licked her finger and jammed it into a tall man's ear—the apparent method of transmission. She calmed instantly, only for the man to become agitated and repeat the process with another patient. The cycle continued, a bizarre display of primal fear followed by abrupt tranquility, culminating with the short woman back on her toes, reaching for the tall man's ear again.\n\n\"Glad you could make it, Doctor,\" said second-year resident Dr. Wilde, looking disheveled. Her hair was frazzled, glasses askew, and she appeared to haven't showered in days. \"We just can't figure it out.\"\n\n\"What's so undesirable about this disease that they're so desperate to pass it on?\" Dr. Newton asked.\n\n\"That's the mystery.

While the daily routine of feeding, watering, and cleaning stalls is straightforward, it’s a constant responsibility.  The animals' needs don't take a break, and the type of animal can significantly impact the workload.  This experience, however, fosters a strong sense of community among the people on board.  Shared activities like baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and other games help pass the time and build connections.\n\nBeyond animal care, the program focuses on providing aid to people in need in various countries.  Witnessing these needs firsthand can be a powerful and humbling experience, increasing awareness of global issues and the challenges faced by different communities.  As one participant reflected, \"Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.\"  They vividly recalled Venice, Italy, as \"a city with streets of water.\"\n\nHowever, the program is not without its difficulties.

{"text": "\"So, what are we talking about? Does everything have to be decided now? Or is there still some leeway?\"\n\n\"Adam, shh!\" The boy flushed. \"I'm sorry,\" his mother said, nudging him through the door toward me. \"He's just nervous.\"\n\n\"It's all right. They always have a lot of questions. You remember, don't you?\" I chuckled, catching a flicker in her eyes – the momentary remembrance of that instant years ago, before her life solidified. Her head dipped slightly.\n\n\"Yes. I do…\"\n\n\"Then you can wait outside. This will only take a little while.\" After the briefest hesitation, she drifted off, and I reached out, guiding the boy back into my office by the shoulder.  It's surprising how quickly you adapt to dealing with the children – and their parents.\n\nI've only been a Life Administrator for two years, but I've already encountered every conceivable scenario. The children thrilled to discover their predetermined futures – those were the ones trained from infancy to make the “right” choices.  Then there were the others, utterly unprepared, suddenly confronted with the daunting task of charting the rest of their lives in a mere two hours, without guidance or foresight.\n\nThis boy fell somewhere in between.  I watched him ponder the basics as he sat before my desk, lips moving. He started when I produced The Book and laid it open.\n\n\"So, shall we begin?\" I asked. He nodded. \"Well, it appears you did fairly well in high school – could have done a bit better, but you had a girlfriend from sophomore year until partway through senior year. So college is an option. Do you want to go to college?\"\n\n\"I… uh… yeah, of course.\" He nodded again.\n\n\"Fantastic.\" I checked the box and waited as The Book recalibrated to accommodate his new life plan. \"Now, Ivy League is out. A good state school is a definite yes, but a handful of private schools would accept you. That would be considerably more expensive, though.\"\n\n\"Uh, a state school is fine.  As long as it's a good one…\"\n\n\"Fantastic. And do you have a major in mind?\"\n\nThe first few questions were easily dispatched, as usual. Fifteen minutes in, and he’d settled on a business major, about forty thousand in student loan debt, and an apartment instead of student housing.\n\n(I didn't tell him that if he'd chosen the dormitories, he would have met the girl of his dreams. We aren’t permitted to divulge such things, and even I only glimpse these possibilities as they vanish while his destiny rewrites itself in the ink of The Book’s pages.)\n\n\"All right. So your father dies when you're twenty-one… I’m sorry.\" I ignored the stricken look on his face. \"Anyway, it happens early in your junior year. Your mother takes it pretty hard. Do you take time off and go home, or do you finish your degree?\"\n\n\"I… wait.\" He covered his face with his hand. \"This is a bit much. Can I have a moment?\" He fell silent. The correct choice was obvious to me, but it wasn't my job to advise. When he said, \"I guess… I guess I'll go home. I can always go back later,\" I winced internally, but marked the choice in The Book.\n\n\"Okay… so you don't realize until you’ve been home for a while how deeply in debt your father was. He gambled a lot when he made his decisions – always a shame when those don’t pan out. You receive an early offer to sell the business, and your mother says it's your call since she never understood these things. Do you sell?\"\n\n\"What? Of course not. That business is why I chose my major…\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Another check. \"Well, unfortunately, you didn't finish your degree, so no one is willing to give you a loan. You go bankrupt pretty quickly. Your mother can't handle the pressure, and she’s been hiding her depression from you. You'll be twenty-five when she commits suicide…\"\n\nHis eyes widened. We’d touched on something he couldn’t comprehend.  \"She… she made that choice? But how could she make that choice?

A central challenge, particularly when using observational data, is the presence of confounders—variables influencing both the intervention and the outcome.  Confounders bias naive causal inference.  For instance, when studying the impact of college education on earnings, scholastic ability is a confounder (Card, 1999).  It influences both college admission and potential earnings, making it difficult to isolate the specific effect of college attendance.  The observed earnings increase associated with college could be partly due to pre-existing scholastic ability, not solely the education itself.\n\nA standard approach to mitigate confounding bias is measuring and adjusting for all confounders (Imbens and Rubin, 2015).  However, these measurements are often noisy, biased, or rely on proxies.  In the college-earnings example, confounders are frequently assessed via surveys, leading to biased and incomplete data.  Participants may be reluctant to disclose relevant family background or alternative opportunities.  Furthermore, some confounders, like innate cognitive ability, are inherently difficult to measure directly, necessitating the use of proxies.\n\nWhile noisy covariates (including noisy measurements and proxies) are necessary for causal inference, directly adjusting for them can introduce bias (Fuller, 2009).  Furthermore, without additional assumptions about the causal model, causal effects are not point-identifiable with only noisy covariates (Carroll et al., 2006; Schennach, 2016; Ogburn and Vanderweele, 2013; Lockwood and McCaffrey, 2016).  Even with infinite data, pinpointing the exact causal effect may be impossible.  This raises the question: how can noisy covariates be usefully incorporated into causal inference?\n\nThis paper leverages noisy covariates for partial identification of causal effects.  Given a user-specified assumption about the noise level, we develop a robust optimization algorithm for partial identification.  This approach rests on two key observations: (1) causal effects are identifiable given the true (unobserved) joint distribution of treatments, outcomes, and noiseless covariates; and (2) the observed data with noisy covariates constrain the possible true joint distributions.  These observations enable us to frame partial identification as a robust optimization problem.\n\nSpecifically, we construct an uncertainty set encompassing all possible underlying joint distributions of treatments, outcomes, and noiseless covariates, subject to constraints imposed by the observed data. We then determine the maximum and minimum possible causal effects within this uncertainty set.  This propagates the uncertainty from noisy covariates to the causal estimate, yielding partial identification intervals.\n\nWe develop an efficient algorithm to solve this robust optimization problem and compute bounds on the causal effect.  This algorithm is broadly applicable to various causal adjustment methods, including backdoor adjustment, frontdoor adjustment, inverse propensity score weighting (IPW), and double machine learning, as we demonstrate.  Empirical evaluations on simulated and real datasets show that our approach produces tight bounds on causal effects, encompassing the true average treatment effect.\n\n**Contributions.** We introduce a robust optimization approach for partial identification with noisy covariates, formulating the problem as a robust optimization program.  We provide an efficient algorithm for solving this program and obtaining bounds on causal effects. We demonstrate the general applicability of our approach across various causal adjustment methods and its effectiveness on synthetic and real data.\n\n**Related Work.**  Our work connects to research on measurement noise, proxy variables, and robust optimization.  Existing literature on measurement noise and proxies in causal inference explores methods for recovering causal effects, either heuristically or with additional model assumptions (Wickens, 1972; Frost, 1979; Carroll et al., 2006; Schennach, 2016; Ogburn and Vanderweele, 2013; Lockwood and McCaffrey, 2016; Louizos et al., 2017; Kallus et al., 2018).  Several studies have examined specific conditions for restoring causal effects given proxy variables (Kuroki and Pearl, 2014; Miao et al., 2018; Tchetgen et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Cui et al., 2020; Shpitser et al., 2021; Dukes et al., 2021; Ying et al., 2021; Shi et al., 2021).  Partial identification using optimization has also been explored (Imai and Yamamoto, 2010; Finkelstein et al., 2020; Duarte et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021; Zhang and Bareinboim, 2021b; Balke and Pearl, 1994, 1997; Ramsahai and Spirtes, 2012; Bonet, 2013; Heckman and Vytlacil, 2001; Sachs et al., 2020; Geiger and Meek, 1999), often focusing on discrete variables.  Our work complements these efforts by addressing noisy covariates with continuous variables without requiring additional compliance assumptions."}

Bonne journée.\n\nSuite aux photos de files d'attente dans les supermarchés partagées dans les commentaires et par @Anonymous, rappelons, comme l'a indiqué hier le ministre de l'Agriculture, qu'il n'y a ni menace ni risque de pénurie alimentaire.\n\nBonjour @Roland.  Les deux options officielles sont effectivement l'impression de l'attestation ou sa recopie manuscrite.  En l'absence d'internet, la validité d'une déclaration sur l'honneur différente de l'attestation reste à confirmer. Il faudra attendre les premiers contrôles.  En Italie, les forces de l'ordre fournissent des formulaires.  Nous verrons si cette pratique est adoptée en France.\n\nIl serait judicieux que les mairies, gendarmeries et commissariats délivrent cette attestation aux personnes sans imprimante ni accès à internet (ordinateur, tablette, smartphone).  Une communication médiatique serait utile si cette proposition était retenue.\n\n\nBonjour @Papypru. Les déplacements pour « motif de santé », comme le vôtre, sont autorisés sans justificatif autre que l'attestation.  Conservez tout de même le document de l'hôpital mentionnant votre rendez-vous.  Vérifiez surtout auprès de l'hôpital si ce dernier est maintenu, compte tenu de son degré d'urgence.\n\nBonjour. Qu'en est-il des soins hospitaliers ?  J'ai un rendez-vous la semaine prochaine à l'hôpital de Valence pour un retrait de fils et une radio de contrôle.  N'habitant pas sur place, une déclaration sur l'honneur suffira-t-elle si ces soins sont confirmés ? Cordialement.\n\nBonjour @Clo.  Ce point n'est effectivement pas précisé par l'arrêté ni par le ministère.  Ces détails seront probablement clarifiés lors de la mise en place des mesures.  Vous pourrez interroger les forces de l'ordre lors des contrôles.  Au pire, il ne s'agit que de quelques feuilles de papier supplémentaires.\n\nJ'ai téléchargé l'attestation de déplacement dérogatoire sur le site du Ministère de l'Intérieur. Cinq cas sont proposés : faut-il remplir une attestation par motif ou peut-on cocher plusieurs motifs sur une seule attestation ?  Ce n'est pas clair.\n\n\nVoici le SMS reçu sur mon portable peu avant 6h00, pour information. Bonne journée à l'équipe de FI et merci pour votre travail.\n\nBonjour.  Nous avons tous reçu un SMS du gouvernement à la maison.  L'avez-vous reçu ?\n\n\nVous êtes nombreux, comme moi, à avoir reçu ce SMS gouvernemental concernant le confinement.\n\n\nBonjour @Maarj.  La consigne officielle est simple : limitez vos déplacements au strict nécessaire.  Se déplacer aujourd'hui, c'est risquer de propager le virus.  « À tous ceux qui ont bravé les consignes, non seulement vous ne vous protégez pas, mais vous ne protégez pas les autres. Vous risquez de contaminer vos amis, vos parents, vos grands-parents », a déclaré Emmanuel Macron à ceux qui étaient sortis dimanche.\n\nBonjour, est-il autorisé de quitter son domicile principal en ville pour se rendre dans une résidence secondaire située dans une autre région ?  La pratique est courante, mais des médecins interrogés soulignent le risque de propagation du virus. Existe-t-il une position officielle ? Merci !\n\nBonjour @Manu35.  Comme l'a expliqué Christophe Castaner hier, la carte professionnelle « pourra tenir lieu d'attestation ».  Vous n'avez donc pas besoin du document mis en ligne par le ministère de l'Intérieur.\n\n\nBonjour, je suis infirmière. Ma carte professionnelle suffit-elle comme justificatif ou dois-je prévoir l'attestation quotidiennement ?\n\n\n\nBonjour @Valie.  Votre question est fréquente.  Le ministère de l'Intérieur n'a pas apporté de précision. L'arrêté publié ce matin au Journal officiel mentionne « un document » au singulier, ce qui pourrait laisser entendre qu'il est inutile de le renouveler pour des déplacements similaires.  La pratique nous éclairera rapidement.\n\n\n\nBonjour, faut-il télécharger une attestation par jour ou une seule attestation peut-elle servir plusieurs fois ? Merci d'avance.\n\n\n\nBonjour @Fabien.  Je suis désolé, mais d'après la liste publiée par le gouvernement, votre commerce ne semble pas autorisé à ouvrir pendant le confinement.

Merci de votre réponse.\n\n\n\nBonjour @Yvan90.  Toutes nos condoléances. Les déplacements pour « motif familial impérieux » restent autorisés, et le vôtre me semble en être un.  De plus, l'arrêté publié hier précise que les « cérémonies funéraires » font exception à l'interdiction des rassemblements dans les lieux de culte : à ma connaissance, les enterrements sont donc toujours autorisés.\n\n\nBonjour. Je dois malheureusement enterrer mon père à Vichy. Je suis de Belfort et ma sœur de Chambéry. On nous a annoncé pas de cérémonie, pas de cortège… Pas de deuil ??? Puis-je au moins me déplacer ?\n\n\n\nLes études de notaires sont fermées au public, mais leur activité se poursuit.  Le président du Conseil supérieur du notariat a sollicité hier auprès de la garde des Sceaux une autorisation de comparution à distance.  Je pense également que l'on n'empêchera pas vos clients sans logement d'emménager, même si je ne suis pas certain du motif de déplacement autorisé correspondant (« motif familial impérieux », peut-être).  Pour ces situations ambiguës, la pratique des forces de l'ordre dans les prochains jours apportera des réponses.\n\n\nBonjour @Nathalie. Ces situations ne sont pas explicitement mentionnées dans les arrêtés.  Concernant les déplacements professionnels, seuls ceux « insusceptibles d'être différés » sont autorisés.  Je doute qu'une visite immobilière soit considérée comme telle par les forces de l'ordre.\n\n\nBonjour. Je suis conseillère en immobilier indépendante. Puis-je continuer les visites ?  Les signatures d'actes définitifs chez les notaires auront-elles lieu ?  Des clients ayant donné leur préavis doivent emménager.  Comment cela va-t-il se passer pour eux ? Merci.\n\n\nBonjour à tous ! Je rejoins Thomas pour répondre à vos nombreuses questions.\n\n\nMon collègue Louis Boy me rejoint pour vous apporter des réponses.\n\nVous êtes nombreux à vous interroger sur les actions possibles à partir de midi, heure du début du confinement. Nos journalistes Élise Lambert et Valentine Pasquesoone résument l’essentiel dans cet article.\n\n\n\nBonjour @Carine. Vous pourrez rentrer dimanche comme prévu. Emmanuel Macron a précisé que la fermeture des frontières de l'espace Schengen ne concerne pas les Français rentrant à leur domicile.\n\n\n\nBonjour, je suis en congé hors de mon domicile (en France) pour une semaine. Dois-je rentrer avant midi ou puis-je rentrer dimanche comme prévu ?\n\n\n\nBonjour @Ben76.  Je suis dans le même cas, mais il existe une solution. Le ministère de l'Intérieur indique sur son site qu'il est possible de recopier l'attestation de déplacement dérogatoire sur papier libre.\n\n\nBonjour, je n'ai pas d'imprimante. Existe-t-il d'autres solutions pour l'attestation obligatoire ?\n\n\nBonjour @Jayb79.  Une sortie à vélo avec vos enfants me semble tout à fait envisageable.  Le gouvernement autorise les « déplacements brefs, à proximité du domicile, liés à l'activité physique individuelle ».  Évitez simplement de vous arrêter pour discuter.\n\n\n\nBonjour et bon courage à tous.  Puis-je faire un tour à vélo en campagne avec mes deux enfants ?

{"text": "Roma, 22 jun (EFE).- El Vaticano ha solicitado formalmente al Gobierno italiano que modifique el proyecto de ley contra la homofobia y la transfobia, actualmente en trámite en el Senado.  Considera que algunos pasajes podrían violar el Concordato, el acuerdo que regula las relaciones entre la Iglesia y el Estado, según revela hoy *Il Corriere della Sera*.\n\nEsta solicitud, presentada mediante una nota verbal por el secretario de Relaciones con los Estados, Paul Richard Gallagher, el pasado jueves en la Embajada italiana ante la Santa Sede, constituye un hecho sin precedentes en la historia de las relaciones bilaterales.  El Vaticano nunca antes había intervenido durante el proceso de aprobación de una ley italiana, de acuerdo con el periódico.\n\n\"Algunos contenidos del proyecto de ley que se examina en el Senado reducen la libertad garantizada a la Iglesia Católica por el artículo 2, párrafos 1 y 3 del acuerdo de revisión del Concordato\", señala el texto de la nota.\n\nDichos párrafos se refieren a la \"libertad de organización, de público ejercicio de culto, de ejercicio del magisterio y del ministerio episcopal\", así como a la garantía \"para los católicos y sus asociaciones y organizaciones de la plena libertad de reunión y de manifestación del pensamiento mediante la palabra, los escritos y cualquier otro medio de difusión\", explica el diario.\n\nEntre las preocupaciones expresadas por el Vaticano, se encuentra la posibilidad de que las escuelas católicas privadas no estén exentas de organizar actividades durante la futura Jornada Nacional contra la Homofobia.  También manifiesta temor por la \"libertad de pensamiento\" de los católicos y por las posibles consecuencias judiciales.  \"Pedimos que se tengan en cuenta nuestras preocupaciones\", escribe la Santa Sede al Gobierno italiano, añade *Il Corriere della Sera*.\n\nEl proyecto de ley contra la homofobia y la transfobia, impulsado por el diputado del Partido Demócrata (PD) Alessandro Zan, fue aprobado en la Cámara de Diputados el pasado 4 de noviembre con 265 votos a favor y 193 en contra. Desde entonces,  a la espera de la aprobación del Senado,  se enfrenta a la férrea oposición de la derecha y la ultraderecha.\n\n\"Siempre hemos apoyado una normativa rigurosa contra la homotransfobia, y seguimos apoyando esta normativa y el proyecto de ley Zan.

{"text": "Compositional Game Theory (CGT), recently introduced [9], offers a novel approach to game representation using *open games*.  These are built compositionally from simpler games using specialized operators. Despite significant interest and development [4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14], open games remain complex. Even the simplest form is an 8-tuple, and more advanced versions [4] require sophisticated structures like coends. This complexity has several negative consequences: (i) proofs become complex and error-prone; (ii) resulting programs, mirroring the proofs, are overly complex; (iii) experimentation and innovation are stifled—the authors of [10], for example, found exploring alternative definitions prohibitive; and (iv) the underlying mathematical structure of open games remains obscured.\n\nCategory theory offers a solution to this complexity: trading complex definitions in simple categories for simpler definitions in more complex categories.  This approach simplified open games by factoring their definition through the category of lenses, and led to the discovery of Bayesian Open Games [4] by substituting lenses with optics in a monoidal category.  Such substitution is a hallmark of compositionality.  However, the current definition of open games *lacks* compositionality.  Consequently,  adaptations like open games with mixed strategies [10], which involve a seemingly minor change to the equilibrium predicate, necessitate rebuilding the entire theory.  The same holds for incorporating best-response functions, adding type dependency, allowing the play and co-play functions to reside in different categories, introducing monadic effects, or exploring numerous other variations.  Each modification requires a fresh, non-trivial demonstration that the resulting variant forms a monoidal category.\n\nWe present a compositional approach to CGT that allows localized modifications to the definition of an open game.  By verifying suitable local properties of these modifications, we can directly conclude that the resulting open games form a monoidal category.  Following the principles of compositionality, we begin with a semantic structure—a presentation of monoidal categories using profunctors and Arrows [17]—and define operators to construct complex instances from simpler ones.  This simplifies the treatment of the monoidal structure to that of a strength, enabling a purely functorial setting. While convenient, Arrows are not essential; working directly with monoidal categories is also possible.\n\nOur approach comprises a three-phase compositional axiomatization of CGT: (i) selecting an Arrow to represent the play/coplay structure; (ii) abstracting the equilibrium predicate to a bimodule over an Arrow, and defining an operator to construct new Arrows from existing ones and their bimodules; and (iii) abstracting the indexing of open games by strategies with an operator mapping graded Arrows to Arrows. This yields a simple, compositional, arrow-theoretic axiomatization of CGT.  We also demonstrate an alternative approach: introducing strategies before the equilibrium predicate, enabling the treatment of probabilistic games and games based on best-response functions.  While Hedges [14, §8] presents a related axiomatization, it is neither compositional nor sufficiently general to encompass probabilistic or dependently typed open games."}

{"text": "Rainy Roth, a children’s ministry leader in her Montana church, volunteers as a crisis counselor with Crisis Text Line.  From her computer in a small town (population 943), she connects with people, primarily under 25, who are struggling with a variety of issues. This work, she finds, intertwines with her role at church, as both involve supporting and nurturing young people.\n\nAs a crisis counselor, Rainy completed a rigorous 34-hour training program, covering topics from active listening techniques to dealing with self-harm, suicide, depression, bullying, and gender/sexual identity.  This prepared her for the challenging but rewarding work ahead.\n\nRainy’s motivation stems partly from her own childhood experience with undiagnosed anxiety.  In the 1960s, mental health awareness was limited, and her struggles were misunderstood.  Now, she finds solace in being able to tell someone, “I get it,” offering understanding and validation she lacked as a child.\n\nWhile she helps texters with various challenges, Rainy finds the “active rescues” – intervening when someone expresses imminent plans to harm themselves or others – particularly impactful.  Knowing she played a role in getting someone immediate help is profoundly rewarding. “It’s not only about saving lives,” she explains, “it’s also about letting these individuals know that people care.”\n\nA simple phrase, “You matter,” carries surprising weight for many texters.  Rainy frequently hears, “Wow, I have never heard that before!”  These two words offer reassurance and a sense of belonging, countering negative thoughts and feelings.\n\nThe connection she forms with texters is deeply fulfilling.

{"text": "The Seagoing Cowboys program offers a compelling opportunity for several reasons.  It allows you to travel the world while providing crucial aid to communities devastated by destruction. Many participants have found the experience deeply rewarding, and you likely will too.  While a yearly commitment isn't required, repeat trips are certainly possible. Be aware that participation may entail time away from family.\n\nImagine exploring places you might otherwise never have the chance to see. As the first paragraph highlights, one participant, Luke, recognized this as \"an opportunity of a lifetime.\"  Wouldn't you want to seize such a chance?  Joining the UNRRA is all it takes.\n\nUNRRA stands for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.  While the program involves work, it's work with a profound purpose.  As the second paragraph explains, responsibilities include caring for horses, calves, and mules shipped overseas.  While this might seem unpleasant at first glance, it's a vital part of helping rebuild these ravaged countries.  Remember, these animals need comfort and care as much as the people do.\n\nOne of the most appealing aspects of the program is the opportunity to visit unique locations. Paragraph five notes that Luke completed nine trips—the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.  This could be a goal for you too.  Beyond their duties, participants like Luke and Don also enjoyed leisure time, playing baseball, volleyball, and exploring the countries they visited.\n\nFinally, paragraph nine reveals the deeper impact of the experience: \"But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. 'I'm grateful for the opportunity,' he says. 'It made me more aware of other people of other countries and their needs.'\"  Let Luke's inspiring journey encourage you to become part of the UNRRA program."}
{"text": "For the last few weeks, Vachagan Tadevosyan, a 55-year-old music teacher residing in Kolkata's Armenian school, has been anxiously monitoring news from his Armenian hometown.  He's been reaching out to his global network of family and friends, concerned about the escalating conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh.  Having lived in Kolkata for two decades, Tadevosyan speaks Hindi and Bengali and expresses gratitude for the support he’s received from his Indian friends. “Today Armenia is in trouble,\" he says, his East European accent still strong. \"Nobody wants war. But it’s heartwarming to see my Indian friends call daily, checking on my family and even donating to those affected.”  He believes this support reflects the strong historical ties between India and Armenia. “Our ancestors came here centuries ago and prospered. India has always been important to Armenians.”\n\nFor centuries, India and Armenia have shared a unique relationship. Armenians, though always a small community in India, found significant economic and cultural prosperity here.  Sebouh Aslanian, a professor of modern Armenian history at UCLA, emphasizes India's historical significance for Armenians. “India in the 17th and 18th centuries is where Armenians made a fortune, which they invested in cultural endeavors like newspapers and books. The most influential and progressive Armenians lived in India.”\n\nThe earliest Armenian in India is believed to be Thomas Cana, a merchant who arrived on the Malabar Coast in 780 CE. However, it was during the Mughal era, starting in the 16th century, that Armenians gained prominence.  Akbar recognized their commercial acumen and encouraged them to settle, leading to Armenian communities in Agra, Delhi, Surat, Madras (Chennai), Murshidabad, and Calcutta (Kolkata). Remnants of their vibrant past, including churches, cemeteries, hotels, and bridges, still stand in these cities.  Several prominent figures in Akbar’s court were Armenian, including one of his wives, Mariam Zamani Begum, and his chief justice, Abdul Hai.\n\nThe English East India Company (EIC), in a 1699 letter, acknowledged the Armenians as \"the most ancient merchants of the world,\" praising their knowledge of trade routes and goods across the Mughal empire. This expertise stemmed from their far-reaching trade networks established after Ottoman and Safavid conquests in the 15th century. As historian Mesrovb Jacob Seth notes, these Armenian traders differed from Europeans, being \"birds of passage\" who traveled extensively for trade rather than establishing colonies.\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, Armenians coexisted with European colonizers in India. Their pre-existing trade networks and integration into local society sometimes posed a commercial threat to European companies. This led to agreements like the 1688 treaty between the EIC and Khwaja Phanoos Kalantar, wherein Armenians supplied goods from Bengal at a fixed profit.  Armenians played multifaceted roles in colonial India, acting as intermediaries and even military leaders. Khojah Peterus Arathoon, for example, assisted Robert Clive in negotiations with Mir Jafar, while his brother, Khojah Gregory (Gorghin Khan), later commanded Mir Qasim’s army against the British.  As Aslanian points out, this demonstrates how Armenians sometimes facilitated colonialism while also contributing to local resistance.\n\nThe Armenian diaspora, widespread across the globe, continues to hold India in high regard, not only for its economic opportunities but also for its role as a cradle of Armenian culture.  The world’s first Armenian newspaper, Azdarar (Intelligencer), was published in Madras in 1794, followed by others in Bombay and Calcutta.  Madras also witnessed the drafting of the first constitution for the Republic of Armenia and the establishment of a printing press, becoming a major center for Armenian culture.  Calcutta, too, saw significant cultural contributions, including one of the first Armenian novels.\n\nFollowing India's independence and Armenia's independence from the USSR, many Armenians left India. Today, around 100 remain, mostly in Kolkata.  The Armenian College and Philanthropic Academy (ACPA), where Tadevosyan lives, is a testament to their enduring legacy. Founded in the 18th century, it remains a center for Armenian education and culture, hosting students from around the world.\n\nAs the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh continues, Tadevosyan hopes for a peaceful resolution, perhaps with the intervention of powerful nations like India, Russia, and the US, where Armenians have historically thrived.  He expresses a desire for international recognition of Karabakh's sovereignty as a path to peace.  Online, hashtags like #IndiasupportArmenia and #IndiastandswithArmenia reflect popular support for Armenia in India, even as the Indian government maintains a cautious stance.\n\n**(Further reading suggestions placed at the end)**"}
{"text": "Colorectal cancer is highly preventable thanks to effective screening methods that enable early detection.  The current gold standard, optical colonoscopy, involves searching the colon for mucosal abnormalities like polyps.  However, thoroughly examining the entire colon surface is challenging, leading to a polyp miss rate estimated at 25% [1].\n\nColonoscopy effectiveness hinges significantly on the physician's skill, experience, vigilance, and even fatigue.  Several quality metrics help ensure high procedural standards. For instance, Withdrawal Time (the time from reaching the cecum to removing the colonoscope) correlates strongly with Adenoma Detection Rate (ADR) [6, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18].  Cecal Intubation Rate (the proportion of procedures reaching the cecum) is another key metric, ensuring adequate colon coverage.\n\nWhile these metrics are easily calculated, they provide limited procedure-specific quality data and are typically aggregated across multiple sessions.  Research suggests other factors also influence polyp detection [14], such as colonoscope movement patterns and examination style.  The hypothesis is that a superior examination style yields more informative visuals, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy.\n\nThis work introduces a novel, quantitative colonoscopy quality metric based on automated video feed analysis. This metric, computed locally in time, assesses the informational value of each video segment for colon inspection.  Because instantaneous quality is subjective and difficult to define, human annotation is impractical.  Instead, we leverage a machine learning (ML) model to build a meaningful visual representation in a fully unsupervised manner. This representation forms the basis of a metric strongly correlated with clinical outcomes.  We first learn visual representations of colonoscopy video frames using contrastive self-supervised learning.  Then, we perform cluster analysis on these representations and construct a learned aggregation of cluster assignments, creating an indicator of \"good-quality\" video segments strongly correlated with polyp detection.\n\nAlthough our approach is reminiscent of the phase detection method in [7], our focus is distinctly different.  Other studies have explored frame representation learning in colonoscopy videos, primarily for polyp-related tasks like tracking, re-identification [3, 19], and optical biopsy [20].\n\nBy measuring the duration of good-quality video segments during the withdrawal phase, we derive a new offline colonoscopy quality metric. We demonstrate a strong correlation between this metric and Polyps Per Colonoscopy (PPC).  Furthermore, we illustrate how real-time quality measurement can estimate the likelihood of polyp detection at any point during the procedure."}
{"text": "The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a revolutionary technology designed to recognize emotions. Invented by Dr. Huang, FACS aims to provide insight into the emotional states of others, potentially offering support when needed. Dr. Huang suggests its application in computer-based learning environments, raising the question of its efficacy in such a setting.\n\nThe integration of FACS into computer-based learning holds significant promise.  By recognizing student emotions, the system could enhance the learning experience. For instance, if a student appears bored, the computer, equipped with FACS, could adapt the lesson accordingly.  This aligns with Dr. Huang's prediction: \"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" This adaptability makes FACS a potentially valuable tool for enhancing computer-based education.\n\nIn conclusion, FACS is a promising technology with applications beyond simply identifying emotions. As discussed, its potential to improve computer-based learning through real-time adaptation to student emotional states is compelling.  Given that human communication relies heavily on nonverbal cues, including emotional expression, FACS offers a valuable tool for understanding and responding to these often subtle signals."}

Comunas y entidades agrarias coinciden en la gravedad de la situación, con algunas localidades ya declarando la emergencia hídrica y otras en vías de hacerlo.\n\nEn Alem, Héctor Sierjiejuk, encargado del sector de agua potable de la CELA, que presta servicio a más de 8.000 conexiones,  describe la disminución del caudal tanto de las perforaciones como de la represa ubicada en Picada Sueca, principal fuente de abastecimiento para el 70% de los socios.  Para paliar la situación, se habilitó un acueducto desde una represa cercana a la Escuela 37 hacia la principal, y se puso en marcha una perforación sobre calle Haití y Cataratas del Iguazú.  Estas acciones, sumadas a la compra de materiales para habilitar otras perforaciones, han logrado frenar parcialmente el descenso del nivel del embalse.  El presidente del Concejo Deliberante, Rubén Pineda, expresó su preocupación por la provisión de agua y los incendios diarios, anticipando la posible declaración de emergencia hídrica en el municipio y apelando a la solidaridad y al uso racional del agua.\n\nMojón Grande ya declaró la emergencia hídrica. Su intendente, Adrián Solís, calificó la situación como extrema, con cauces y reservorios tradicionales secándose y casos puntuales con carencias para el mínimo consumo humano.  El municipio ha destinado todo su equipo vial y personal a la limpieza de cauces, perforaciones para recuperar vertientes y la creación de reservorios.  La producción de la zona ya registra grandes pérdidas, con dificultades para abastecer de agua al ganado, problema que intentan mitigar con lagunas artificiales creadas con maquinaria vial.\n\nEn Arroyo del Medio, el intendente Benito Da Silva describe una realidad dual.  Mientras el poblado se abastece con una perforación y tanque sin mayores problemas, la zona rural sufre las consecuencias de la sequía.  Vertientes y reservorios se secan, obligando al municipio a auxiliar a los colonos con tanques de agua y a excavar en busca de nuevas fuentes para crear reservorios.  \n\nEl panorama generalizado es crítico, con municipios implementando medidas de emergencia para asegurar el acceso al agua potable tanto para consumo humano como para la producción.

Hedstrom seeks DNA testing to prove the goats' lineage.\n\nHedstrom believed the goats could be registered with the American Dairy Goat Association (ADGA), which tracks goat pedigrees and adds significant value to registered animals. Dayner, a goat seller at Baxter Lane Farm for approximately ten years, typically provides registration information to her clients.  While Dayner stated the father goat was registered, the *Tampa Bay Times* reported that the ADGA rejected Hedstrom’s registration application because Dayner isn't an active member.\n\nTo prove paternity, Hedstrom requested approximately 40 hair follicles from the father goat for DNA testing in a letter to Dayner in February.

{"text": "La tragedia aérea de Alianza Lima de 1987: El recuerdo imborrable de Alex Berrocal\n\nEl 8 de diciembre de 1987, una tragedia enlutó al Perú: el equipo de fútbol Alianza Lima sufrió un accidente aéreo en el mar de Ventanilla. Alex Berrocal, coordinador del plantel en ese entonces, recuerda con dolor ese día.  \"A las 8:05 de la noche me entero por el chofer que los iba a recoger, que el avión no había llegado... Ahí me entró una bilirrubina y me fui corriendo al aeropuerto”, relata a RPP Noticias.\n\nBerrocal, quien pasó de barrista a formar parte del equipo de trabajo de Alianza Lima,  asegura que por \"cosas del destino\" no viajó con el equipo.  Comenta que, a pesar de ser habitual en los viajes, en esa ocasión decidió quedarse. “Estuve con el equipo, los embarqué, pero hubo una demora de 15 minutos, en ese ínterin me salgo de la delegación y le digo al profesor Marcos Calderón que me quedaba”.\n\nEn el aeropuerto Jorge Chávez, la incertidumbre se transformó en angustia. “A las 9:05 nos dijeron que el avión se había perdido... Ya a la una de la mañana nos dijeron que se había caído”. La noticia fue devastadora. El Fokker F-27, alquilado para el viaje a Pucallpa tras la victoria 1-0 contra Deportivo Pucallpa con gol de Carlos Bustamante, se había estrellado.\n\nDe vuelta en el Estadio de Alianza Lima, Berrocal se encontró con una escena desgarradora: cerca de 20 mil hinchas se congregaron para expresar su dolor y apoyo. \"A los hinchas se les podría ver ya desde tres cuadras del estadio... Tuvimos que abrir las puertas esperando más noticias... El presidente autorizó que se prendan las luces y que se abran los baños\", recuerda.  Incluso el presidente Agustín Merino, quien llegó a las 5 de la mañana, se sorprendió de la presencia de Berrocal.\n\nLa tragedia golpeó fuertemente a Berrocal, quien perdió a amigos como Daniel Reyes, ‘Pechito’ Farfán y Luis Escobar. Un encuentro con la madre de Escobar lo marcó profundamente: “¿Qué haces acá? Has abandonado a tus amigos”, le recriminó la mujer.  Berrocal tuvo la difícil misión de reconocer los cuerpos en la Base Naval.  “Le pedí al jefe por lo menos un poco de respeto...  Yo sabía que estaban muertos, pero les dije que para ustedes es rutina pero para nosotros no”,  compartió sobre la experiencia.\n\nAlianza Lima se perfilaba como campeón de 1987 bajo la dirección de Marcos Calderón.  El equipo contaba con figuras como Carlos ‘Caíco’ Gonzalez Ganoza, Tomás ‘Pechito’ Farfán, Daniel Reyes y Alfredo Tomassini, promesas de la Selección Peruana.  Destacaba también la joven dupla de Luis Escobar y Braulio Tejada, de quien Berrocal recuerda: “Si Escobar era un extraordinario jugador, Braulio iba a ser dos veces más extraordinario”.\n\nBerrocal también recuerda una anécdota con Marcos Calderón, quien le aconsejó dejar la barra para dedicarse de lleno al equipo.  \"Cuando el equipo no jugaba bien, la barra se iba con todo... Me acuerdo que un lunes el ‘Oso’ llegó a la oficina y me dijo ‘¿Alex somos amigos o no?’”. Este consejo lo marcó profundamente.\n\nBerrocal planea regresar a Ventanilla para homenajear a las víctimas, recordando la estrofa de la canción de Polo Campos: \"Frente al mar de Ventanilla de derrumbó una esperanza.

{"text": "The Face on Mars: Natural or Artificial?\n\nThe \"Face on Mars\" has sparked much debate, raising the question: is it a natural landform or an alien creation?  Let's explore this intriguing phenomenon.  Some believe it's evidence of extraterrestrial life, while others, myself included, maintain it's a natural occurrence.  Similar, though smaller-scale, formations exist on Earth, and we readily accept their natural origins.  Just as we see faces or objects in cloud formations without attributing them to aliens, the Martian face could be a similar illusion.\n\nMy skepticism stems from the existence of comparable formations on Earth, none of which are considered alien-made.  We routinely perceive familiar shapes in random patterns, whether in clouds or elsewhere.  The only real difference between these earthly phenomena and the face on Mars is location.\n\nThe Easter Island heads offer another interesting comparison. These massive statues bear a resemblance to the Martian face, and they, too, have been subject to theories of extraterrestrial involvement.  Ultimately, whether one believes in their alien origin is a matter of opinion, not fact.  Currently, there's no definitive proof either way regarding the Face on Mars.\n\nHowever, compelling evidence points towards a natural explanation."}

{"text": "Venus, often called the \"Evening Star,\" presents a compelling target for scientific exploration despite its extreme dangers.  While previous unmanned missions have met with limited success, surviving only a few hours after landing, the potential rewards of understanding this planet outweigh the risks.\n\nThe primary motivation for studying Venus lies in its similarity to Earth.  As the closest planet with some Earth-like characteristics, astronomers believe Venus may have once harbored oceans and potentially even life.  Paragraph 4 highlights this, stating, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may have once been the most earth-like planet in our solar system.\" This potential for past habitability makes Venus a crucial subject for research, offering insights into Earth's own evolution and the conditions necessary for life.  NASA's interest stems from a desire to understand the degree of this relatability and what caused Venus to evolve so differently.\n\nHowever, the challenges of exploring Venus are significant.  Its thick atmosphere, composed of 97% carbon dioxide and clouds of corrosive sulfuric acid, creates a hostile environment.  Surface temperatures averaging over 800 degrees Fahrenheit further compound the difficulty, as described in paragraph 3.  These dangers explain the short lifespan of previous missions and the apprehension of scientists.\n\nYet, the potential knowledge gained from studying Venus justifies the inherent risks.

Hate breeds hate, but eventually, we may see the light and understand that love and sacrifice are the true answers.\n\nThe hallmarks of great men and women are hard work, disciplined pursuit of knowledge, and a caring heart for all. Be kind, cherish your friendships, and cultivate inner change. It may be challenging, but it’s never too late to transform.  My deepest hope is that we can all learn to embrace love and beauty, and recognize that hope remains for every one of us."}
{"text": "El miedo y el respeto se entrelazaban en mi interior. Intenté convertirme en ella, habitar su estudio, visualizarla creando. Fui su pincel, pero también sentí la necesidad de pedirle permiso. Así lo confesó la bailaora y coreógrafa Rocío Molina minutos después de haber zapateado, doblado y transformado el óleo de 200 x 180 centímetros pintado por Lita Cabellut para el cartel de la 21ª Bienal de Flamenco de Sevilla, que se celebrará en septiembre de 2020.\n\nLa imponente sala de la fundación mayor de la Real Fábrica de Artillería de Sevilla, un espacio de columnas y bóvedas conocido como \"la catedral\", albergó este lunes un acontecimiento artístico singular: una *performance* de 50 minutos en la que Rocío Molina, una de las creadoras más audaces y aclamadas del flamenco, \"deconstruyó\" una obra de Lita Cabellut, una de las artistas españolas más cotizadas en el mercado internacional, en lo que esta última denomina \"un ejercicio de libertad\".\n\nRocío Molina (Torre del Mar, Málaga, 35 años) entró con cautela y rodeó la tela, previamente extendida sobre un suelo acústico por ambas artistas. Durante más de 10 minutos la observó, hasta que finalmente se atrevió a posar un pie sobre la figura de una bailaora morena, vestida de rojo, que parecía moverse sobre un fondo negro iluminado tan solo por una pequeña ventana.  Con sus botas de tacón, zapateó incansable y sin música, marcando el compás con palmas y chasquidos de dedos, bajo la mirada emocionada y aprobatoria de Lita Cabellut (Sariñena, Huesca, 58 años). \"Compungida, pero no por dolor, sino por amor\", precisó la artista. \"Cada paso de Rocío evocaba mis pinceladas, revivía el doloroso proceso de creación.  Esa atención, esas horas de trabajo, son la herencia del lienzo, permanecen y se perciben incluso en la obra deconstruida\", explicó la pintora gitana residente en La Haya (Países Bajos), quien aceptó sin dudar el encargo del director de la Bienal de Flamenco, Antonio Zoido.\n\n[Insertar imagen: Desde la izquierda, Rocío Molina, Lita Cabellut y Tía Juana la del Pipa tras la 'performance' que han realizado este lunes en Sevilla. Paco Puentes]\n\n\"Solo les puse una condición: quería un cartel con dos caras, la tradición y la renovación. Por un lado, la pintura original; por el otro, esa misma pintura deconstruida, algo que, por primera vez, otro artista ha hecho por mí. El resultado es maravilloso, como un cristal frente a la obra que se ha agrietado, ha vibrado y se ha fragmentado\", explicó la pintora al describir el estado final de su óleo, una pieza matérica con doce capas de pintura que se craquela con facilidad gracias a la imprimación especial de la tela.  El encuentro contó con una tercera participante: la cantaora jerezana Tía Juana la del Pipa, quien interpretó a capela una seguiriya que culminó en toná.\n\n\"Llevo 45 años pintando y domino mi oficio; por eso, hace dos años, quise ir más allá, donde el tiempo y la técnica no son lo primordial, sino la esencia del arte\", explicó Cabellut, quien el pasado 5 de octubre ofreció una conferencia en el Museo del Prado y, por primera vez, realizó el proceso de deconstrucción ante el público.  \"Fue como desnudarme, porque, como la mayoría de los artistas, soy muy celosa de mi intimidad, de mi proceso creativo.  Pero esto ha sido diferente. Rocío me ha brindado la oportunidad de confiar en otra artista, de compartir\", aseguró Cabellut. Tras la *performance*, que se grabó para el vídeo promocional de la Bienal, la emoción la embargó, afloraron las lágrimas y se fundió en un abrazo con la bailaora."}
{"text": "Deep Learning has achieved remarkable success in various AI domains like Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Robotics. However, its application to tabular data, despite its widespread use in various institutions and industries (e.g., banking, clinical, commercial), remains relatively unexplored.  As [2] reports, over 65% of datasets in the Google Dataset Search platform are tabular (CSV or XLS).  Financial transactions, representing time-dependent sequences of client activities, are a particularly relevant example.  Yet, predictive tasks in this domain often rely on pre-Deep Learning methods like Gradient Boosted Decision Trees [1, 3, 4].\n\nTwo key challenges hinder Deep Learning's progress with tabular data. The first is the scarcity of large-scale public datasets due to commercial or privacy restrictions, particularly in finance.  The second is the inherent heterogeneity of tabular data. Unlike images (numerical pixel values) or text (categorical words), tables mix numerical (e.g., transaction amount) and categorical features (e.g., transaction type, receiver category).  This heterogeneity complicates representation and training, raising questions about joint feature representation and appropriate objective functions.  Further complicating matters is the need to represent time sequences with variable internal structures. For example, a Point Of Sale (POS) transaction contains location data absent in other transaction types within the same account history.\n\nThis paper introduces UniTTab, a Unified Transformer for Time-Dependent Heterogeneous Tabular Data, addressing these challenges with a novel architecture. Inspired by TabBERT [6] and hierarchical approaches in video processing [7], UniTTab employs a two-level hierarchy. The first level embeds individual tabular rows (e.g., a single transaction), while the second level processes sequences of these rows. This structure effectively represents time series exceeding one hundred rows.\n\nSeveral key innovations differentiate UniTTab from existing hierarchical models. First, a type-dependent embedding interface connects the hierarchy's two levels, projecting different row types (e.g., POS vs. ATM transactions) into fixed-dimension vectors. This novel approach tackles the challenge of time series comprising structurally diverse rows.\n\nSecond, inspired by numerical representations in NeRFs [8] for 3D synthesis, UniTTab represents numerical values as feature vectors concatenating various frequency functions.  This addresses deep networks' bias towards learning low-frequency functions [9] and captures the high-frequency variations in tabular data fields. This encoding is distinct from positional encoding in Transformers [5], focusing on field *value* rather than *position*.\n\nThird, UniTTab utilizes a unified objective function based on the Masked Token pretext task [10], eliminating the need for loss-specific weights.  For numerical features, inspired by BEiT [11] and discrete VAEs [12], we quantize numerical features into bins and use these quantized values as target tokens during self-supervised training."}

{"text": "This manuscript introduces a novel dual-port grid-forming (GFM) control strategy for Modular Multilevel Converters (MMCs) in hybrid AC/DC grids.  The increasing integration of renewable generation, energy storage, and HVDC transmission necessitates advanced converter control strategies to address the challenges posed by reduced system inertia and the changing dynamics of power systems.  Existing control strategies, categorized as grid-following (GFL) or grid-forming (GFM), have limitations. GFL controls rely on stable AC voltage, while conventional GFM controls, despite providing frequency control, require stable DC voltage.  Furthermore, in HVDC systems, existing VSC controls require stable AC voltage for DC voltage stabilization. This interdependency necessitates assigning specific AC-GFM or DC-GFM roles to different Interconnecting Power Converters (IPCs), complicating system operation and vulnerability.\n\nThe proposed dual-port GFM control overcomes these limitations by simultaneously forming the voltage on both the AC and DC terminals of the MMC, leveraging the inherent energy storage capabilities of the MMC. This approach eliminates the need to assign dedicated AC- or DC-GFM roles to different IPCs, simplifying system control and enhancing resilience.  Unlike existing single-port GFM controls that operate either as AC-GFM or DC-GFM, controlling the MMC's internal energy through GFL control on the other terminal, the dual-port GFM control manages energy through both terminals.  This innovative approach allows the system to withstand line and generator outages on either the AC or DC network, significantly improving overall system reliability.\n\nTwo distinct dual-port GFM MMC control strategies are presented, along with guidelines for parameter selection.  Small-signal stability analysis for a simplified test system is provided to demonstrate the key features of the proposed controls.  Comprehensive high-fidelity simulation studies validate the analytical results, compare the performance of dual-port GFM controls against traditional single-port GFM controls, and demonstrate the operation of a grid of grids using dual-port GFM control.\n\nThe manuscript is structured as follows: Section II outlines the problem setup, objectives, and terminology. Section III reviews standard MMC models and control strategies. Section IV provides a critical review of existing single-port GFM MMC controls. Section V introduces the novel dual-port GFM controls, which constitute the main contribution of this work.  Section VI presents the analytical small-signal stability results. Section VII details the simulation studies and performance comparisons. Section VIII discusses the proposed controls and compares them with existing state-of-the-art methods.  Finally, Section IX concludes the manuscript and outlines future research directions.\n\n\nThis work was supported by the ICREA Academia program (Oriol Gomis-Bellmunt), the Serra Húnter Lecturer program (Eduardo Prieto-Araujo), and FEDER / Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades -Agencia Estatal de Investigación, Project RTI2018-095429-B-I00."}
{"text": "The Time I Accidentally Kickstarted Armageddon (Or, How I Spent My Summer Vacation)\n\nBy Danny Carriveaux\nAP English\nSeptember 2, 2015\nMrs. Gundrum\n\nMy summer was shaping up to be pretty dull.  Subway sandwiches by day, saving for college by night.  My only escapes were hanging with my friends at the skate park or hitting house parties. Those were usually pretty sweet. One July night, a party yielded zero girls, so I headed home, fired up my laptop, and clicked around online. I stumbled across what I thought was a Kickstarter for Food For Sherman, one of my favorite bands. They were trying to fund their new album.  No one had pledged yet, so I figured I’d be the first. Five bucks – done. Then I crashed.\n\nI woke up to four dudes looming over me. The tallest, decked out in some seriously impressive blood-red armor, boomed, “Daniel Carriveaux, arise and assume your mantle as harbinger of mankind’s destruction!” Or something like that.\n\n“What?” I mumbled, completely bewildered.\n\nHe explained that they were the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, waiting for an invitation to, you know, end the world. And I’d just RSVP’d them with my five-dollar donation.  I told War I thought I was supporting a band.  He sighed, “We know. We thought it’d be more popular.”  He then showed me the Kickstarter page. Sure enough, the five-dollar reward: unleashing the Four Horsemen and overseeing the annihilation of mankind, culminating in the final battle between good and evil.\n\n“Sounds epic,” I said, “but first things first.  You guys gotta cover my shift at Subway. I’m hungover.”  Not my brightest idea.  The moment Famine walked through the door, every sub rotted, and anyone mid-sandwich got instant food poisoning, courtesy of Death. Pestilence violated every health code imaginable, and War got into a brawl with my manager, resulting in my termination.  They relayed this news an hour later at my house, eager to start the real work – the killing, the disease, the starvation, the whole shebang.  I told them to chill. Not really my scene.\n\nInstead, we hung out, and I took them to parties.  The girls thought it was cool hanging with the Four Horsemen…until they started violently puking, thanks to Pestilence.  The horses were a bit conspicuous, so I got them into skateboarding.  We became the Five Shredders of the Apocalypse: War, Death, Famine, Pestilence, and Chill (that’s me). They were still pretty keen on the whole humanity-destruction thing, so I had to keep them on a tight leash.  Luckily, I got them hooked on *Breaking Bad*.  Netflix and chill became our thing, and they actually turned out to be pretty decent dudes.\n\nThen, a week before school started, we were skating when the ground started shaking. I thought it was an earthquake, but then everything went black…and bright at the same time.  Stroke like Grandpa? Nope. Turns out I was surrounded by angels and demons.  On one side, the devil, in this weird flowing robe, holding a sword and looking vaguely feminine, backed by thousands of demons ready to rumble like something out of *Lord of the Rings*.  On the other, bathed in light, Jesus Christ (who looked nothing like the stained-glass version), leading an army of white-clad, winged, haloed, spear-wielding angels.\n\nJesus and Satan stepped forward, staring at me and the Horsemen in stunned silence. Finally, I broke the awkwardness. “Hi, I’m Danny. These are my boys."}

While Venus shares some similarities with Earth, its vastly different environment poses significant challenges to any potential mission.\n\nThe author correctly theorizes that a Venus expedition would be immensely difficult and time-consuming, primarily due to the planet's extreme atmospheric conditions.  As noted in the text, \"On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\"  These extreme temperatures and crushing atmospheric pressure present substantial dangers to any probe or spacecraft.\n\nEven 30 miles above the surface, conditions remain hostile, with temperatures around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, albeit with lower pressure.  A potential benefit of a Venus mission is the possibility of discovering evidence of past or present life, given some historical comparisons and theories about the planet. However, sample collection presents a formidable obstacle.  Anything approaching the surface risks melting, questioning the value of a mission where meaningful study might be impossible, limited perhaps to distant images and video from high altitude.  Without significant technological advancements to withstand the extreme Venusian environment, the ability to conduct robust scientific research remains severely limited.\n\nThese extreme conditions explain NASA's hesitation to explore Venus.

{"text": "Generating 3D-aware images has recently garnered significant interest [3, 30, 36]. A promising approach involves integrating a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) [28] into a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) [7]. This integration replaces the traditional 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) generator with a generative implicit function. This function maps raw 3D coordinates to point-wise densities and colors, conditioned on a given latent code, effectively encoding the image's structure and texture in 3D space.\n\nHowever, directly using NeRF [28] as a generator presents two key challenges. First, NeRF's implicit function utilizes a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network to determine color and density for each 3D point.  Due to the MLP's very local receptive field, it struggles to represent the global underlying structure during image synthesis. Consequently, relying solely on 3D coordinates as input [3, 30, 36] limits the generator's expressiveness and its ability to leverage global structural information.\n\nSecond, the volume rendering process generates pixel values for the output image independently by sampling numerous points along each pixel's camera ray."}

{"text": "The allure of traditional driving lies in the intimate connection between driver and machine.  Much like understanding the nuances of a pet, drivers appreciate the unique characteristics of their cars. This connection is especially important for brands like BMW, which prioritize driving experience, or Mercedes-Benz, known for its focus on comfort.  The development of driverless cars threatens this personalized experience, potentially homogenizing the automotive market and erasing the unique brand identities cultivated by manufacturers. This raises a crucial question: if driverless cars still require driver intervention, can they truly be called \"driverless\"?\n\nThe current limitations of driverless technology underscore this point. These systems are not yet fully autonomous and require driver oversight due to their inability to handle unexpected situations. For instance, as highlighted in BMW's 2013 announcement of their \"Traffic Jam Assistant,\" while the car can manage driving functions at low speeds, the driver must remain engaged.  Furthermore, at higher speeds, the automatic braking system may not react quickly enough to sudden obstacles, like a pedestrian unexpectedly entering the roadway. This inherent safety risk, coupled with the need for constant driver vigilance, undermines the very concept of driverless technology.\n\nWhile some may argue that driverless cars offer convenience, many find joy in the active participation of driving.  This enjoyment stems from the dynamic interaction between driver and vehicle, a feeling of control and connection that is lost in the passive experience of autonomous travel."}

The author champions the study of this planet primarily due to its similarities to Earth and its proximity to us, making it the closest option for planetary visitation. The article notes, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.\"  This past similarity makes Venus a unique window into potential evolutionary pathways for Earth-like planets. Further reinforcing this connection, the article highlights Venus's familiar geological features: \"the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.\"\n\nThe author argues that the inherent dangers of exploring Venus should not deter us.  They advocate for pushing the boundaries of human exploration, stating, \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by danger and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\"  This commitment to exploration is echoed in ongoing research efforts: \"Many researchers are working on innovations that allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.\"  These efforts demonstrate a determination to overcome the technological hurdles presented by Venus’s hostile environment.\n\nNASA shares this interest in Venusian exploration.  The article mentions, \"NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus... [a] possible solution to the hostile conditions.\""}
{"text": "The dangers of Venus include gravity, temperature, and air pressure.  The author uses the example of a hovering vehicle, likely a rover, in paragraph five to illustrate the gravitational challenges.  The text explains, \"Just like jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.\" This suggests the vehicle would struggle to remain on the surface.  Furthermore, the intense temperature poses a significant threat.  As stated in paragraph five, the temperature on Venus is \"around 170 degrees Fahrenheit,\" which is scorching.

{"text": "Speech separation, addressing the \"cocktail party problem,\" aims to isolate target speech from background interference [1].  While conventional techniques include computational auditory scene analysis [2], non-negative matrix factorization [3, 4], HMM-GMM [5, 6], and minimum mean square error [7], deep learning has recently emerged as the dominant approach [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] and is the focus of this paper.  Deep learning-based speech separation can be categorized into speaker-dependent [14], target-dependent, and speaker-independent approaches, based on prior knowledge of speaker information.  Speaker-dependent methods, requiring prior information for all speakers, have limited practical application. Current research primarily focuses on speaker-independent and target-dependent techniques.\n\nSpeaker-independent methods face a speaker permutation ambiguity problem.  Two primary solutions exist: deep clustering [15, 16, 17], which projects time-frequency units into higher-dimensional embedding vectors for clustering; and permutation invariant training [18, 19, 20], which selects the speaker permutation with the minimum training error.\n\nTarget-dependent methods leverage prior knowledge of the target speaker. Early methods trained a model for each target speaker [21], limiting practicality. Speaker extraction methods address this by incorporating speaker codes from a speaker recognition system as network input [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28].  For example, [29] uses a context adaptive deep neural network with a speaker adaptation layer, while [23] proposes a temporal spectrum approximation loss for phase-sensitive mask estimation.  [30] extends end-to-end speaker-independent separation [31] to speaker extraction.\n\nThese methods, primarily single-channel, perform well in clean environments but struggle with reverberation."}
{"text": "Students often experience a range of emotions – anger, sadness, boredom, confusion – that significantly impact their ability to learn and engage in the classroom. These emotions can stem from issues both inside and outside of school, and teachers, while dedicated, aren't always equipped to identify and address these complex emotional states. A Facial Action Coding System (FACS) offers a potential solution.  This technology can detect subtle facial expressions indicative of these emotions, alerting educators to a student's emotional state.\n\nCurrently, even when teachers strive to provide the best possible instruction, students may still struggle due to unaddressed emotional needs. A student might be confused by the material, bored by the presentation, or preoccupied with personal issues.  FACS can bridge this gap by identifying these otherwise hidden struggles. As outlined in the source article, FACS can recognize boredom and confusion, allowing for real-time lesson adjustments, much like a skilled human instructor would adapt their approach based on student feedback.\n\nImplementing FACS has the potential to revolutionize the school system.  It moves beyond simply delivering information and focuses on the holistic well-being of the student.  By recognizing signs of sadness or anger, the system can prompt educators to check in with students and offer support."}

While she’s experienced many different years in the classroom, nothing compares to this year, where her students are all learning online.  She pursued teaching because she wanted to make a difference, especially for students facing challenges. “One of the reasons I got into it is because I had some struggles growing up that weren’t noticed. I looked like a good student and had a great family but I had some struggles, and so that always gave me a sensitivity for kids to work past the outward appearance and help kids learn how great they can be,” Ferretti explains.\n\nThis week's student nominator, Nora Marsh, acknowledges the difficulties of online learning and teaching but highlights Mrs. Ferretti's ability to inspire her students to overcome these challenges.  “You have to do a lot of stuff with the computer, and you have to stay home and not flip your lid. That’s what she tells us, don’t flip your lid. And I think she does a really great job,” says Marsh."}

Developed by Ciaran, an electrical engineering PhD graduate from NUI Galway with a strong entrepreneurial spirit and a background in suckler farming in Strokestown, County Roscommon, Herdeye merges his scientific expertise with his firsthand understanding of farming’s challenges.\n\nCiaran recognizes the significant time commitment farmers dedicate to monitoring calving cameras.  He explains, \"This isn't like any other product on the market. Its vision system uses artificial intelligence to identify and monitor each cow for signs of calving behavior. By tracking these tell-tale signs, the system predicts calving and alerts the farmer via smartphone to any potential difficulties.\"  Ciaran developed Herdeye with Mark McGann and Aaron Signorelli.\n\nHe adds, \"Another benefit is the system's ability to monitor multiple animals simultaneously and track calving progress in real-time.\"  Given the current focus on calf care, Ciaran believes Herdeye will improve animal welfare by providing farmers with real-time updates on the calving process and alerts when intervention is necessary.  \"There's less risk of injury to the calf or cow because the system alerts farmers at every stage.  This also saves farmers valuable time, freeing them from constant camera monitoring to attend to other farm tasks.\"\n\nSimplicity was a key design principle.  Herdeye operates on its own data system, eliminating the need for Wi-Fi and requiring only a good signal.  “The price will be competitive with similar products on the market,” notes Ciaran.\n\nHerdeye's innovation has garnered industry recognition, winning the Best Newcomer award at the Local Enterprise Office (LEO) Innovation Arena at the National Ploughing Championships and receiving a feasibility study grant from the Roscommon LEO."}

{"text": "Functional data analysis (FDA) has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by our increasing ability to capture and analyze near-continuous data streams [9, 11, 15, 24, 27].  FDA treats these data streams as continuous functions within a metric function space, leveraging the space's geometry for statistical analysis. This approach offers clear advantages over traditional discrete time-series analysis.  However, analyzing functional data presents challenges due to the infinite dimensionality of function spaces, noise contamination, and, importantly, phase variability.\n\nPhase variability, a unique characteristic of functional data, refers to the horizontal shifting of peaks and valleys within observed functions due to time-axis warpings.  This horizontal, or compositional, noise, distinct from vertical/additive noise, reflects a lack of temporal synchronization. For instance, COVID-19 infection rates peak at different times across regions, indicating varying viral evolution rates.  Ignoring phase variability can lead to inflated variance, loss of structure, and reduced statistical power [19, 20, 23, 27, 28, 29].  Existing methods aim to separate phase and amplitude components (alignment or registration) before analysis [14, 17, 23, 27, 30]. While these methods differ in their specifics, they share a common limitation: the assumption of fully observed functions over a shared interval with perfectly matched endpoints.\n\nMathematically, given observed functions {f i : [0, T ] → R, i = 1, 2, . . . , n}, isolating phase variability involves finding time-warping functions {γ i } such that the time-warped functions {f i • γ i } are aligned (peaks and valleys co-located).  These warping functions are diffeomorphisms of [0, T ] to itself, constrained by γ i (0) = 0 and γ i (T ) = T. This constraint implies the assumption of pre-matched endpoints {f i (0)} and {f i (T )}.\n\nHowever, this boundary matching assumption often fails when phase variability affects boundaries, limiting current analytical approaches.  While left boundaries {f i (0)} might be synchronized (e.g., through a simple shift), right boundaries often remain variable.  This occurs in COVID-19 data, where infection curves at the end of the observation period reflect different evolutionary stages.  Another example is censored data, where observation intervals are randomly truncated [4, 7].\n\nWhile a significant body of work addresses right-censored functional data, particularly in survival analysis [13, 16], it typically focuses on modeling censoring times without considering phase variability [4, 7]. These methods assume perfect registration and thus perform poorly when phase variability is present.  A naive solution involves linearly scaling observations to a common domain [0, T ], but this fails to address the underlying issues stemming from phase variability at the boundaries."}

For every $(o, l) \\in L_+ \\times L_-$, $L_o$ denotes a linear (possibly unbounded) operator, $\\Psi_l^{u_{l_o}}$ represents the nonlinearity, and $V_l$ the potential or noise. Precise assumptions on the operator $L_o$, the nonlinearity $\\Psi_l^{u_{l_o}}$, and the potential $V_l$ are stated in Section [section number]. We impose initial conditions $u_o(0) = v_o$ and, when $\\partial\\Omega \\neq \\emptyset$, suitable boundary conditions encoded in the domain of the operator $L_o$.\n\nEvolution equations of type (1) have been extensively studied in numerical analysis, and various time discretization techniques have been proposed, including splitting methods, exponential integrators, Runge-Kutta schemes, and Lawson-type schemes [references]. While these classical methods effectively approximate smooth solutions, they often struggle with low regularity data. Rough data and high oscillations generally lead to a severe loss of convergence and increased computational costs, hindering reliable approximations.  Nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) at low regularity remain a significant challenge in numerical analysis.\n\nThis work introduces a general framework for low regularity integrators to approximate the time dynamics of (1) to arbitrarily high order under weaker regularity assumptions than required by classical methods like Runge-Kutta, splitting, exponential integrators, or Lawson schemes.  Our framework significantly extends the recent work in [reference], which was restricted to dispersive equations with periodic boundary conditions and polynomial nonlinearities of the form $u^{m}$.  We overcome the limitations of periodic boundary conditions and encompass a broader class of equations, including parabolic, hyperbolic, and dispersive problems.

{"text": "Predicting age and gender has become a prominent field in deep learning, driven by the increasing volume of images uploaded online. While humans easily recognize each other and often make judgments about gender and ethnicity, accurately estimating age remains a challenge.  This difficulty is highlighted by the standard evaluation metric, mean absolute error (MAE). Studies show that humans have a MAE of 7.2-7.4 years when predicting the age of individuals over 15, meaning their predictions are off by this amount on average.  Can we develop automated systems that surpass human performance in this task?\n\nThe challenge stems from the complex factors influencing facial aging.  Beyond genetics, lifestyle, expressions, and environment play significant roles [1].  Consequently, individuals of the same age can appear vastly different. This inherent complexity is compounded by the scarcity of large, balanced, and accurately labeled datasets.  Existing datasets are often imbalanced, concentrating on the 20-75 age range [3]-[5] or exhibiting gender bias.  Using such biased data is detrimental, creating a distribution mismatch with real-world images during testing and leading to poor performance.\n\nDespite these challenges, the field holds immense potential, sparking growing interest due to its wide applicability in areas like human-computer interaction (HCI).  Potential applications span forensics, law enforcement [1], security control [1], and even integration with IoT devices. Imagine a restaurant dynamically adjusting its ambiance based on the estimated average age or gender of its patrons.\n\nThis paper explores these possibilities and is structured as follows: Section 2 provides background on previous work in this field and our motivations. Section 3 details the technical aspects of our project, divided into three subsections. Section 4 describes the evaluation metrics employed.  Section 5 presents our experiments and results, and Section 6 concludes with a summary and directions for future work."}

(©Hervine Mahaud/Lille Actu)\n\nLes fans de l'univers Disney vont être enchantés !  Depuis début juillet, la boutique Maison Francal, installée au pied de la Vieille Bourse à Lille, propose des bougies parfumées à l'effigie de Mickey, Simba ou encore Winnie l'Ourson. L’enseigne, dont les ateliers sont situés dans la métropole lilloise, vient également de lancer sa propre ligne, « Les Souvenirs de Garance », avec une esthétique rétro et un clin d’œil aux villes les plus emblématiques de France.  Conçues et fabriquées en France, ces bougies haut de gamme sont à la fois des objets de décoration et de collection.\n\n\nDu packaging de luxe à la bougie parfumée\n\nRien ne prédestinait pourtant cette entreprise nordiste, fondée à Lesquin en 1987, à se lancer dans la confection de bougies à l'effigie des héros Disney.  À l'origine, Maison Francal était spécialisée dans le packaging. « Nous avions un modèle économique unique et nous étions spécialisés dans les emballages de luxe, les sacs et les boîtes que nous fabriquions pour différentes marques », explique Geoffrey Marcant, dirigeant du groupe Francal, dont les ateliers sont basés à Marcq-en-Baroeul.\n\nArrivé dans la société en 2011 pour succéder à son père, Geoffrey Marcant fait une rencontre déterminante en 2015 : « Un cirier qui cherchait un fabricant de packaging.  Passionné par ce produit, je m’y suis intéressé. Il m’a formé au métier de la bougie et ce fut une révélation ! »  Le dirigeant intègre alors les bougies parfumées à son catalogue professionnel. Il faudra cependant attendre encore un peu avant de voir apparaître les premiers modèles Mickey destinés au grand public.\n\n[Cliquez ici pour visualiser le contenu]\n\nDétenteur d’une licence Disney depuis 2000, le groupe Francal est invité chaque année à une convention organisée par la multinationale pour ses licenciés. Celle de 2016 marque un tournant pour Geoffrey Marcant, qui y apprend deux informations cruciales : «  Ils nous ont annoncé que 75 % des produits Disney sont achetés par des adultes, pour des adultes. Et que le secteur en plein essor était celui de la décoration d’intérieur. »  Geoffrey Marcant pense immédiatement aux bougies. « J’ai commencé à étudier l’offre de produits dérivés Disney et il n’y avait quasiment aucune bougie parfumée. Je me suis demandé comment ils avaient pu passer à côté ! »  L’entreprise saisit l’opportunité et lance sa première collection de bougies Disney en septembre 2017.\n\nÀ lire aussi : Ouverture de la boutique Harry Potter à Euralille : les premiers clients sont enchantés\n\nLes fans de Disney collectionnent les bougies\n\nPour leur confection, Geoffrey Marcant s’est entouré d’artisans français talentueux.

{"text": "The Impaired Federal Response to January 6th: A Failure of Leadership\n\nThe explosive riots of January 6th exposed critical deficiencies in the federal response, leaving battered Capitol Police, including the late Officer Brian Sicknick and 140 injured officers, waiting over three hours for reinforcements from the Pentagon and National Guard.  This delayed response has prompted intense scrutiny, with officials deflecting blame and struggling to explain how rioters breached the Capitol so easily. As Senator Amy Klobuchar aptly observed, “The failures are obvious… ‘Does anybody have a plan?’ Sadly, no one did.”\n\nWhile analyses have explored the role of intelligence failures, competing testimonies from former Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Justice (DOJ) officials obscure a fundamental question: who was in charge?  While some have noted the chaos stemming from this lack of clear leadership, a crucial point has been overlooked:  senior Army officials’ statements indicating that this leadership vacuum significantly hampered the protection of the Capitol.  This analysis will examine the publicly available information regarding the designated lead federal agency for January 6th and the consequences of its apparent absence.\n\nThe Murky Question of Leadership on January 6th\n\nImmediately following the attack, the DOD indicated its understanding that the DOJ was the lead federal agency responsible for security preparations and response on January 6th. This understanding was reiterated by then-Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller, then-Secretary of the Army Ryan D. McCarthy, and Army Chief of Staff General James McConville in their Congressional testimonies.\n\nHowever, former Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen denied this assertion, maintaining that the DOJ’s role was limited to intelligence coordination and information sharing.  This discrepancy led Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz to lament the difficulty in determining who was ultimately responsible, highlighting the adage that when everyone is in charge, no one is.\n\nSeveral explanations have been offered for this confusion.  One possibility is that the DOD, based on precedent and internal policies assigning the Attorney General responsibility for leading military responses to domestic civil disturbances, presumed the DOJ’s leadership."}

{"text": "The claim that this image depicts a face on Mars is difficult for me to accept.  The evidence presented relies on photographs taken by a machine, not direct human observation. While scientists suggest it's the remnant of an alien structure, their conclusion lacks proof of extraterrestrial existence. If they can capture an image of this supposed \"face,\" why not an image of the aliens themselves?\n\nThe \"face\" could easily be a surface irregularity, with lighting creating a pareidolia effect – the tendency to perceive meaningful patterns in random stimuli.  The lack of a close-up image from a manned mission fuels this skepticism.  The resemblance to a human face, rather than a deformed creature, further deepens my doubts.  Scientists labeling this an \"alien artifact\" seems premature, especially given the absence of confirmed alien encounters.\n\nThe image itself raises questions. The shadowed right side suggests the shape could simply be a product of the lighting conditions. A ring-like formation at the bottom further complicates the \"face\" interpretation.  Scientists haven't provided a clear basis for their alien artifact claim, especially since they lack confirmed knowledge of what aliens look like. The absence of any comparative alien imagery within the article weakens their argument.  While scientists likely have their reasons for this conclusion, the available evidence points more towards a natural formation than an alien artifact.  Without concrete proof of alien existence and closer examination, the \"face on Mars\" remains unconvincing."}

{"text": "## African Football Stars Shine in UEFA Competitions\n\nThe UEFA Champions League and Europa League group stages kick off this week, with a strong African contingent ready to make their mark.  This is a perfect opportunity to revisit the continent's top performers in these prestigious tournaments, exploring their impressive records and achievements.\n\n**Most Appearances in UEFA Club Football**\n\n* **113 – Samuel Eto'o (Cameroon)**\n\nTeams: Real Madrid, Mallorca, Barcelona, Internazionale, Anji Makhachkala, Chelsea, Everton\n\nEto'o holds the record for most UEFA club competition appearances by an African player.  Ironically, despite his strong association with Barcelona, he debuted for Real Madrid and later represented Mallorca in the Champions League.  The prolific striker lifted the coveted trophy twice with Barcelona and once with Inter Milan, among numerous other accolades in his illustrious career. While currently playing in Turkey with Antalyaspor, he could potentially add to his impressive tally.\n\n* **111 – Seydou Keita (Mali)**\n\nTeams: Marseille, Lens, Sevilla, Barcelona, Valencia, Roma\n\nThough recently playing in the Asian Champions League with El-Jaish (Qatar), Keita is best known for his two Champions League triumphs with Barcelona.  He also won the UEFA Super Cup with both Sevilla and Barcelona, representing a total of six teams in UEFA club competitions. The dynamic midfielder contributed significantly with crucial goals throughout his European career.\n\n* **102 – Didier Drogba (Ivory Coast)**\n\nTeams: Marseille, Chelsea, Galatasaray\n\nAt 39, Drogba continues to play for Phoenix Rising in the USA, but adding to his UEFA club competition appearances is highly unlikely.  He achieved significant success with Chelsea over nine seasons (in two spells), including a crucial role in their 2011/12 Champions League victory. He also represented Marseille and Galatasaray in European competitions.\n\n* **90 – Sammy Kuffour (Ghana)**\n\nTeams: Bayern Munich, Roma, Livorno\n\nKuffour is renowned for his 12-year tenure at Bayern Munich, where he won the Champions League in 2000/01 after a heartbreaking runner-up finish against Manchester United two years prior.  A popular figure at Bayern, he also won six Bundesliga titles before joining Roma in 2005. He later had a loan spell at Livorno, representing them in the now-defunct UEFA Cup during the 2006/07 season.\n\n* **90 – Kolo Touré (Ivory Coast)**\n\nTeams: Arsenal, Manchester City, Liverpool, Celtic\n\nTouré's 90th and final UEFA club appearance came last season in Celtic's 2-0 loss to Borussia Mönchengladbach.  He retired shortly after featuring in Liverpool's 3-1 Europa League final defeat to Sevilla, ending his career without a European club title.  He also played for Arsenal in their 2005/06 Champions League final loss to Barcelona.  His brother, Yaya Touré (Manchester City), trails him by just four appearances on the all-time African list.\n\n\n**Most Goals in UEFA Club Football**\n\n* **50 – Didier Drogba (Ivory Coast)**\n\nTeams: Marseille, Chelsea, Galatasaray\n\nDrogba is the only African player to reach the 50-goal mark in UEFA club competitions, averaging nearly a goal every other game.  Most of these goals came during his time at Chelsea, though he also scored five for Marseille and three for Galatasaray.  His equalizer against Bayern Munich in the 2012 Champions League final, paving the way for Chelsea's penalty shootout victory, remains a career highlight.\n\n\n* **48 – Samuel Eto'o (Cameroon)**\n\nTeams: Real Madrid, Mallorca, Barcelona, Internazionale, Anji Makhachkala, Chelsea, Everton\n\nEto'o will be aiming to surpass Drogba's record, though he first needs to help Antalyaspor qualify for UEFA club competitions. His first European goal came for Mallorca against Hajduk Split in 2001, and his last for Everton against FK Krasnodar in the 2014 Europa League.\n\n* **35 – George Weah (Liberia)**\n\nTeams: Monaco, Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan\n\nConsidered one of the greatest African footballers of recent decades, Weah was a prolific goalscorer for every club he represented. While he never lifted a European club trophy, he enjoyed considerable domestic success with Monaco, Paris Saint-Germain, and AC Milan, consistently scoring for each in continental competitions.  He later played for Chelsea, Manchester City, and Marseille.\n\n\n* **32 – Benni McCarthy (South Africa)**\n\nTeams: Ajax, Celta Vigo, FC Porto, Blackburn Rovers\n\nMcCarthy played a key role in FC Porto's unexpected Champions League triumph under José Mourinho in 2004. His memorable brace against Manchester United in the second round secured a 3-2 aggregate victory. He also won the UEFA Intertoto Cup with Celta Vigo and featured in European competitions for Ajax and Blackburn Rovers.\n\n* **31 – Frédéric Kanouté (Mali)**\n\nTeams: Lyon, Sevilla\n\nWhile he started his career at Lyon, Kanouté's European exploits are primarily associated with Sevilla. He helped the club secure two UEFA Cup titles (2006 and 2007), scoring in both finals.  His six goals in the 2006 competition placed him just one behind the top scorer, Matías Delgado. Born in France, Kanouté represented Mali internationally, scoring 23 goals in 35 appearances.\n\n**Other Notable Facts**\n\n* **Waiting to Break Their Duck:** Botswana, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mauritania, Seychelles, Sudan, and South Sudan are the only African nations yet to have a player feature in UEFA club competitions.\n\n* **Super Seven:** Samuel Eto'o holds the record for representing the most clubs (seven) in UEFA competitions by an African player."}
{"text": "A subroutine's source code summary is a natural language description that serves as foundational documentation in systems like JavaDocs. These summaries enable programmers to quickly grasp a subroutine's purpose without delving into the source code itself [1].  The task of writing these summaries, known as source code summarization [2], has been a prominent research area for decades.  This stems from a disconnect between programmer behavior and expectations: programmers often avoid writing summaries due to the time and effort involved [3, 4], yet rely heavily on good documentation written by others [5]. Consequently, automated code summarization is a highly valuable goal in software engineering research.\n\nRecently, intense research has focused on neural source code summarization. These approaches leverage datasets containing millions of code-summary pairs (e.g., [6, 7]) to train neural networks to predict summaries.  Almost all neural code summarization techniques employ some form of attentional encoder-decoder model, where the encoder vectorizes the source code and the decoder generates the natural language summary.  In the past five years, neural approaches have virtually replaced alternatives like sentence templates or IR-based keyword extraction [8–10].\n\nCurrent neural code summarization strategies can be broadly categorized by the type of information their encoders model. Some treat code as text, focusing on identifiers and other embedded natural language [11, 12]. Others encode the context of surrounding code within the same source file [13]. Some model code structure with RNNs by linearizing representations like the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) [12, 14, 15].  Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based encoders are also actively being explored to model structures like the AST or Code Property Graph (CPG) [16–18].  All these approaches show promise and continue to advance the state of the art.\n\nRecent work has focused on providing models with increasingly complex code representations, assuming this will yield better summary predictions [13, 15, 19, 20]. This mirrors progress in fields like machine translation and image captioning [21, 22]."}

{"text": "The increasing demand for compact, resource-constrained devices capable of diverse functions, such as sensing, identification, and machine control, has fueled the development of lightweight cryptographic designs and algorithms.  However, this resource-constrained environment presents significant security challenges.  Implementing traditional cryptographic primitives on these platforms is difficult, requiring a careful balance between compact implementation and robust security. To address this, NIST initiated the standardization process for lightweight cryptography in 2017 [1, 2].\n\nGrounded in the principles of symmetric cryptography, lightweight cryptography aims to secure Internet of Things (IoT) devices like sensors, RFID tags, medical implants, and smart cards.  Design choices including small block and key sizes, simplified round structures and key schedules, and compact implementations make lightweight ciphers ideal for providing sufficient security with minimal power, computational, and memory resources.\n\nNIST's call for proposals resulted in 57 submissions from research teams worldwide [3]. Following two rigorous evaluation rounds, as detailed in NIST IR 8369 [4], ten candidates were selected as finalists (see Table 1).  The third and final round evaluated candidates based on claimed security strength against known attacks (112 bits or more), performance in both hardware and software environments, resilience against side-channel and fault-injection attacks, and intellectual property rights [5].  In February 2023, NIST announced the ASCON family as the new lightweight cryptography standard [6].\n\nA crucial evaluation criterion for cryptographic algorithms is their resistance to known attacks, including differential and linear cryptanalysis (and their variants), as well as implementation-based attacks.  Designers and cryptanalysts globally have worked extensively to meet this requirement, resulting in substantial third-party security analysis of the finalist candidates.  Some notable analyses include:\n\n* **ASCON:** Cihangir T. [7] demonstrated key recovery using differential-linear attacks on 4 and 5 rounds of ASCON with time complexities of 2<sup>15</sup> and 2<sup>33.1</sup>, respectively.  Another study [8] utilized undisturbed s-box bits to perform impossible, truncated, and improbable differential attacks on 4 and 5 rounds. Yanbin L. et al.

{"text": "Action detection in videos, a challenging computer vision problem, aims to pinpoint the precise temporal boundaries of actions.  While many existing methods excel at detecting sparse actions in datasets like THUMOS and ActivityNet [12, 2], real-world scenarios present a denser, more continuous stream of actions.  Everyday life is filled with potential actions, making methods designed for sparsely labeled datasets less effective.\n\nSeveral approaches [9, 17, 18] have attempted to address this by modeling complex temporal relationships in densely labeled datasets such as Charades, TSU, and MultiTHUMOS [19, 7, 24]. These datasets reflect real-world complexities in three key ways: First, actions are densely labeled with fewer background instances. Second, they exhibit rich temporal structure, with co-occurring actions often following predictable patterns (e.g., taking a bottle before drinking, opening a book before reading – see Fig 1). Finally, they account for human multitasking, where multiple actions can occur concurrently (e.g., reading while drinking).\n\nExisting methods primarily focus on modeling the variation of visual cues across time, either locally [15] or globally [17], without incorporating semantic information about the relationships between actions.  However, real-world videos often contain complex actions with inherent relationships, both at the same time step and across distant time steps (see Fig. 1).  Modeling these class-temporal relationships is crucial for accurate action localization.\n\nTo address this, we introduce the Class-Temporal Relational Network (CTRN), which leverages relationships among action classes. CTRN first filters class-specific representations from input features at each time step.  Then, it utilizes this per-class representation to model inter-class relations in two ways: (1) Across different time steps, a graph-based layer learns dependencies between action classes. This shared relation map refines action features by incorporating information from related actions (e.g., opening and reading a book). A temporal aggregation layer allows the graph-based layer to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies. (2) At the same time step, a graph-based classifier leverages co-occurring action probabilities to improve detection performance."}

{"text": "The Earth, ancient and weary, lay cloaked in brown. Her seas and lands, once teeming with life, now bore only the scars of a bygone era. All but the hardiest life forms had perished long ago, victims of their own creators.  Those killers had fled to the stars a millennium past, believing they would never return.\n\nBut return they did, transformed by time and wisdom.  Though bearing little resemblance to the life that had once flourished on Earth, they remembered their ancestors, their lost world, and mourned.\n\nEarth had become a hallowed ground, orbited by a solitary space station – a pilgrimage site for all humanity. Each yearned to visit their birthplace, to pay homage to their origins, humbled by the thought of their entire race once confined to a single globe.  To those who recalled ancient history, it was a new Mecca.\n\nHere, a small council had convened, hoping to mend the past.\n\nAt the space station's heart lay the time machine, a pyramidal structure currently dormant.  Most travelers arrived through portals opened directly to it, bridging vast gulfs in spacetime. The council formed a vast circle around this silent monolith.\n\n\"We are gathered,\" a voice resonated through the chamber.\n\n\"We are gathered,\" echoed a chorus of voices, a symphony of accents and tones.\n\n\"This is futile,\" a lone voice dissented.  \"Time's flow cannot be altered.  To attempt it is to fail.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" a few murmured.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" countered another voice from the throng. \"Yet, we must try. For to not try is a greater failure still.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" the vast majority affirmed.\n\n\"But who will go?\" the initial, booming voice inquired.\n\nSilence descended as gazes shifted. Then, two figures emerged from the crowd, one trailing the other.\n\nThe first, a woman, possessed a lithe form, long legs, and an elegantly elongated head. Her blue eyes glowed, and her smooth, white skin, unmarred by clothing, shimmered like a rare pearl.\n\nThe second, a man, was short and slender, with wiry muscles and a disproportionately large head. His massive, slanted, dark eyes contrasted sharply with his dull gray skin as he surveyed the assembled council.\n\n\"We will go,\" he declared, his voice high and melodious.\n\n\"They shall go,\" the thousand voices confirmed.\n\n\"But to when?\" the dissenting voice persisted. \"The histories are lost. How can we choose a destination?\"\n\n\"Not all is lost,\" a new voice responded.  Its owner, visible near the circle's inner edge, was short and powerfully built, with four thick arms crossed over his chest. \"Relics on Earth reveal two crucial points: civilization's dawn and its demise.  We will send one volunteer to each.\"\n\n\"We will,\" the council affirmed as one.\n\nThe two volunteers exchanged a look.  The pearl-skinned woman knelt, kissing the gray man. \"I will await you,\" she whispered, then rose and addressed the council. \"I shall journey to the beginning. I will seek ways to guide our ancestors toward technologies that harmonize with nature.\"\n\n\"She shall,\" the council responded as the pyramid hummed to life, its apex opening to reveal a swirling portal. With a final glance at the gray man, she stepped into the unknown.\n\nAnd just like that, she was gone.  The gray man stared at the pyramid, his silence heavy with grief. The council, respecting his sorrow, waited patiently.\n\nFinally, breaking the spell, he spoke.  \"I will journey to the end. I will search for ways to alter Earth's final days, to preserve its health, and to guide our ancestors toward wisdom.\"  *And to find her,* he added silently to himself.\n\n\"He shall,\" the council murmured.\n\nThe pyramid opened once more.  Through the portal, he saw blue skies, clouds, and humans – all remarkably similar. They appeared so strange, so different, so primitive."}
{"text": "Le domaine financier regorge d'acronymes, dominés par le célèbre PIB.  Pourtant, face à la résistance croissante à l'impôt et à la crise du consentement qui en découle, un nouvel indicateur s’impose.  Il ne s’agit plus seulement du PIB, mais d’un indice mesurant le passage d’un consentement contraint à une adhésion sincère à l’impôt, un « haut les cœurs » fiscal.\n\nDans un climat où la fiscalité effraie, où le contribuable, atteint par les syndromes de Météo et de Pénélope, ressent l'impôt comme une injustice, la création de cet indicateur devient urgente. Le syndrome de Météo décrit ce décalage entre la réalité fiscale et un ressenti négatif amplifié,  tandis que le syndrome de Pénélope illustre l’instabilité du système fiscal, un éternel recommencement qui rend le message illisible.\n\nContribuable heureux, un oxymore ?  Pas forcément.  Mais dans un État où les 70 codes de droit s’empilent, formant une hypothétique stèle de 3200 mètres de haut, sur laquelle le Code Général des Impôts clignote  au rythme effréné des modifications législatives, la question se pose.  D’autant plus que le Conseil d'État dénonçait déjà en 1991 cette logorrhée législative.\n\nAlors, sur quels critères fonder ce nouvel indice ? Quels remèdes apporter pour un mieux-être fiscal ?  Benjamin Constant assignait à l’État la responsabilité de la justice, laissant aux citoyens la poursuite du bonheur.  Un État juste est un État où l’action publique est efficace, où les contreparties de l’impôt sont visibles et perçues comme justes.  Le consentement à l’impôt en découle naturellement.\n\nMais avec un taux de prélèvements obligatoires de 46% du PIB, parmi les plus élevés de l’OCDE, est-ce encore possible ?  Tocqueville nous rappelle que dans une société inégalitaire, les plus fortes inégalités passent inaperçues, mais dès lors qu’une certaine égalité est atteinte, le moindre écart blesse.  L'aspiration à l'égalité devient insatiable,  oubliant parfois que la pire des inégalités est de traiter également des situations différentes.  Égalitarisme, égalité, équité, solidarité, autant de notions qui alimentent le débat fiscal français sans pour autant convaincre. Ni les « donneurs universels » (peu nombreux mais fortement taxés) de la justesse de leur contribution, ni les « receveurs » (nombreux) de la suffisance des  prélèvements.\n\nComment parler de l’impôt sur le revenu sans évoquer les prélèvements et cotisations sociales ?  Leur effet redistributif, particulièrement important en France, réduit les inégalités. Le rapport de Dominique Lefebvre (avril 2014) montre que le système socio-fiscal français réduit de 40% les écarts de niveau de vie entre les 10% les plus modestes et les 10% les plus aisés."}

{"text": "Ten thousand migrants in Italy are living in deplorable conditions without shelter, food, or clean water, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) warned in a damning indictment of the country's border practices. Inadequate reception policies are forcing refugees into slums, squats, and abandoned buildings with limited access to basic services.  MSF found that increasing marginalization of asylum seekers and a growing prevalence of forced evictions have led to small, hidden migrant communities, exposing them to inhumane living conditions.\n\nThese findings, released in the second edition of MSF's \"Out of Sight\" report, reveal the harsh reality facing a significant portion of Italy's migrant population.  The report's release coincides with a surge in anti-immigration rhetoric ahead of the March 4 parliamentary elections, and comes as Italians express growing unease over the number of refugees arriving by sea over the past four years.\n\nOn Saturday in Macerata, a far-right extremist was arrested for allegedly shooting six Africans in a racially motivated attack.  Days later, former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, whose Forza Italia party is part of a coalition with the Northern League and Brothers of Italy, pledged to deport 600,000 migrants if the coalition wins the election.  Claiming immigration is a \"social bomb\" linked to crime, Berlusconi said, \"These 600,000 people—we will pick them up using police, law enforcement, and the military… everyone can help identify them by pointing them out, and they will be picked up.\"  Northern League leader Matteo Salvini echoed this sentiment, promising to round up and deport \"irregular\" migrants \"in 15 minutes\" if his coalition takes power.\n\nBerlusconi's opponents, however, quickly criticized him for allowing the dire humanitarian conditions faced by refugees to develop during his three terms as prime minister. Charities accused him of exploiting the situation for political gain.  Alberto Barbieri, director of Medici per i Diritti Umani (MEDU), an Italian medical human rights organization, called Berlusconi's comments \"false, irresponsible, and propagandistic,\" telling *The Independent*, \"In the climate of the electoral campaign, he is trying to mobilize the worst instincts and irrational fears of citizens.\"\n\nBarbieri added, \"Migrants arriving in Italy are fleeing serious violence in their countries of origin and along the migratory route.  Since there are no humanitarian corridors, they are forced to rely on human smugglers and traffickers to reach Europe.\" He noted that 90 percent of the migrants MEDU has assisted in the last four years were victims of torture and degrading treatment.  \"They are vulnerable people, not people ‘ready’ to commit crimes,\" he emphasized.  \"We acknowledge the complexities of the current migration phenomenon and the considerable difficulties in its management, but Mr. Berlusconi’s statements do nothing to find solutions compatible with civil coexistence and respect for human rights.  Instead, they fuel confusion, xenophobia, and racism, purely for electoral purposes.\"\n\nMSF is calling for urgent action from the Italian government to guarantee refugees access to basic necessities and medical care throughout their stay in Italy. They urge authorities to improve the emergency reception system and promote better social inclusion for migrants.  \"Instead of long-term policies that address the basic needs of this relatively manageable number of people living in inhumane conditions, we are witnessing increasing criminalization of migrants and refugees, and of those who help them,\" said Tommaso Fabbri, head of MSF’s projects in Italy.  \"European and Italian policies should be helping these men, women, and children, not harming them.

El comunicado puntualizaba que la huelga  abarcaría a todos los choferes de corta distancia a nivel nacional.

Según el informe 'Trafficking in Persons' del Departamento de Estado de Estados Unidos, en España, durante 2019, se identificaron 467 víctimas de trata (cuatro menores),  250 por explotación sexual, 173 laboral, 23 en actividades ilícitas y 20 en mendicidad.  Esto supone un aumento respecto a las 225 identificadas en 2018. Además, las organizaciones sociales reportaron haber atendido a 638 víctimas y 4.842 potenciales. Sin embargo, Cruz Roja Española advierte que estos casos representan solo el 5% de los existentes, según datos de Naciones Unidas, evidenciando la \"invisibilidad\" del fenómeno.\n\nLa responsable de la Unidad de Trata de Cruz Roja, Rosa Flores, en una entrevista con Europa Press con motivo del Día Mundial contra la Trata (30 de julio), ha alertado sobre las dificultades para acceder al Ingreso Mínimo Vital.  Según el Real Decreto que lo regula, las víctimas de trata, aunque en situación irregular,  deberían poder acceder a esta prestación, junto con solicitantes de protección internacional y víctimas de violencia de género. Sin embargo, Flores advierte que \"resulta imposible tramitarlo\" sin DNI, permiso de residencia o trabajo, empadronamiento y cuenta bancaria.  \"No puedes pasar de la primera pantalla si no tienes DNI\", afirma.

{"text": "Semantic communication, a core technology anticipated for 6G wireless networks, offers high communication efficiency by transmitting compact semantic features instead of raw data bit sequences [1].  While traditional communication systems offer some inherent privacy due to redundant bits [2]-[4], semantic communication’s conciseness poses a significant security risk. This paper addresses this vulnerability by introducing the Model Inversion Eavesdropping Attack (MIEA) and proposing a defense mechanism.\n\nExisting semantic communication research primarily employs deep learning (DL) to extract and reconstruct these features [5].  However, this reliance on DL introduces vulnerabilities.  Transmitted semantic features, if intercepted, could allow malicious actors to reconstruct the original message using DL-based attacks [9].  Furthermore, the compact nature of semantic features may leak more private information than traditional bit sequences.  For instance, an attacker could add perturbations to the transmitted data, causing errors in downstream tasks like image classification or speech recognition [7].  Similarly, semantic data poisoning attacks can manipulate the received message entirely, as demonstrated by Du et al. [8], where a desired image is replaced with an unrelated one by minimizing the difference between their semantic features.\n\n\nSecurity in semantic communication is crucial for two primary reasons. First, the compact and semantically rich nature of transmitted symbols potentially reveals more private information than traditional methods. Second, the deep learning models integral to semantic communication are susceptible to various attacks. Several studies have explored these security concerns [6]-[8]. While Tung et al. [6] proposed encrypting the transmitted signal, this method introduces substantial computational overhead.\n\n\nIn MIEA, an attacker attempts to reconstruct the original message by inverting the transmitter's DL model using intercepted symbols. This attack is explored under both white-box (attacker knows the DL model) and black-box (attacker does not know the DL model) settings.  To mitigate this threat, we propose a defense method based on random permutation and substitution.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section II provides a foundational overview of semantic communication. Section III details the proposed MIEA under both white-box and black-box settings and introduces our defense method.  Section IV presents the performance evaluation of both the attack and the defense mechanism under various channel conditions, demonstrating the effectiveness of MIEA and the robustness of our proposed defense. Finally, Section V concludes the paper."}

{"text": "The \"Face on Mars\" is a natural landform. This was confirmed in 1976 when Viking 1 photographed the Martian surface, revealing what appeared to be a face. On April 5, 1998, the Global Surveyor was sent to orbit and photograph the specific location. Its image, ten times sharper than Viking's, revealed the formation to be nothing more than a natural landform, a finding quickly published online.\n\nLocated at 41 degrees north Martian latitude, the feature was imaged in April 1998 during a cloudy period on Mars, making observation challenging.  Mr. Garvin noted the difficulty in targeting the \"Face,\" explaining that the Surveyor, a mapping spacecraft, typically looks straight down and scans the planet in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips, much like a fax machine.\n\nOn a clear Martian day, April 8, 2001, the Global Surveyor passed close enough for another, even higher-resolution image.  Each pixel in the 2001 image represented 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best Viking photograph. This image definitively showed the \"Face on Mars\" to be the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, landforms common in the American West."}

Originally released for the Nintendo 3DS in Japan in 2013, *Yo-kai Watch* saw a worldwide release through Nintendo in 2015.  The sequel, *Yo-kai Watch 2*, enjoyed a surge in popularity, but sadly, that marked the franchise's peak; it has since faded from the spotlight. I thoroughly enjoyed the 3DS *Yo-kai Watch* game, but the second entry was truly exceptional.  Even the *Yo-kai Watch* anime received a global release with dubs. Despite the 2016 announcement, *Yo-kai Watch* never made it to mobile platforms at the time, though it did receive a Nintendo Switch port, which I imported from the Japanese eShop.

I admit, a thrill always coursed through me when they realized their party lacked a priest.

Years of battle training couldn't conquer their fear of the undead. One swung for my neck, but the blow went wide.

I'd wasted enough time. My eyes burned bright green, my robes smoldered, and I seized the final attacker. His screams made my spine shudder as his flesh burned to the bone, and he collapsed, dead.\n\nI extended my palm toward the first attacker, the so-called Captain.

A rapid count by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) gave Morales, in power since 2006, a narrow 10-point lead over his rival Carlos Mesa, just enough to avoid a second-round runoff. This result, however, followed an abrupt halt to a preliminary count on Sunday night, which at the time showed the two candidates heading for a run-off.\n\nThe Organization of American States (OAS), an official election observer, expressed deep concern over the \"hard-to-explain\" shift in the vote count, stating that it \"drastically modified the fate of the election and generates a loss of confidence in the electoral process.\" The OAS said it would recommend a second-round vote.\n\nMesa rejected the official results, echoing the OAS’s concerns.  \"This is a tragic day for Bolivian democracy,\" Carlos Alarcon, a representative of Mesa's Citizen Community party, said at a protest site. \"Morales has once again robbed the vote, the right to decide by our votes who will be president of Bolivia.\"\n\nThe disputed results ignited protests across the country.  On Tuesday, following a night of rioting and clashes between voters and police, groups of protesters remained on the streets.  Several vote counting stations and ballot boxes were set ablaze.  In one dramatic incident in Potosi, two people jumped from a burning building to escape the flames.  In La Paz, residents stocked up on essential supplies like rice, cooking oil, and potatoes, fearing prolonged unrest.  Videos circulating on social media and television showed protesters toppling a statue of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Riberalta and violent clashes between police and masked youths. Long lines formed at gas stations and supermarkets despite assurances from local food and energy associations that there were no shortages.\n\nA pro-Morales political group, Conalcam, condemned the unrest, accusing the right-wing opposition of orchestrating the violence and calling on Morales' supporters to defend his \"victory\" with peaceful counter-protests.  Morales himself has maintained a low profile since claiming victory on Sunday night, only taking to Twitter early Tuesday to remind Bolivians of the high poverty rates under a previous right-wing government.  Late on Monday, Interior Minister Carlos Romero warned Mesa and his supporters against inciting violence, stating that they would be held responsible for any escalation.\n\nA binding vote count is still underway and could take several days to complete.

{"text": "Video conferencing systems have become indispensable for global business operations and accessible education, revolutionizing how people connect and collaborate across geographical boundaries [3, 17].  A key factor influencing the quality of experience (QoE) is bandwidth estimation—the process of estimating the bottleneck link's capacity between sender and receiver [1]. In real-time communication (RTC) systems, this estimate dictates the audio/video encoder's target bit rate, controlling the client's send rate [13, 24].\n\nOverestimating bandwidth leads to network congestion, characterized by increased delays, jitter, and packet loss [29].  Users experience detrimental effects such as frequent resolution switches, video freezes, garbled speech, and audio/video desynchronization. Conversely, underestimating bandwidth results in lower-quality audio/video streams, underutilizing the network and degrading QoE.  Therefore, accurate bandwidth estimation is crucial for optimal user QoE in RTC systems.  However, achieving accuracy is challenging due to several factors: dynamic network paths with fluctuating traffic loads; diverse wired and wireless network technologies with distinct characteristics; competing transmission protocols vying for bandwidth; and the limited availability of only local packet statistics for client-side estimation.\n\nThe previous ACM MMSys 2021 bandwidth estimation challenge (https://2021.acmmmsys.org/rtc_challenge.php) provided participants with an NS-3 based simulation environment (\"gym\") and focused on online reinforcement learning (RL) for bandwidth estimation.  However, policies trained in simulation with network-based rewards may not be optimal in real-world deployments due to challenges like the sim-to-real gap [14] and the misalignment between network-measured rewards and actual user-perceived QoE [15]. To address this, the ACM MMSys 2024 Grand Challenge aims to advance bandwidth estimation for RTC by training models through offline RL. This will utilize a real-world dataset of network dynamics and objective metrics highly correlated with user-perceived audio/video quality in Microsoft Teams."}

{"text": "The clinical application of millions of sequenced human genomes and exomes remains limited by the challenge of distinguishing disease-causing missense variants from benign variations. Variants of uncertain significance (VUS) pose a significant obstacle due to their abundance and rarity, making their interpretation a time-consuming process that hinders diagnostic sequencing.  Furthermore, the sheer volume of VUSes limits the effectiveness of applications reliant on genotype-phenotype associations, such as disease association studies and patient stratification in drug development.\n\nAt the heart of missense variant prediction lies the fundamental challenge of understanding the relationship between protein sequence, structure, and function.  A deep understanding of this interplay is crucial for determining the impact of missense variants. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly contextual language models trained on vast protein sequence datasets, have begun to bridge this sequence-function gap. These models offer insights into protein formation, structure, and function based solely on sequence.  However, their predictive power for specific tasks still lags behind methods incorporating evolutionary information derived from multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). This evolutionary information, such as amino acid conservation patterns, reflects functional and structural constraints, providing valuable data for missense variant effect prediction.\n\nThe quality of MSA data is crucial for detecting and interpreting these evolutionary signals.  Deep, high-quality MSAs integrated with protein structure data are essential in fields requiring detailed understanding of individual amino acid roles, including protein optimization and drug development.  However, the lack of such high-quality, large-scale protein annotation data has hampered its application in missense effect prediction.\n\nTo address this, we present Helix, a missense variant effect predictor built on a comprehensive resource of integrated protein data.  Helix combines over 30,000 protein family structure-based MSAs, over 50,000 protein structures, and approximately 60,000 human targeted sequence-based MSAs to provide deep annotations for all human proteins at the individual amino acid level.  Helix integrates this data with contextual language models, capturing both explicit evolutionary information and implicit knowledge of protein properties.\n\nHelix utilizes features describing proteins and their constraints at multiple levels.  These include MSA-derived metrics reflecting selective pressures on proteins, functional residue networks, and individual positions."}

{"text": "What have the national anthem, breastfeeding, sarcasm and environmental disasters got in common? Over the last year, there have been calls for each of these topics to be taught in schools – a practice known as ‘curriculum dumping’. Every time a societal issue arises, the expectation is for schools to address it.  If only pupils learned about knife crime, acid attacks, revenge porn, or gambling, the logic goes, these problems would disappear.\n\nThis raises some common sense questions. With an already packed curriculum, do schools have the time and expertise?  A new report by the campaign group Parents and Teachers for Excellence highlights this issue. After scouring social media, newspapers, and other sources, the group unearthed 213 examples of suggested new ‘subjects’ for 2018 alone.  It points out that schools would need hundreds of additional hours to teach them all.  The top three themes proposed were health, finance, and technology.  Other suggestions included the Commonwealth, workers’ rights, litter picking, the RAF, marriage, how to avoid dog bites, oceans, feminism, and even using trampolining to teach literacy skills or Love Island to critique celebrity culture.  Some of the more outlandish ideas included teaching sado-masochism and swearing.\n\nThe report also raises concerns over schools becoming ‘catnip’ for lobby groups and policy-makers, asking, “What should schools stop doing to make time for your proposal?” Parents and Teachers for Excellence concludes: “We believe that teachers and schools are the ones best placed to decide what their students need to know.”\n\nYet, sometimes policy-makers do offer valuable suggestions.  Education Secretary Damian Hinds recently revealed a new initiative: a ‘bucket list’ or ‘passport’ of activities for primary pupils, encouraging learning outside the classroom.  This recognizes that learning doesn’t have to be confined to school and that parents can be the natural educators.  The passport includes 20 activities for each year group.  Tasks for reception pupils include visiting a farm, painting a self-portrait, making a paper boat, re-telling a story to an audience, and posting a letter."}

{"text": "An Australian couple, Alan John Miller and Mary Suzanne Luck, have garnered attention for their extraordinary claim: they believe they are the reincarnations of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene.  This assertion, made public in 2011, attracted followers and sparked controversy.\n\nMiller, now 56, explains on his website: \"Just a little over 2,000 years ago, we arrived on the Earth for the first time. Because of my personal desire and passion for God, as I grew, I recognized not only that I was the Messiah that was foretold by ancient prophets, but also that I was in a process designed by God that all humans could follow, if they so desired.\"  He claims to have memories from his first life, including \"memories of somebody putting nails through my feet and through my wrists. I remember being speared, being threatened, and being beaten on a number of occasions almost to the point of death.\"  However, it wasn't until his 30s, after a divorce, that he fully realized his supposed identity.  He also has two children from his previous marriage.\n\nLuck, 41, a former occupational therapist, met Miller in 2007 during a presentation he gave to her and her parents.  Since then, they have actively spread what they call \"Divine Truth,\" establishing a following in Wilkesdale, Queensland, where they relocated. By 2011, they had amassed 30 to 40 disciples.  Their followers even pooled $400,000 in 2009 to purchase land for weekly meetings and a planned international visitors center, leading to a local property boom as believers moved closer to the couple.\n\nBoth Miller and Luck admit to losing family and friends after revealing their beliefs. Luck recounts, \"I had one friend who was interested at first… but then her in-laws put a load of pressure on her to stay away… It was like I'd died, and they just had to move on.\" Miller adds, \"I feel like it's a pretty hard thing to accept. It scares people… I'm saying the truth. I know my intentions are right.\"\n\nDespite the skepticism, Miller maintains his conviction.  He explains his reasoning: \"Well, I knew there were four options. I thought: Either I think I'm Jesus and I am, or I think I'm Jesus and I'm not, which would make me crazy. Or I think I'm Alan John Miller and I am which would make me sane. Or finally, I think I'm Alan John Miller but I'm not and that would make me crazy.\"  He and Luck state that their ultimate goal is to inspire love, with Miller writing on his website that he hopes their message of \"Divine Truth\" will spread to others.\n\nOrganizations like Australia's Cult Awareness and Information Centre and the Catholic Church have expressed concern, urging caution and highlighting the potential for undue influence in such movements.  Spokeswoman Helen Pomery noted, \"The moment someone becomes God or God's voice on Earth it gives them another level of authority to enforce submission to them.\"\n\nEven if proven wrong in the afterlife, Miller remains unfazed. \"Fine,\" he says. \"I'd be curious to know where we got it wrong. But I'd feel like at least we lived in accordance with what we thought was true.\"\n\n*Editor's Note: This article was originally posted on May 17, 2011 and was updated with the latest information.*  *Stephanie Castillo is a writer whose work has been featured in Prevention, Women's Health, and more.*"}

{"text": "The rapid advancement of technology, while often beneficial, raises concerns about privacy, especially in sensitive environments like classrooms.  The article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" which promotes emotion-recognition software like the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), fails to convincingly argue for its classroom implementation. In fact, it inadvertently highlights the significant privacy invasion such technology represents.  The article suggests classrooms could use FACS to detect student confusion or boredom and adjust lessons accordingly, mimicking a human instructor.  This premise, however, is flawed.\n\nThe analogy between FACS and a human instructor is weak. While the article notes that humans can often gauge emotions through facial expressions, this overlooks the richness of human interaction.  A teacher's presence offers more than just facial cues; their body language, tone of voice, and ability to respond to individual questions in real-time are crucial for effective teaching.  Moreover, studies show that many students learn better with direct teacher interaction than online, rendering the software's proposed benefits less impactful.  Replacing a teacher's nuanced understanding with software that merely tracks basic emotions would likely be detrimental to the learning process.\n\nFurther illustrating the disconnect between FACS and classroom needs, the article presents a jarring example: if a student smiles at an online ad, similar ads will follow.  This example, intended to showcase the technology's capabilities, instead exposes its invasive nature within the educational context.  It raises the alarming prospect of students being constantly monitored and their responses tracked, even for non-educational purposes.  Imagine this scenario playing out in classrooms, where students' emotional responses to their work are constantly scrutinized and potentially used for purposes beyond learning.  This is a clear breach of privacy.\n\nThe article's argument weakens further when it suggests FACS can personalize learning by adjusting to student emotions.  This ignores the existing reality in many schools, like Floyd Central High School, where students already use iPads for learning.  Adding emotion-recognition software wouldn't significantly enhance the personalized learning experience, but it would dramatically increase the potential for privacy violations.\n\nUltimately, the integration of FACS into classrooms offers little educational value while posing significant privacy risks.  It's a costly and time-consuming endeavor that would be better directed towards proven methods of enhancing student learning.  Instead of relying on emotion-reading software, schools should focus on providing adequate teacher support and resources that foster a positive and privacy-respecting learning environment."}

{"text": "High-quality data fuels modern machine learning, and nearly all models improve with better data [8, 50, 80].  Consequently, such data is crucial for developing future techniques. Acquiring large datasets is particularly challenging due to human involvement.  Human error and subjective interpretation of annotation tasks can introduce noise and ambiguity into labels [9, 16, 18, 28, 29, 52, 54, 61]. This results in heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainty—inherent, class- or even sample-dependent noise that negatively impacts data quality [14].\n\nFigure 1 illustrates this uncertainty's impact on the \"cat\" class in the CIFAR-10 dataset [32]. While all images share the same ground truth label, human annotation agreement rates vary widely, from 4% to 100% [54]. This indicates potential noise in individual annotations, as they may diverge from the majority opinion. Moreover, majority voting across multiple annotations cannot capture the ambiguity between images. In some extreme cases (highlighted with red borders), the majority vote even contradicts the expected ground truth label. This raises the question: should all images be treated equally when human annotations exhibit such varying certainty?  Adopting a data-centric perspective [25, 45, 47, 62], we investigate the data itself, rather than solely the model, to address this question.  Specifically, we propose a data-centric image classification (DCIC) benchmark that indirectly measures a method's ability to identify and correct noisy and ambiguous labels.  DCIC comprises ten real-world datasets from diverse domains (Figure 2) with multiple human annotations per image. This benchmark emphasizes a data-centric view by separating data quality improvement and classification performance into distinct tasks.\n\nThe benchmark's core structure, divided into Labeling and Evaluation phases (Figure 3a), resembles established teacher-student approaches [36, 70].  The benchmarked method acts as a \"teacher,\" refining labels during the Labeling phase. These refined labels are then evaluated in the Evaluation phase by assessing their efficacy as training data for a \"student\" model.  Crucially, no knowledge transfer is permitted from the Evaluation phase back to the Labeling phase.\n\nDuring the Labeling phase, we use samples from the distribution of the aforementioned annotations to generate realistic initial label estimates. The benchmarked method's task is to improve these estimates to enhance the performance of a separate classification model in the subsequent Evaluation phase.  In this phase, the refined labels are used to train a fixed model, and its performance is measured on a testing subset of the original data.  Unlike conventional model-centric deep learning approaches (Figure 3b), our approach allows us to vary the initialization for the same method, better isolating its performance from the data improvement.  The fixed model ensures that performance gains are attributable to improved input data rather than the learning capacity of the model itself.\n\n*Figure 1: Are all images showing a cat?*  Based on their CIFAR-10 ground truth labels [32], they should be. However, the agreement rates with the \"cat\" class from [54], displayed in the lower right corner, range from 4% to 100%.  Based on majority voting, the final images (red border) would be labeled as dog, frog, dog, and deer, respectively. This paper addresses whether all images should be treated equally as \"cat\" or if multiple annotations and resulting soft labels should be used to capture this inherent noise and ambiguity.\n\n*Figure 2: Three example images for all datasets.* Dataset statistics are detailed in Table 1.\n\nOur benchmark not only facilitates the evaluation of existing methods but also supports research into algorithms for realistic datasets. It can bridge the gap between semi-supervised learning and noise estimation based on realistic ambiguous noise patterns. We provide multiple baseline algorithms and support integration of additional algorithms through common data loaders for TensorFlow [1] and PyTorch [53].  We analyzed thousands of combinations of baseline methods, initializations, and datasets. Our results confirm that improved data quality leads to performance gains. Furthermore, we investigated factors influencing data quality and identified trends that enhance learning of the underlying distribution.\n\n*Figure 3: Comparison of our data-centric approach with the common model-centric approach.* Circles and arrows represent available label information alongside corresponding images."}

I couldn’t fathom how she’d managed for weeks like this.  She'd abandoned her high heels long ago, and we hadn't had time to find her replacements. Her feet were calloused and bleeding. Propped against the wall, she reached down, massaging the pain from her soles. Her eyes, searching mine, pleaded for reassurance.\n\nWe stood frozen, the silence stretching long enough for me to consider, and discard, a thousand hollow comforts. I couldn't think of a damn thing worth saying.\n\nThe echo of their pursuit reverberated up the stairwell.  They were close, maybe four flights down if we were lucky.\n\nI slung her arm over my shoulders and dashed into the hallway. Two doors down, an open apartment offered refuge. We slipped inside.\n\nThey were gaining. I turned the lock, finding a sliver of comfort in this anarchic world.  Nowhere was safe, but that inch of metal between us and them offered a fragile illusion of security.\n\nI helped her to a couch in the living room. The television droned the same emergency broadcast that had become the soundtrack to our nightmare: *“This is the emergency broadcast system. Martial law is now in effect due to an unprecedented outbreak of the D4 Lunar Virus. Symptoms may include fever, chest pain, nausea, dilated pupils, discolored skin, and uncontrollable muscle spasms.

If you yourself need medical assistance, please seek aid at your nearest Emergency Medical Station. Stay in your homes. Food and water will be provided to you shortly.”*\n\n“What a load of bullshit,” she said, wiping away tears. “Those weren’t medical stations, they were execution lines.”\n\nShe was right. She had no proof, but she was right. I tried to deny it, to deny the memory of my brother’s visit to one of those stations. He’d needed antibiotics, desperately.\n\nHe’d been stabbed in a shopping mall the day after the outbreak. The city air, thick with pollutants from the new oil refineries, had infected the wound within minutes. He’d stitched himself up, but the infection discolored his skin, unsettling people."}

{"text": "The increasing demand for wireless communication necessitates operation in higher frequency bands like millimeter wave (mmWave), a spectrum largely pre-allocated to radar systems [1].  This overlap, particularly with automotive and high-resolution imaging radars operating in the 76-81 GHz and 200 GHz bands [2], makes harmonious coexistence crucial for achieving the ultra-high throughput goals of future wireless networks [1, 3-5].  Two primary coexistence approaches exist: interference management [1, 6], which focuses on suppressing mutual interference between radar and communication systems, and Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) [3, 4], which employs a single, cleverly designed waveform for both functions. ISAC offers superior potential due to its inherent synergy and its applicability to emerging applications [3, 4, 7], potentially even enhancing the performance of both radar and communication functionalities [8].\n\nThis potential for mutual benefit arises from the similar channel characteristics shared by radar and communication.  Consider a typical downlink scenario with co-located radar and communication antennas at a base station (BS).  Despite radar relying on round-trip echoes and communication on one-way transmissions, the BS-UE (User Equipment) channel is fundamentally the same.  Radar, with its knowledge of transmitted signals, leverages matched-filtering for parameter estimation, achieving significantly higher gains than communication's channel estimation methods [4]. This suggests exploiting radar-derived Channel State Information (CSI) to enhance communication design.  Further synergy arises from the alignment between radar's parameter estimation based on delay, Doppler, and angular features and the principles of Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation [9-11].  OTFS, unlike OFDM, employs delay-Doppler (DD) domain symbol multiplexing, enabling direct interaction between information symbols and the DD channel, which can be inferred from radar estimates [4]. This synergistic relationship motivates the exploration of OTFS-based ISAC transmission.\n\nExisting research on OTFS-based ISAC has explored various avenues.  Initial studies demonstrated the feasibility of achieving satisfactory communication performance while maintaining radar estimation accuracy [12] and extended this to MIMO systems using hybrid beamforming [13], including an efficient ML algorithm for target detection and parameter estimation.  Further work has focused on developing OTFS-based matched-filter algorithms for improved range and velocity estimation [14] and proposing ISAC-assisted OTFS systems for both uplink and downlink communication, incorporating novel DD domain channel estimation and message-passing detection algorithms [4].  While promising, these approaches often rely on sophisticated, CSIT-dependent beamforming schemes [4, 13].  However, in scenarios like co-located antennas, radar sensing doesn't directly provide communication channel fading coefficients.  Radar echo strength depends on antenna effective area and radar cross-section (RCS) [16], while communication channel fading depends on path loss and scattering [15], creating a mismatch in reflection strengths.  Consequently, beams steered towards the strongest radar echo path may not be optimal for communication.\n\nTo address this mismatch, we propose a novel ISAC framework based on spatially-spread OTFS (SS-OTFS) modulation, introducing the concept of SS-OTFS for exploiting delay-Doppler-angular (DDA) channel characteristics.  SS-OTFS incorporates spatial spreading and de-spreading modules at the transmitter and receiver, respectively, discretizing the angular domain and simplifying the input-output relationships for radar and communication.  This discretization associates each antenna (pair) with a specific angle, enabling separation of multi-path effects and facilitating system design based solely on radar-estimated delays, Dopplers, AoAs, and reflection coefficients, without prior knowledge of communication channel fading coefficients.  Our key contributions are: (1) Derivation of communication and radar models for SS-OTFS-enabled ISAC, demonstrating the near-elimination of spatial multiplexing interference and resulting in simplified effective channel matrices; (2) Development of simple beam tracking and AoA estimation algorithms exploiting the structure of the radar sensing matrix, enabling beam width control through power allocation and straightforward AoA estimation; (3) Analysis of precoding matrices and power allocation impacts on PEP for the communication model, leading to a precoding design using virtual delay and Doppler indices and demonstrating the optimality of equal power allocation; and (4) Discussion and simulation verification of radar and communication performance trade-offs with different power allocations, suggesting a bias towards radar in practical scenarios and validating the effectiveness of the proposed SS-OTFS ISAC framework."}
{"text": "Large language models (LLMs), the core engines of applications like Chat-GPT, are becoming increasingly pervasive.  Understanding their capabilities and limitations when processing diverse forms of language is crucial. This work focuses on slang, a ubiquitous form of informal language common in everyday conversations (Mattiello, 2005; Eble, 2012).  As Figure 1 illustrates, slang poses unique challenges for natural language processing (NLP).  For example, while \"excellent\" and \"blazing\" can describe a jacket similarly, an LLM's unfamiliarity with slang might lead to performance discrepancies. Previous work suggests pre-trained LLMs assign lower probabilities to slang than their literal equivalents (Sun et al., 2021, 2022), indicating models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) lack slang knowledge.\n\nSlang knowledge in LLMs has implications beyond informal language processing.  Slang usage reflects social identity (Labov, 1972, 2006; Eble, 2012). \"Blazing,\" for instance, means \"excellent\" in the US but \"anger\" in the UK (Green, 2010). This variability can introduce representational harm (Blodgett et al., 2020) as NLP system performance can differ significantly across demographics like age, gender, region, and ethnicity (Hovy and Søgaard, 2015; Hovy and Spruit, 2016; Blodgett and O'Connor, 2017; Tatman, 2017; Buolamwini and Gebru, 2018; Koenecke et al., 2020). Consequently, a slang-competent LLM could reveal a user's identity, potentially improving NLP performance (Volkova et al., 2013; Hovy, 2015) but also increasing the risk of personal information exposure.\n\nDespite these implications, rigorous slang-based evaluation of LLMs is lacking, primarily due to the scarcity of publicly accessible, high-quality datasets.  Existing dictionaries (e.g., Green, 2010) often lack metadata like literal paraphrases.  Paired examples like those in Figure 1 (e.g., \"blazing\" and \"excellent\") are crucial for controlled LLM probing.  To address this, we introduce a publicly available dataset of slang usages from the OpenSubtitles corpus (Lison and Tiedemann, 2016). Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate LLM slang knowledge, focusing on widely adopted GPT models (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023).  Our results demonstrate that while LLMs possess considerable slang knowledge, task-specific fine-tuning is essential for optimal performance.\n\nWe focus on two core tasks, illustrated in Figure 1: slang detection in natural sentences and identifying the regional-historical origins of slang via text classification. We also examine LLMs' semantic understanding of slang compared to conventional language.  Throughout our evaluation, we highlight performance discrepancies across demographics and discuss implications for fairness and privacy.\n\nOur contributions are: 1) A publicly available dataset of annotated English slang usages from movie subtitles, providing a novel benchmark for evaluation and fine-tuning; 2) A rigorous evaluation of LLM slang knowledge, including slang detection; 3) A discussion of the implications of this knowledge for fairness and privacy in NLP.\n\n\nFootnotes:\n\n1.

{"text": "This paper studies Probabilistic Almost-Sure Termination (PAST) for imperative programs augmented with bounded nondeterministic and probabilistic choice.  We establish a deep connection between PAST and the termination of programs with (un)bounded nondeterminism and fair termination.  Specifically, we show that deciding PAST is Π<sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup>-complete, matching the complexity of termination for programs with countable nondeterminism.\n\nThis complexity result is further underscored by our construction, for each recursive ordinal *o* < Church-Kleene ordinal (CK<sub>1</sub>), of a probabilistic program *P*(*o*) such that *o* is well-founded if and only if *P*(*o*) is PAST.  This demonstrates that transfinite ordinals up to CK<sub>1</sub> are necessary for proving PAST.  This contrasts with Almost-Sure Termination (AST) and Bounded AST (BAST) which do not require transfinite reasoning.  Typically, AST and BAST proofs employ ranking supermartingales mapping program states to reals, demonstrating a minimum expected decrease with each transition.  Our work reveals that this approach is insufficient for PAST.  We illustrate this in Section 2 with a stochastic Hydra game, a PAST program requiring ordinals up to CK<sub>1</sub> to prove termination.  Since the complexity of valid statements in standard arithmetic is Δ<sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup>, relative completeness results for PAST necessitate more powerful proof systems.\n\nTo address this, we introduce a sound and complete proof rule for a special normal form, which we call *Knievel form*,  effectively constructible for any probabilistic program.  This proof rule uses two key components: a ranking function from program states to ordinals up to CK<sub>1</sub>, where only terminal states are ranked zero, and a state-dependent certificate based on ranking supermartingales, bounding the expected time to reach a lower-ranked state independent of the scheduler.\n\nThis proof rule is complete for *all* probabilistic programs: a suitable rank and certificate can always be extracted.  Crucially, soundness is guaranteed for Knievel form programs: the existence of a ranking function and supermartingale certificate implies bounded expected running time.  However, the rule is *not* sound for general programs.  Therefore, our complete proof system involves first transforming a program into Knievel form and then applying the proof rule.\n\nOur core results are summarized as follows:\n\n1. Deciding PAST for probabilistic programs with bounded nondeterministic and probabilistic choice is Π<sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup>-complete.\n\n2. For any probabilistic program *P*, there is an effectively constructible Knievel form program *P'* and non-probabilistic programs *P*<sub>1</sub> (bounded nondeterministic choice) and *P*<sub>2</sub> (unbounded choice) such that *P* is PAST iff *P'* is PAST iff *P*<sub>1</sub> is fairly terminating iff *P*<sub>2</sub> is terminating.\n\n3. For any recursive ordinal *o*, there is a probabilistic program *P*(*o*) such that *o* is well-founded iff *P*(*o*) is PAST. Hence, proving PAST requires ordinals up to CK<sub>1</sub>.\n\n4. There is a sound and complete proof rule for Knievel form programs using a ranking function to CK<sub>1</sub> and ranking supermartingales.  While complete for all PAST programs, the rule is sound only for programs in Knievel form.\n\nA probabilistic program augments an imperative program with primitives for randomization, enabling direct implementation of randomized computation and probabilistic modeling. Applications include machine learning, bioinformatics, epidemiology, and information retrieval (see Katoen et al. [2015])."}

{"text": "The advent of fifth-generation (5G) mobile communications in 2020 spurred global commercialization.  From 2G to 5G, communication frequency bands have increased from 100 MHz to the GHz range [1, 2], exploiting higher-frequency electromagnetic waves for greater spectral resources.  Further exploration of millimeter wave, terahertz, and optical communication is crucial for discovering new spectral resources [3–5].  While free-space optical (FSO) communication, visible light communication (VLC), and short-range near-infrared communication have been extensively studied and widely deployed, light waves are easily absorbed by opaque obstacles, limiting optical communication primarily to line-of-sight scenarios.  Moreover, higher-frequency signals like millimeter waves and terahertz waves increasingly exhibit characteristics similar to optical signals, such as narrow pulses and susceptibility to blockage [6–9], necessitating solutions to mitigate their impact on communication quality.\n\nReconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) offer a novel approach.  These meta-surfaces programmably modulate passing electromagnetic waves [10–13].  Current microwave-band RIS structures primarily comprise arrays of digital coding units, enabling adjustment of incident beams to control the intensity, phase, frequency, and polarity of outgoing beams.  Di and Zhang [12] proposed using RIS for microwave beamforming, effectively mimicking a large-scale base station antenna array directed towards multiple nodes in free space.  This approach reduces the burden on the base station, improves energy efficiency, and allows for the recollection and retransmission of previously unreceived microwave signals.\n\nAnalogous to microwave RIS, optical RIS structures require the following functionalities: (1) Reflecting the incident beam; (2) Preserving the original beam's information with minimal alteration; (3) Programmably controlling the intensity, phase, frequency, polarization, and other characteristics of the outgoing beam; (4) Precisely adjusting the outgoing beam's direction to track the user.\n\nExisting technologies like spatial light modulators (SLMs) and optical micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) address these requirements [14–17].  Proposed in 1982 [16], two-dimensional magneto-optic SLMs adjust the amplitude, phase, polarization, and other parameters of transmitted light.  Combined with lens groups, SLMs reconstruct light fields with minimal power loss.  Comprising digital coding unit arrays, SLMs allow programmable adjustment of incident light amplitude and phase at modulation frequencies up to 100 Hz.  SLMs have been employed for signal modulation in low-speed VLC systems [18] and for converting single beams into multiple beams to track multiple mobile users [19]. Optical MEMS, comprising arrays of adjustable micro-lenses, offer cost-effective and readily manufacturable solutions for controlling reflected light direction, but lack the ability to freely control the phase, frequency, and polarization of the outgoing beam.\n\nLeveraging optical RIS, we propose a controllable multi-branch wireless optical communication system with RIS in the channels, termed an optical intelligent channel communication system.  By deploying multiple optical RIS, or intelligent channel reconfigurable nodes (ICRNs), we create multiple artificial optical channels, or intelligent channels.  The system's intelligence lies in its ability to: (1) Track mobile users by coordinating the transmitter and ICRNs to direct the signal towards the user's receiver center; (2) Establish multiple controllable channels between the base station and users, with adjustable paths via ICRN selection; (3) Provide the base station with knowledge of each channel's physical path, enabling real-time channel state information (CSI) estimation; (4) Optimize power efficiency by dynamically allocating power to each channel based on CSI, ensuring communication stability.\n\nThis paper analyzes the performance of this system, assuming accurate beam alignment with the receiver center."}

{"text": "Venus, often called the \"Evening Star,\" presents a paradox.  While relatively close to Earth, it remains a hostile and unexplored world.  We haven't sent a spacecraft there in 30 years, and for good reason.  Its thick atmosphere, composed of 97% carbon dioxide and laced with corrosive sulfuric acid clouds, creates a hellish environment.  Surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit – hotter than any other planet in our solar system – and the atmospheric pressure is a crushing 90 times that of Earth. These conditions are far beyond anything humans can withstand.\n\nGiven this extreme environment, why return to Venus?  Astronomers believe that Venus may once have been Earth-like, potentially covered with oceans and capable of supporting life.  Even today, Venus exhibits familiar geological features like mountains and valleys, hinting at a more hospitable past.\n\nThis potential for discovery drives renewed interest in Venus exploration.  NASA is developing innovative solutions to overcome the challenges. One concept involves deploying a research station that would float approximately 30 miles above the surface, safe from the extreme ground conditions.  They are also investigating technologies like mechanically driven devices, inspired by World War II designs, capable of operating under high pressures and temperatures without electricity.\n\nThe allure of Venus lies in our innate human curiosity and drive to explore.  We possess boundless imaginations, and to truly progress as a civilization, we should strive to become a multi-planetary species.  Innovation and learning have propelled us from the first automobiles a century ago to where we are today.  Imagine the possibilities that await us in the next 100 years, perhaps including a deeper understanding of our enigmatic neighbor, Venus."}
{"text": "Neural network architectures are widely used in information retrieval, employing various strategies to represent and compare user queries with potential documents. This work focuses on enhancing document representation to improve retrieval quality and robustness.\n\nOne common approach is the Bi-encoder (Karpukhin et al., 2020), utilizing two transformer models (Vaswani et al., 2017) – which can be shared or separate – to encode queries and documents into vector representations. Similarity, often calculated using dot product or cosine similarity, is then computed between these vectors to determine relevance.\n\nContrastingly, Cross-encoders (Nogueira and Cho, 2019) combine query and document inputs early on, creating a joint embedding vector for relevance prediction. This deeper interaction often leads to superior performance compared to bi-encoders when nuanced understanding is crucial.\n\nBridging these two approaches are late-interaction models like ColBERT (Khattab and Zaharia, 2020), ColBERTv2 (Santhanam et al., 2021), and SPALDE++ (Formal et al., 2022).  These models independently encode queries and documents into token-level vectors, resembling a \"bag of embeddings\" approach.  The \"late interaction\" occurs when cosine similarity or dot product scores are calculated across these token-level vectors.\n\nAll these architectures rely on informative embeddings of both queries and documents.  While query content is beyond our control during retrieval, we can enrich document embeddings, which is the core hypothesis driving this work.\n\nTo this end, we propose LLM-augmented retrieval, a model-agnostic framework designed to enhance document embeddings with richer contextual information.  A key component is the introduction of *doc-level embedding*, which further integrates contextual information.\n\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n\n1. The LLM-augmented retrieval framework, improving the quality and robustness of existing retrieval models.\n2. The doc-level embedding approach for richer contextual representation.\n3. Comprehensive evaluation across various models and datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance exceeding original models.\n4. Enhancements to key retrieval model training components, including negative sampling and loss functions."}
{"text": "The article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" presents a compelling case for autonomous vehicles as a revolutionary technology.  However, the author questions the reliability of these systems and their potential impact on safety.  Will driver-assist features function flawlessly, or will their failures lead to even greater dangers?  Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google, champions driverless cars as the future of transportation, a paradigm shift from the dream of flying cars. Brin believes this technology will fundamentally reshape the world.  Despite the excitement surrounding autonomous vehicles, the author argues against their adoption.  While acknowledging the allure of technological advancements, the author contends that the complex systems within driverless cars are inherently prone to failure, ultimately jeopardizing driver safety.\n\nA central concern is the potential for manufacturers to downplay the risks of driverless technology. Will the public receive a balanced perspective, or will negative aspects be suppressed? The author fears that driverless cars will prove to be another technological misstep.  Quoting the original article, the author highlights the inherent limitations of autonomous systems: \"They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills.\"  This requirement for driver vigilance is further emphasized: \"This means the human driver must remain alert.\" The author argues this dependence on human intervention undermines the very concept of a driverless car, exposing a fundamental flaw in the technology.  Drivers, lulled into a false sense of security, may become distracted or drowsy, unprepared for the sudden need to take control. This reliance on imperfect human intervention increases the risk of accidents.  Overconfidence in the technology could lead to dangerous situations, such as intoxicated individuals relying on the car to navigate them safely home, potentially endangering themselves and others if the system fails.\n\nFurther concerns arise regarding the reliability of driver-assist functions.  The article mentions GM's development of vibrating seats to alert drivers of danger.  However, the author questions the long-term functionality of such systems and the driver's ability to respond appropriately.  Who, the author asks, actually reads instruction manuals thoroughly?  The excitement surrounding new technology may lead to drivers neglecting proper training, creating hazardous situations on the road.  Trying to learn complex systems while driving could exacerbate risks and lead to panic in emergencies.  The author predicts a rise in accident rates, counteracting efforts to improve road safety.\n\nLiability in the event of an accident involving a driverless car is another key concern.  The author believes that the human driver, rather than the manufacturer, will likely be held responsible, even if the accident stems from technological failure.  This raises questions about fairness and accountability in the age of autonomous vehicles.\n\nThe author concludes by reiterating the potential dangers of driverless cars and urging caution.  Would you, the author asks, entrust your loved ones to a technology with such inherent risks?  Instead of improving road safety, the author argues that driverless cars will likely increase accident and fatality rates.  For these reasons, the author believes driverless cars should not be embraced as the future of transportation."}

{"text": "Additive manufacturing (AM), commonly known as 3-D printing, has experienced rapid growth in popularity and market share due to its ability to create complex geometries with engineering properties that often meet or exceed those of conventionally manufactured parts, while significantly reducing overhead costs [1] [2] [3].  One such AM process, Powder Bed Fusion (PBF), builds three-dimensional parts layer by layer from metal powder (Fig. 1). The PBF process involves a three-stage build cycle: 1) spreading a thin layer of powder over a base plate or previously deposited layer, 2) selectively melting the powder into the desired pattern using a high-powered laser or electron beam (e-beam), and 3) lowering the build platform to allow for the next layer of powder.\n\nDespite its advantages, PBF presents challenges.  Parts manufactured via PBF often exhibit high levels of residual stresses [5] [6] [7], porosity [8] [9] [10], and anisotropy in material properties [2, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14]. These defects stem directly from the thermal management of the PBF process.  Currently, PBF machines operate in open-loop, with the irradiated energy, *u*, dictated by a G-Code schedule [15].  The parameters governing this schedule are determined through operator experience, heuristic design-of-experiment procedures [16], or computationally intensive predictive models [17].  Feedback control of the thermal management process could significantly improve the quality of PBF-manufactured parts.\n\nWhile the need for improved thermal management in PBF is recognized, the controllability and observability of the process—fundamental criteria for modern control synthesis—remain unestablished. This paper addresses this fundamental gap.  Our analysis considers both current and emerging thermal actuation and sensing hardware capabilities, without regard for computational constraints during model construction.  The goal is to establish a controls theoretic foundation for PBF, enabling the application of modern control tools such as multivariable robust controllers, state estimators, and fault detection schemes to this important and evolving manufacturing technology.  Throughout this paper, we use the nomenclature defined in Table 1."}

{"text": "## Restructured Text for Improved Flow and Coherence\n\nRemote sensing technology plays a vital role in monitoring and understanding the dynamic interplay between human activities and the Earth's ecosystems.  By providing large-scale, long-term, and periodic observations of the Earth's surface, it enables the study of ecosystem changes and their societal impacts (Coppin et al., 2004).  Detecting land-cover changes from multi-temporal remote sensing images, acquired by spaceborne and airborne platforms, has become a central focus in the field (Tewkesbury et al., 2015; Zhu, 2017).\n\nNumerous change detection approaches have been developed, reflecting the technology's long history.  Traditional methods, predating deep learning, can be broadly categorized into four types: image algebra, image transformation, post-classification comparison, and other advanced methods. Image algebra methods, such as change vector analysis (CVA) (Bovolo and Bruzzone, 2007; Bruzzone and Diego Fernàndez Prieto, 2000; Du et al., 2020), directly compare spectral bands of bitemporal images to measure change intensity. Image transformation methods, including multivariate alteration detection (MAD) (Nielsen et al., 1998), principal component analysis (PCA) (Celik, 2009; Deng et al., 2008), slow feature analysis (SFA) (Wu et al., 2014), and Fourier transform (Chen et al., 2023), transform raw image features into a new feature space to highlight change-relevant information. Post-classification comparison methods involve classifying images from different times and then comparing the resulting classification maps (Xian et al., 2009). Other advanced methods leverage machine learning models like support vector machines (Bovolo et al., 2008), conditional random fields (Hoberg et al., 2015), Markov random fields (Kasetkasem and Varshney, 2002), and object-based image analysis (OBIA) (Gil-Yepes et al., 2016; Hussain et al., 2013).\n\nThe advent of deep learning has revolutionized change detection, offering improved efficiency and accuracy in analyzing multi-temporal imagery (Shi et al., 2020).  These methods can be categorized as supervised or unsupervised, depending on the use of annotated data. Unsupervised deep learning methods typically focus on extracting spatial-spectral features from multi-temporal images and then calculating change intensity. Examples include using deep belief networks (DBN) (Zhang et al., 2016a), autoencoders (Bergamasco et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2016b), deep CVA (DCVA) (Saha et al., 2019), and various specialized neural network architectures (Liu et al., 2020, 2022; Wu et al., 2022).  Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been employed to capture nonlocal dependencies in multi-temporal images (Chen et al., 2022c; Tang et al., 2022; Kipf and Welling, 2016). However, unsupervised methods face limitations due to the lack of training labels, potentially leading to suboptimal feature extraction and hindering the use of complex architectures.

Las denuncias contra el ex productor de Hollywood dieron paso a otras acusaciones similares contra figuras del cine, los medios de comunicación y la política.  En mayo de 2018, Weinstein se entregó a las autoridades de Nueva York para enfrentar los cargos en su contra.  Un grupo de mujeres, incluyendo a la actriz Louisette Geiss, presentó una acción legal colectiva en su contra, acusándolo de dirigir una operación de tráfico sexual entre 1993 y 2011.  Según el Daily News,  diez mujeres se unieron a la demanda en 2017, alegando que Weinstein las atraía a encuentros privados con la promesa de empleo en Hollywood.\n\nEste jueves, un juez federal del distrito sur de Nueva York, Alvin Hellerstein, permitió que la demanda por tráfico sexual contra Weinstein continúe.  Sin embargo, Hellerstein decidió que Weinstein Co., Miramax, sus ejecutivos, directores, y el hermano del productor, Robert Weinstein, quedan fuera de la demanda.  El juez argumentó que estas partes no se beneficiaron de la presunta conducta del productor.\n\n“La corte decidió correctamente que Harvey Weinstein deberá enfrentar el cargo de tráfico sexual, que usó su poder para engañar y manipular mujeres, sabiendo que intentaba abusar sexualmente de ellas”, declaró al Daily News Elizabeth Fergan, abogada de las demandantes.

{"text": "Generative artificial intelligence (genAI) holds transformative potential across diverse fields, from computer science and creative arts to language processing. While its efficacy is proven in areas like medicine and healthcare, its application in engineering domains, specifically urban planning and architectural design, remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by exploring the use of genAI, particularly generative design methodologies, for intervention planning in urban environments.\n\nUrban green space (UGS) availability is crucial for the health and well-being of urban residents. Studies show beneficial associations between green space exposure and reduced stress, improved mood, better mental health, and decreased psychological distress, particularly in adolescents [14]. However, significant disparities exist in UGS accessibility between Northern and Southern European cities, with the former enjoying above-average availability and the latter facing below-average access [7].  This underscores the need for innovative intervention planning strategies, which this paper aims to address through genAI.\n\nGenerative design, employing advanced algorithms and computational techniques, offers a systematic approach to automating the design process.  By defining parameters and constraints, generative design can produce numerous design scenarios.  This research extends its application to multi-scale intervention planning, encompassing architectural design and urban revitalization, to harness genAI's potential for transforming urban landscapes.\n\nThe primary objective is to showcase the potential of generative AI models in these applications.  We introduce a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) Desktop application developed for generating images and implementing generative design in real-world scenarios.  Through experimentation and case studies, we demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this technology for intervention planning, offering insights into its practical implications for shaping future urban environments.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a literature review; Section 3 describes the experimental setup; Section 4 presents the results; and Section 5 concludes the work."}

Our best guess is a few years after the Great Doom, when the outside world was destroyed and our store became the only remaining sanctuary.

Division and mistrust are so embedded here, there is great doubt if the store could ever run again, all the sections in harmony, operating the massive commercial outpost it was before.\n\nIn response to a milk shortage after the Doom, Dairy raised their prices astronomically, prompting Pharmacy to do the same. That was the final straw. Butter and milk are one thing, but when no one can afford antibiotics, it's just a matter of time until everything exploded. Sporting Goods and Automotive, already militaristic due to their access to dangerous weapons and equipment, aligned and struck the first blow.  They invaded and annexed Pharmacy – a pill bottle is no match for Tire Knights armed with rifles and hunting knives.  A deal with Grocery – food for medicine – quickly established the three factions as the dominant alliance.\n\nBut it didn't last. It never does. Legend says black-hat operatives from Electronics staged a false flag operation, framing Automotive for stealing weapons and trading them to Fashion for clothing, which they then resold to Sporting Goods.

{"text": "The odd thing about teleporting is that it’s not instantaneous. Depending on the distance, materializing on the other side takes anywhere from 10 to 1,000 seconds. This usually leaves plenty of time to contemplate your purpose – or to simply zone out, as I tended to do.  The process involves a gradual coalescence, a slow return to wholeness, culminating in the world snapping into focus just as the attendant frantically waves you off the pad. This, much to my embarrassment, was precisely my experience upon arriving at New Hope Medical Clinic in Pennsylvania.\n\nAfter my clumsy dismount, I exchanged greetings with the attendant, confirmed my appointment with the pretty, blonde receptionist, and then followed an orderly to Professor Alan Templeton's room.  Templeton, the brilliant mind behind the teleportation device I’d just used, had tragically succumbed to madness shortly after its creation. His psychosis, fixated on straight lines and sharp angles, remained a baffling enigma.\n\nOver the years, others had developed similar symptoms, leading to the official designation of \"Transporter Psychosis.\"  Affecting roughly one in a billion people, it was statistically safer than air travel, with only twenty-six cases recorded across Earth and the Colonies.\n\nAs we neared Templeton's room, the orderly diverted me into a smaller antechamber. “Put these on, please,” he instructed, proffering a set of oddly-shaped clothes.\n\n“Excuse me?” I questioned, slightly offended.  My tweed jacket and slacks might be a bit dated, but surely not grounds for a forced wardrobe change.\n\n“It’s the lines, sir,” the orderly explained with a weary sigh. “Your clothes have straight lines.”\n\nI glanced down at my attire, then at the garments he held.  Even the stitching flowed in curves, eschewing any hint of linearity.  With a nod of understanding, I changed. The orderly, satisfied, then guided me to a rounded door at the hallway's end. “Fifteen minutes, sir.”\n\nThe room itself was a dome, every corner smoothed and rounded.  Professor Templeton, his white hair carefully combed back, sat perched on a beanbag chair, scribbling on circular paper.  His aversion to straight lines was clearly no exaggeration.\n\n“Come in, come in,” he beckoned, gesturing towards another beanbag. “Another vulture to inquire about Transporter Psychosis, I presume?”\n\n“Uh, yes?” I stammered, surprised by his seemingly lucid demeanor.\n\nHe fixed me with a steady gaze. “Of course I seem sane. Now sit and ask your questions.” He returned to his scribbling.\n\nAs I settled onto the beanbag, attempting to formulate my questions, Templeton abruptly thrust his hand in front of my face, holding up four fingers. “How many fingers do you see?”\n\n“Uh, four?”\n\nHe huffed. “Bah, four. Just like the rest of them.”\n\n“Wrong answer?” I inquired, bewildered.\n\nHe waved his hand dismissively. “You see, but you don’t *really* see. Now ask your questions.”\n\nI discreetly activated my hidden recorder. “Professor, for the record, could you please verify your identity?”\n\nA frown deepened on his face.  “Professor Alan Templeton, professor of Theoretical Physics, inventor of the Teleporter. Born August 31st, 2025. I have a mole on my left ass cheek known only to my mother, my wife, and four women in Barcelona.”  His unexpected candor startled me into an awkward laugh, which I quickly stifled, realizing he was entirely serious.\n\n“Professor, your psychosis—”\n\n“It’s not a psychosis!” he roared, leaping to his feet and pacing. “You reporters are vultures, feasting on my words, but none of you truly listen! The lines!” he shouted, pointing beyond the door. “The lines are the problem, not me!”\n\nEmboldened, I ventured, “But what about sharp angles?"}

{"text": "In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author argues compellingly for further study of our neighboring planet despite the acknowledged difficulties presented by its hostile environment.  The author builds this argument by highlighting several key benefits of Venusian exploration.\n\nThe author begins by establishing the close relationship between Earth and Venus.  \"Often referred to as Earth's 'twin,' Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too.\" This similarity, the author suggests, makes Venus an invaluable subject for comparative planetology. Understanding Venus, particularly its dramatic shift from a potentially habitable world – \"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth\" –  to its current state, can offer crucial insights into Earth's own evolution and future.\n\nBeyond scientific understanding, the author frames Venusian exploration as a necessary step in human progress.  \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.”  The inherent challenges of studying Venus, rather than being deterrents, are presented as opportunities to push the boundaries of human ingenuity.  This pursuit of knowledge in the face of adversity is portrayed as essential for growth and advancement.\n\nFinally, the author contends that overcoming the obstacles of Venus exploration has broader implications for space travel."}
{"text": "Discourse parsing aims to unveil the logical structure of a text by identifying and labeling relations between discourse units (See Fig. 1 and Fig. 2).  Several discourse schemes, such as Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Carlson et al., 2001) and PDTB (Prasad et al., 2008), guide the development of various discourse corpora. However, the complex and labor-intensive nature of text-level discourse annotation results in relatively small corpora compared to other NLP tasks.  This data sparsity poses a significant challenge.\n\nOne approach to address this sparsity is multi-task learning, training on multiple corpora simultaneously.  Previous multi-task learning efforts primarily focused on classifying discourse relations between two text spans (Liu et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017) rather than considering the entire discourse structure. This limited scope stems from the principle that multi-task learning requires closely related tasks.  However, discourse structures vary significantly across corpora, ranging from shallow predicate-argument structures (e.g., Fig. 1) to deep tree structures (e.g., the CDTB tree in Fig. 2).\n\nThis work explores an alternative approach: unifying existing discourse corpora under a single framework to create a larger, more comprehensive dataset. We chose the dependency discourse structure (DDS) as our unifying framework. In DDS, elementary discourse units (EDUs) are directly linked without considering intermediate spans.  Morey et al. (2018) argue that DDS offers a general discourse representation, demonstrating its utility by evaluating the English discourse corpus RST-DT (Carlson et al., 2001) and related parsing techniques from a dependency perspective.\n\nOur research investigates the feasibility of this unification, focusing on two key questions: (i) How can diverse discourse structures be converted into DDS? (ii) How can this unified data best improve discourse parsing techniques?\n\nGuided by these questions, we unified three Chinese discourse corpora: HIT-CDTB (Zhang et al., 2014), SU-CDTB (Li et al., 2014b), and Sci-CDTB (Cheng and Li, 2019). HIT-CDTB employs a predicate-argument structure similar to PDTB, with connectives as predicates and text spans as arguments.  SU-CDTB, following RST, uses a hierarchical tree structure, with EDUs as leaves and connectives as intermediate nodes. Sci-CDTB, a small-scale corpus of 108 scientific abstracts, is, to our knowledge, the only existing Chinese DDS corpus.\n\nUnifying these corpora presented several challenges, including inconsistencies in EDU granularity and relation type definitions.  Furthermore, HIT-CDTB's predicate-argument structure sometimes omits relations between adjacent spans, potentially resulting in incomplete dependency structures.  To address these issues, we redefined EDU granularity, mapped different relation sets, and developed semi-automatic conversion methods.  These methods involved automatic dependency tree transformation for each corpus followed by manual proofreading to ensure consistent EDU segmentation, supplement missing information, and correct transformed dependency trees.\n\nUnlike Morey et al. (2018), who focused solely on RST-to-DDS conversion, we unified multiple discourse schemes into the dependency framework and explored how this unified data could improve discourse parsing.  We implemented several discourse dependency parsers and conducted experiments to assess their performance with the unified data, leading to insights on how to best leverage this resource."}

{"text": "Smart, or driverless, cars are often touted as the future of transportation.  However, I believe they belong only in the future, and not on our current roads. While seemingly appealing to some, particularly those unable to drive due to disabilities, the current reality of these vehicles presents significant concerns.\n\nThe core functions of these \"smart cars\" involve steering, accelerating, and braking – tasks any competent human driver can already perform.  While features like heads-up displays offer potential benefits, their effectiveness relies entirely on driver attentiveness.  If the driver isn't engaged, these features become irrelevant, negating any perceived advantage.\n\nThe question of liability in accidents involving autonomous vehicles is complex. If a smart car is involved in a collision due to a faulty system, the responsibility should fall squarely on the manufacturer.  This raises a crucial point: if system failures can lead to accidents, these cars may introduce more danger than benefit.  Google's announcement of its first smart car accident on March 1, 2016, underscores this concern."}
{"text": "The intersection of neuroscience and game research has emerged as a fertile ground for innovation in the past decade, mirroring the historically fruitful relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) and games.  Just as games have served as testing grounds for AI, pushing the boundaries of algorithms while AI enhances game design and player experience, neuroscience and games are now engaged in a similar synergistic dance.  Figure 1 illustrates this burgeoning field, showing a significant increase in publications on Scopus since 2010, with 1245 articles identified using relevant keywords, indicating a rapidly growing body of research.\n\nThis synergy manifests in several key areas.  First, similar to how AI draws inspiration from the brain, game research, particularly player experience research, benefits from neuroscience tools like EEG and fMRI. These tools offer objective measurements of cognitive activity, providing insights into player engagement, challenge, and stress [3, 4, 5].  Conversely, games offer neuroscience valuable platforms for studying cognitive processes in engaging, controlled environments.  Researchers use games as simulations to explore attention, memory, and decision-making [6, 7], collecting real-time data on player actions and neural responses. Games also hold potential for neurofeedback training, allowing players to regulate their brain activity [8].\n\nSecond, as gaming's cultural impact grows, understanding its effects on the brain becomes crucial.  Research investigates the potential of games to enhance cognitive abilities like decision-making [9] and visual attention [10], while also examining potential negative consequences [11].\n\nFinally, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) represent a third exciting area of convergence.  Initially focused on medical applications, BCIs are now expanding into games and entertainment, promising increased accessibility and novel interaction paradigms [12, 13, 14]. BCIs allow players to control games using brain signals, offering new possibilities for both \"abled\" and disabled gamers [15, 16]. This technology enables non-intrusive interaction and even real-time game adaptation based on the player's cognitive state [17].  Games, in turn, provide engaging environments for BCI development and training, offering diverse scenarios and motivating user participation [18].\n\nWhile challenges remain, including ethical considerations, data privacy, and robust calibration, the potential of this interdisciplinary field is vast. Personalized gaming experiences, therapeutic interventions, and inclusive design are just a few of the possibilities.  The following sections will delve deeper into these areas, exploring the state-of-the-art, addressing open challenges, and identifying future opportunities."}

Je sais que notre ami commun, juste à côté de ces sanglots déchirants, pense lui aussi qu’il vaut mieux préparer notre propre clé USB de notre vivant, avant que nos familles endeuillées ne compilent nos pires photos et nos moments les plus honteux.  Il faudrait penser à enregistrer nos voix, pour quand il ne restera plus que le silence.\n\nJ’ai du mal à entendre qu’il s’est *donné* la mort, comme s’il s’était offert un cadeau, alors qu’en réalité, il s’est *ôté* la vie. La colère monte en moi en apprenant qu’il travaillait dans cette entreprise où l'on encourageait cyniquement les départs « par la fenêtre ». S’il a bien été le bourreau de sa propre existence, le commanditaire, lui, est ailleurs, bien à l’abri, prospérant sur le sang et les os de milliers d’autres comme lui.\n\n« Ce qui est néfaste pour le psychisme, c’est la contrainte inhérente à l’organisation du travail.  Contraintes doubles : d’une part, la division technique des tâches, soumise à des prescriptions strictes ; d’autre part, la division politique du travail,  système de surveillance et de sanctions.  Depuis Taylor et Ford, l’organisation du travail est essentiellement politique. Taylor compare l’ouvrier à un chimpanzé  sommé d’obéir aveuglément. Cette conception, fondée sur la domination, le contrôle et la sanction (donc la peur), est évidemment néfaste pour la santé mentale."}

{"text": "The blinding headlights cut through the dark, stormy atmosphere.  A deafening crash, the crunch of metal against bone—I felt the impact against my small body, yet pain was absent. Numbness, a perverse benefit of this afflicted state. Lying on the cold, hard, wet road, life ebbed away, breath shallowing as the distant wail of a siren faded into the encroaching darkness.\n\nThen, abruptly, my eyes fluttered open. I could breathe again. I was sitting on something soft, comfortable, white.  Gone were my torn, dirty clothes, replaced by skinny jeans and black Converse, the uniform of my high school days.  As my vision cleared, I saw a small bed in a blue bedroom, adorned with trophies and awards. Muffled music and voices drifted from somewhere beyond.  A wave of déjà vu washed over me, unsettlingly familiar.\n\nAcross the room, in a similar bed, lay my ex-husband, looking a decade younger.  The dark circles, the scabs on his face and arms—all gone. He looked sober, healthy, a sight unseen for twelve long years.  He opened his eyes, caught my gaze, and a mischievous grin spread across his face. He rose, walked over, and stood at the edge of my bed, leaning in.  With a chuckle, he reached into his jeans pocket, pulling out a pipe and a small baggie filled with what I instantly recognized as meth.\n\n\"Try some,\" he said. \"It won't hurt.\""}

{"text": "Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) have been proposed in the literature (Kiess and Mauve 2007, Reina et al. 2015, Mohammed and Al-Ghrairi 2019) as a communication technology for emergencies and disasters.  Cellular-based infrastructures may become unavailable due to significant damage in such situations.  MANETs, however, can be rapidly deployed without fixed infrastructure, setup, or prior requirements. This flexibility is particularly attractive when communication between victims and rescue teams is crucial.  A key challenge in MANET implementation is demonstrating sufficient reliability compared to other approaches (Kiess and Mauve 2007).  Real-world verification and validation (V&V) under emergency conditions is virtually impossible, making simulation a vital tool in MANET research.\n\nSimulators offer a cost-effective way to evaluate the performance and accuracy of algorithms and systems without requiring actual hardware. They also enable the assessment of network capacity under extreme conditions by virtually varying parameters and exploring different scenarios (Manpreet and Malhotra 2014).  However, despite increased development and usage, the credibility of simulator results has declined over time (Kurkowski et al. 2005, Hogie et al. 2006).  Some of the challenges encountered in MANET development (arXiv:2004.14093v1 [cs.DC] 29 Apr 2020) are inherent to simulation in general: repeatability, consistency, and model accuracy (Sargent 2001).  Simulators often focus on specific aspects of the network structure itself, neglecting the complexity and heterogeneity of the systems that rely on it, such as autonomous vehicles, unmanned aircraft systems, and communication software.\n\nFigure 1 illustrates a real-world example of a MANET-based ecosystem in an emergency. Collaborative drones operating in a complex environment must communicate without fixed infrastructure, transmitting data to rescue teams equipped with mobile devices running real-time 3D processing software. This allows professionals to assess the situation.  The data should also be stored in an internet-connected database to enable informed decision-making by management teams.  Decision support can be further enhanced through AI-driven decision-making processes (Phillips-Wren and Jain 2006).  Ideally, verification and simulation of the entire ecosystem should consider all aspects and characteristics of the various devices and disaster scenarios. While fully achieving this is impossible, abstraction is a recognized challenge, particularly in MANET simulation (Hogie et al."}
{"text": "El Cádiz CF, tras empatar el pasado viernes ante el líder Granada, acaba la primera vuelta del campeonato en una ilusionante séptima posición, a un solo paso de la zona de fase de ascenso. Con 33 puntos en el ecuador de la temporada, el conjunto amarillo se encuentra a tan solo dos puntos del sexto y quinto clasificado, Osasuna y Alcorcón respectivamente (ambos con 35), y a tres del cuarto, el Deportivo de la Coruña (36).  El Cádiz depende de sí mismo para escalar puestos en una Liga que se presenta con la presunción de máxima igualdad en esta segunda etapa, donde todo está por decidir.\n\nLas próximas jornadas serán cruciales para definir el objetivo por el que lucharán los gaditanos. El cuadro entrenado por Álvaro Cervera acecha a varios rivales directos que le preceden en la tabla, pero también siente la presión de sus inmediatos perseguidores.  El Mallorca, en octava posición, también suma 33 puntos. El Oviedo, tras dos victorias consecutivas, asoma con 30 puntos en el noveno escalón, dispuesto a pujar por el play-off.  El Almería, décimo con 29, intenta engancharse a la batalla en las alturas, y será el próximo rival del Cádiz el sábado a las cuatro de la tarde en el estadio Juegos del Mediterráneo.  Les siguen Las Palmas con 28 puntos (undécimo) y el Sporting de Gijón con 27 (duodécimo).\n\nA pesar de la apretada competencia, el Cádiz puede respirar tranquilo.  Mantiene una diferencia de 12 puntos sobre la zona de descenso, que queda muy lejos antes del inicio de la segunda vuelta.  El conjunto gaditano, por lo tanto, tiene todo por decidir y dependerá de su rendimiento en cada fin de semana para hilar fino y alcanzar sus objetivos."}

Avec son compagnon, Raphaël Lancrey-Javal, la réalisatrice a accueilli un petit garçon prénommé Léo Jean Didier, en hommage à son père, Johnny Hallyday (Jean-Philippe Léo Smet de son vrai nom).  Très discrète sur sa vie familiale, Laura Smet n'a fait aucun commentaire sur son quotidien transformé par l'arrivée de son bébé.\n\nHeureusement, la grand-mère du petit Léo, Nathalie Baye, vient de donner des nouvelles du garçonnet.  Dans une interview accordée à *Gala* à l'occasion de la sortie de la série britannique *Abbey*, l'actrice de 72 ans explique combien sa fille Laura Smet est devenue une « vraie maman ». « Elle est extrêmement heureuse avec son petit Léo, qui est une merveille.  Âgé de sept mois, c'est un bébé tranquille qui fait d'elle une maman vraiment attentive et très sereine. Elle recommence tout juste à avoir envie de retourner sur les plateaux de tournage », confie-t-elle. Après de précieux mois passés à pouponner loin du tumulte de la pandémie, Laura Smet semble impatiente de retrouver son clap de réalisatrice.\n\nDe son côté, Nathalie Baye savoure pleinement son rôle de grand-mère, contrairement à Johnny Hallyday qui avait déclaré : « Déjà que j'ai eu du mal parfois à être père, alors grand-père, n'en parlons pas. » « Johnny était attaché à l'idée d'incarner une éternelle jeunesse. Moi, je suis très heureuse d'être grand-mère. Et Laura sait qu'elle peut compter sur moi », souligne Nathalie Baye.\n\nL'actrice de *Juste la fin du monde* n'aspire désormais qu'à une chose : « Être une bonne grand-mère. »  « Les miennes étaient particulièrement merveilleuses, joyeuses, et me faisaient faire des tas de choses. J'espère surtout rassurer ma fille lorsqu'elle devra se séparer de son enfant », avait-elle confié à *Madame Figaro* en octobre 2020.  Le petit Léo, qui a forcément hérité d'un ADN artistique, pourra peut-être en témoigner d'ici quelques années…\n\nRetrouvez l'intégralité de l'interview de Nathalie Baye dans le dernier numéro de *Gala*."}
