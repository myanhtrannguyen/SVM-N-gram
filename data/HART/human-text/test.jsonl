By reading the muscle movements in the face this computer software can tell how you are feeling. I believe that the technology of reading students emotional expressions is valuable in the class room because it can see when a student is confused and help like an actual instructor, if you get bored and the computer can read that from your expression it can help keep you on track, and having computers that can read expressions can be helpful when there is not enough teacher help in the classroom.\r\n\r\nThe computer technology can effectivley see when a student is bored and can help like as if an actual instructor was there. For example, if you find yourself bored and drifting off the computer can detect that to keep you up and focused on the task at hand. Having that computer there to keep you up can be very helpful to you as a student and the teachers. This shows how this technology could be valuable in the classroom.\r\n\r\nHaving something that is right in front of you that can help whenever you're confused can be very helpful. So say I'm in math class and I get confused on a problem. The computrer can sense that I am confused and do something to help me until the instructor is avalible. You could also be listening to a new topic and get cnfused and the computer could see that and pop up with some quick tips or facts to help you out.This kind of help could be very valuable to students and instructors.\r\n\r\nHaving computers in the classroom that can read expressions can be helpful when there isn't enough teacher help around. For example, if a teacher has a large class and there isnt anyone else in the room that can help out the computers could take that over."}

{"text": "An enduring challenge in building and maintaining task-oriented dialog (TOD) systems is efficiently adapting to a new task or domain. For instance, if we were to add the ability to book flight tickets to an existing system that can only handle booking train tickets, this requires new conversations about flight booking to be manually collected and labelled, as well as retraining of natural language understanding (NLU) and policy models. These data efficiency and scaling problems compound for multi-task TOD systems, as each task may have its 1 The STARV2 dataset will be released soon. own bespoke ontology and policy.\nTo tackle this problem, we propose ANYTOD, an end-to-end TOD system that can be programmed to support unseen tasks or domains without prior training, significantly speeding up the TOD design process by easing data collection and training requirements. To the best of our knowledge, ANY-TOD is the first end-to-end TOD system capable of zero-shot transfer. To this end, we view TOD as a program that a language model (LM) must execute throughout a conversation, and can rely on to provide guidance. Any predefined task policy, implemented as a program, can be used to control ANYTOD, allowing arbitrary business logic to be executed for a specific task. To demonstrate the efficacy of this paradigm, we experiment with the STAR (Mehri and Eskenazi, 2021) , ABCD (Chen et al., 2021) , SGD (Rastogi et al., 2020) and Mul-tiWoZ (Eric et al., 2019) benchmarks. Not only does ANYTOD achieve state-of-the-art results in full-shot settings, it also achieves high accuracy in zero-shot setups.\nOverview of ANYTOD To adhere to a given program, ANYTOD adopts a neuro-symbolic approach (Figure 1 ). A neural LM is trained for zeroshot dialog state tracking (DST) and action state tracking (AST), abstracting both states and actions into a sequence of symbols. To support zero-shot, we follow the schema-guided paradigm advocated by Rastogi et al. (2020) , and provide a schema to the LM as contextual information, describing all parameters and actions that should be tracked in natural language. By training on a large corpus of diverse schemas, the LM generalizes to arbitrary and unseen schemas (Lee et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2022) ."}

{"text": "Ensuring the safe operations of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is essential for their broad acceptance and public trust. Verification and validation are crucial to the safety of AV systems at all stages of their development from simulations to on-road testing. Conventional testing methods often require the existence of known scenarios which will later be used for verifying the AVs at the system level. Identifying such scenarios in different operational design domains (ODD) (SAE, 2018) is of a great challenge due to many possible variants that can occur in reality (Beringhoff et al., 2022) .\nAn emerging approach, namely, adaptive stress testing (AST), can address this challenge using the bottom up perspective (Corso et al., 2019; Lytskjold and Mengshoel, 2023; Hjelmeland et al., 2022) . The goal of this approach is to identify potential failure scenarios and their likelihoods of occurrences. In particular, it is designed to discover the most probable system failure events, which are traditionally formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) (Ritchie et al., 2015; Mark et al., 2018) . In this process, Reinforcement learning (RL) is often employed in conjunction with domain knowledge to efficiently explore the vast state space and identify failure events. To this end, the search process is guided by a reward function that encourages failures such as collisions and near-misses with a high transition probability.\nIn the literature, it has recently been used to explore the failure patterns of the intelligent driving model (IDM) under test (Zhang et al., 2023) . Prior to the application in self-driving in traffic, AST has shown great successes in numerous other relating applications, including the evaluation of aircraft collision avoidance (Ritchie et al., 2015) , maritime collision avoidance (Hjelmeland et al., 2022; Lytskjold and Mengshoel, 2023) , and autonomous vehicle pedestrian collision avoidance (Mark et al., 2018; Koren et al., 2020; Corso et al., 2019; Mark and Mykel, 2019; Mark et al., 2021) .\nNevertheless, the existing AST-based studies for AV driving have several limitations. First, the scenarios used for testing are basic, which does not include complexity of real-life driving situations. For example, Mark et al. (2018) used a simple scenario, in which the intelligent ego vehicle approaching a crosswalk where a pedestrian is crossing in front of it, to test an IDM that monitors the closest traffic participant to determine a safe distance and imminent collisions without having or taking into account the actions of surrounding vehicles. Second, the traditional IDMs under test are simple and do not account for sophisticated, realistic behaviours in driving. To address this limitation, Peter and Katherine (2021) proposed an IDM with more complex actions such as changing lanes, accelerating, decelerating, and maintaining a constant speed which are incorporated into a Deep Q Network (DQN) (Fan et al., 2020) model. However, these actions were constrained within the AV moving forward along the longitudinal direction only and without considering lateral movements.\nTo fill these gaps, in this study, we propose a novel AST framework based on the development of a comprehensive IDM model to reflect a realistic and complex driving environment on a highway. The proposed framework addresses both the above-mentioned limitations. Our main contributions are summarized as follows.\n• Develop a unified intelligent driving model (uIDM) that facilitate the movement of AV in both longitudinal and lateral directions. The uIDM enables the testing of autonomous driving in a much more realistic and complex scenarios.\n• Propose a novel AST framework to stress test the AV in a complex highway environment. Our framework includes a new reward function which encourages safe driving among other vehicles in the highway while supporting the identification of potential crashed scenarios.\n• Calibrate the framework using observations from California's accident reports and then assess its performance against existing IDMs, which later highlight the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed framework.\nThe rest of our paper is organized as follows."}

{"text": "Biological systems are represented as intricate networks of molecules such as genes, proteins, and metabolites interacting with each other [39] . Uncovering potential properties of biological networks provide opportunities for gaining insights on fundamental principles that govern living organisms. In these networks, frequently recurring subgraphs are referred to as motifs. Motifs serve as building blocks of large and complicated biological networks [25] . Studying motifs is significant as it can reveal functions of biological systems such as transcriptional regulation networks [34, 3] or protein interaction networks [38, 14] .\nMotif identification remains a computationally challenging problem as it involves solving the subgraph isomorphism, which is an NP-hard problem [10] . As the volume of biological data continues to grow rapidly, it will be more computationally expensive to explore motifs in biological networks. Enforcing specific regulatory constraints on interactions, such as activation or repression patterns on the motif topology, further increases the computation time needed to find motifs.\nIn literature, there are three well-known measures for counting motifs, namely F 1 , F 2 , and F 3 [33] . F 1 measures counts every isomorphic subgraph of a target network to a given motif pattern with no restrictions [15, 21, 26, 37, 8, 20] . Although F 1 provides a comprehensive view on all possible embeddings of motif patterns on networks, it fails to capture dependencies among motif embeddings. In addition, F 1 does not satisfy the downward closure property [33] , which can lead to challenges on scaling the motif size. In contrast to F 1 , F 2 and F 3 measures impose restrictions on the motif embeddings. Specifically, F 2 does not allow resulting embeddings of given motifs in the network sharing the same edge (i.e., interaction). F 3 restricts them from sharing the same node (i.e., molecule). Furthermore, F 2 and F 3 measures are downward closed [11] .\nThese distinct counting concepts provide various perspectives and trade-offs for the motif identification problem. For the F 2 measure, the authors in [28] uses the idea of dynamic expansion trees to count motif embeddings. They also propose a new algorithm using basic building patterns to find embeddings, and then iteratively join the parent patterns with these basic building patterns, which they called pattern-join [29] . In the work [11] , the authors introduced a motif-centric approach which constructs a set of basic building patterns and then explores embeddings corresponding to these patterns in term of F 2 , and F 3 . Then, in the work [30] , the authors consider F 3 for the motif identification problem in multi-layer networks. However, other than the topological constraints of F 2 and F 3 , existing methods for the motif identification problem do not consider biological constraints within networks, such as the regulatory relations. These are additional constraints that go beyond the motif topology and enforce the type of interactions (such as activation or suppression) for each interaction in the motif. Due to the bottleneck on the current computational capacity, handling the motif identifications with multiple constraints is challenging. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a more powerful computing scheme to broaden the scope of this problem.\nThe field of quantum computing has drawn significant attention and investment recently because of its potential supremacy over classical computational methods [18] . Specifically, quantum computing can address a variety of tasks which are intractable for classical computers [35, 13, 1, 6] ."}

With the rapid development of science and technology, conversational AI has been a long-standing area of exploration in the research community [1, 2, 3] and has now penetrated in both academia and industries with products such as Microsoft Cortana and Amazon Alexa. Recently, researchers work on integrating cooking tasks into conversation systems with the target to assist customers to complete everyday tasks [4] . To assist users with cooking tasks, fine-grained information about each recipe, such as cooking processes, utensils, nutritional profile, dietary style, and ingredient details, are needed. In particular, the ingredients details of a recipe typically contain attributes such as quantity, temperature, and processing state. Moreover, ingredient information itself can have use cases such as food pairing, flavour prediction, nutritional estimation, cost estimation and cuisine prediction. In Figure 1 , we show an example of a conversation where the intelligent agent is assisting a user to cook. Here we can see that the quantity and other information about the recipe are necessary to respond to users' requests.\nAlthough there are several datasets for the cooking domain, such as Recipe-1M+ [5] and RecipeNLG [6] , and a plethora of websites, such as AllRecipes and WikiHow, providing plenty of human-readable recipes, there is a lack of structured data about recipes useful to enable complex queries. Specifically, Fig. 1 : Applications of our ingredient parser model for conversational systems: The user may ask for details of ingredients (left side). The agent will then retrieve relevant recipes or cooking information from the pre-built database based on the dialogue states and contexts (right side).\nexisting ingredient information and their corresponding attributes are in an unstructured form with huge variations, for example, \"1 garlic clove, crushed\", and \"1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened\", making it difficult to extract precise attribute information. As shown on the right side of Figure 1 , the available ingredient information that we can extract from existing databases is all in the unstructured form."}

I was dropping off a check from my accounting job and I was in line behind a big guy who I'd struck up a conversation about the wildly fluctuating weather with. I'd just mentioned the crazy wind and how things had taken a turn for the worse when a couple people in balaclavas and big winter coats came in. \"See, case in point. In a couple days, they'll be putting those away and wearing t-shirts again.\" \n\nIn terms of last words before the shit hit the fan, those are pretty stupid-sounding. \n\nThe guns came out then, shiny metal with murderous intent. Suddenly I felt naked and afraid. Right after that, I realized I probably wasn't going to get to the library for a while. My mind handles crises in strange ways, apparently. \n\nThey overpowered the old portly security guard in moments as I stood and watched in shock. Unfortunately, the guard seemed to be years past the time when he was in good enough condition to provide security. So that left the rest of us. The big guy I was talking to had ducked behind a desk. The drive through teller still didn't know what was going on but the other tellers had dropped down below their desks and the other customers were shrinking away from the sudden outbreak of violence. \n\nDamn. That made me the closest person to them, and probably the next one they would approach. Fortunately for me, ever since elementary school, I had a way of dealing with people who seemed likely to hurt me. I stared at up into one corner of the ceiling and nudged my awareness into my nose, willing the blood vessels to open. I felt the pressure build in my nose and then release. \n\nI cringed, collapsed to the ground, holding my head in both hands. \"Damn tumor,\" I stage-grumbled. \"Sorry, give me a minute,\" I said, taking one hand off my head and holding the palm towards them, fingers up. The other hand slid around from the side of my head to my forehead. I appeared to struggle through a spike of pain before regaining composure, and I felt the warm damp stickiness of blood tracing down my lip, the coppery taste as it ran into my mouth. \"Right. I guess I'm...\" I winced again. \"I'll talk. I don't have all that long to live anyway.\" \n\nThe bank robbers, because that's what my brain realized they were, seemed to soften slightly. \"Hey, no worries, man, we just want the money. Don't get me wrong, we will totally kill anybody that tries anything, but we don't wan na have to kill anybody,\" one of them said. \n\n\"Thanks,\" I said weakly. \"Just take the money and don't shoot anybody.\" I hoped that had given the top bank person enough time to get the police involved and get done. \n\nAfter a few minutes of the robbers moving things around, I saw the police cars with the lights on coming up the street. I waved the rest of the people in the building to get out. They bolted and I stayed. It wouldn't have been consistent with the character I'd developed."}

{"text": "In order to create safe and efficient mobile robots, introspective and reliability-aware capabilities are required to assess and recover from perception failures. Many perception tasks, including localization [1] , scene understanding and sensor calibration [2] , rely on point cloud registration. However, registration may provide incorrect estimates due to local minima of the registration cost function [3] , uncompensated motion distortion [4] , noise or when the registration problem is geometrically under-constrained [5] , [6] . Consequently, it is essential to measure alignment quality and to reject or re-estimate alignment when quality is low. In the past, an extensive number of methods have been proposed to assess the alignment quality of point cloud pairs [7] - [17] . These metrics can typically be used to measure a relative alignment error in the process of registration, but provide limited information on whether the point clouds are correctly aligned once registration has been carried out [18] . Until today, few studies have targeted the measurement of alignment correctness after registration [18] , [19] and previous works report that alignment correctness classification based on AdaBoost and NDT score function decrease when applied to point clouds acquired from new environments [19] .\nIn this paper, we propose \"CorAl\" (Correctly Aligned?): A method to introspectively measure and detect misalignment between previously registered point cloud pairs. CorAl specifically aims to bridge the gap in classification performance when applied to new unseen environments.\nOur method is well grounded in information theory and gives an intuitive alignment correctness measure. CorAl measures the difference between the average differential entropy in the joint and separate point clouds. For well-aligned point clouds, the joint and the separate point clouds have similar entropy. In contrast, misaligned point clouds tend to \"blur\" the scene which can be measured as an increase in joint entropy as depicted in fig. 3 . By using the separate point clouds to estimate the entropy inherent in the scene, our proposed method can assess quality in a range of different environments. The contribution of this paper is an intuitive and simple measure of alignment correctness between point cloud pairs. We demonstrate how to use this quality measure to train a simple model that detects small alignment errors between point clouds, large errors are not considered in this paper."}

El vicepresidente de Anfac (Asociación Nacional de Fabricantes de Automóviles y Camiones), Mario Armero, calcula que este contexto \"provocará una detracción de las ventas de unos 45.000 vehículos con respecto a lo esperado\" inicialmente para 2019.\nArmero considera que no hay un contexto económico negativo que influya en la caída de las matriculaciones. Porque la actividad del país sigue mejorando -incluso lo hacen las revisiones de estimación de algunos organismos internacionales- y el paro baja. \"A pesar de ello hay gente que está retrasando la compra y, a la vez, tiene confusión sobre qué vehículo adquirir\", afirmó este viernes en la presentación de la Memoria Anual de la patronal. Son varios los factores que el vicepresidente de Anfac considera claves para entender este tipo de decisiones: las voces que han atacado a los vehículos de combustión, sobre todo los diésel; las medidas de restricción de algunos municipios, como Madrid, sin atender a un plan estatal; y la falta de ayudas públicas. De hecho, Anfac estima que el mercado cerrará este año con una caída del 3% en las ventas de coches. En 2018 se comercializaron 1.321.438 vehículos tras subir un 7%. \"Me gustaría que este pronóstico no se cumpliera\", ha afirmado Armero, quien considera que el descenso \"se puede moderar\" en la segunda parte del año si se pusiera en marcha alguna campaña de ayudas."}

{"text": "Animal diseases pose a risk to public health and cause damage to businesses and the economy at large. Among different reasons for livestock disease, livestock movements constitute major routes for the spread of infectious livestock disease [8] . For example, the long-range movement of sheep in combination with local transmission resulted in the FMD epidemic in the UK in 2001 [8, 14] . Livestock movements could, therefore, provide insight into the structure of the underlying transmission network and thus allow early detection and more effective management of infectious disease [11] . To do this, mathematical modelling has been employed widely to describe contact patterns of livestock movements and analyse their potential use for designing disease control strategies [11] . For the purpose of modelling disease spread among farm animals, it is common to consider a transmission network with farms as nodes and livestock movement between farms as edges.\nIn order to control or limit the spread of disease on this sort of transmission network, we focus our attention on edge deletion, which might correspond to forbidden trade partners or more reasonably, extra vaccinations or disease surveillance along certain trade routes. Introducing extra control of this kind is costly, so it is important to ensure that this is done as efficiently as possible. Many properties that might be desirable from the point of view of restricting the spread of disease can be expressed in terms of forbidden subgraphs: delete edges so that each connected component in the resulting graph has at most h vertices, is equivalent to edge-deletion to a graph avoiding all trees on h + 1 vertices. We are therefore interested in solving the following general problem: F -Free Edge Deletion Input: A graph G = (V, E), a set F of forbidden subgraphs and a positive integer k. Question: Does there exist E ′ ⊆ E(G) with |E ′ | = k such that G \\ E ′ does not contain any F ∈ F as a subgraph?\nA special case of particular interest is the situation in which F is the set T h+1 of all trees on h + 1 vertices, so that we delete edges in order to obtain a graph in which every component contains at most h vertices, so this special case is the problem T h+1 -Free Edge Deletion.\nT h+1 -Free Edge Deletion Input: A graph G = (V, E), and two positive integers k and h. Question: Does there exist E ′ ⊆ E(G) with |E ′ | = k such that each connected component in G \\ E ′ has at most h vertices, that is, the graph G \\ E ′ does not contain any tree on h + 1 vertices as a subgraph?"}

Therefore if a driver is doing something else the car will immediately alert the driver to take action to avoid any problems or damage. The text states \"They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.\" This textual evidence supports the point that these cars can alert drivers of hazardous or required human skills. Then they can also do all the work only need help when in need.\r\n\r\nThe smart car can do all the average driving, but will request assistance when handed complicated traffic problems. Smart cars can do drive by themself most of the time and they can alert the driver to get aid.

{"text": "Periodic behaviors emerge quite often in the dynamical analysis of systems. Their importance is even greater when dealing with complex and realistic models portraying natural phenomena, such as, e.g., the evolution of epidemics or population dynamics. Some form of delay is usually intrinsic in their description, and this is definitely the case we are focused in.\nWhile the subject of periodic solutions is well settled for ordinary differential equations as far as computation, continuation and bifurcation are considered (see, e.g., the package MatCont [2] as a representative of the state-of-the-art), relevant theory and computational tools have not yet reached a full maturity for delay equations. Among the main references for delay differential equations is DDE-Biftool [1, 22] , where the computation of periodic solutions is based on the work [20] , extending the classic piecewise orthogonal collation methods already used for the case of ordinary differential equations (see, e.g., [4, 5] ). But when it comes to dealing with more complicated systems, involving also renewal or Volterra integral and integro-differential equations, the lack is evident [12, 13] .\nThe present work was originally guided by the need to fill this gap, trying to extend the numerical collocation [20] to Renewal Equations (REs). Besides the basic aspects concerning implementation and computation, effort was initially devoted to providing sources from the literature for the analysis of the error and the relevant convergence. In realizing that even these sources are lacking or at least not general (see Section 1.2 below), we decided to tackle a full investigation starting from the basic case of Retarded Functional Differential Equations (RFDEs), mainly inspired by the recent \"trilogy\" of papers [29, 30, 31] , which deals with the numerical solution of Boundary Value Problems (BVPs).\nThe outcome, to the best of the authors' knowledge, is the first rigorous and fullydetailed analysis of error and convergence of piecewise collocation methods for the computation of periodic solutions of general RFDEs. Let us anticipate that the proposed approach is based on collocating the derivative of the solution following [31] and in view of extension to REs as discussed in Section 2.2.\nIn this introduction we start in Section 1.1 by deriving two equivalent BVP formulations for general RFDEs in view of computing periodic solutions.

{"text": "韩国最近爆出涉及人数恐怕将会高达26万人的网路性犯罪事件「N号房」，连韩国总统文在寅也被惊动，于3月23日承诺将会交代警方撤查，并会对至少74人的受害者提供医疗和其他服务。\n「N号房」事件是一件利用网路即时通讯软件「Telegram」进行的性剥削犯罪。根据韩国媒体《韩民族日报》披露，嫌犯首先在2018年底以工作招募的名义在网路接触女性，设法骗取女性的个人资料及私密照片。又或是冒充公务人员，挑选有「清凉」自拍照片的女性，恐吓其涉及性犯罪，威胁受害女性拍下更多过激的裸照和影片，然后更进一步的威胁性虐待与性侵，甚至有女性被迫在身上用刀片划出污辱性文字。\n嫌犯接著在韩国流行的通讯软体建设加密聊天室「房间」，并在房间中传播这些影片与裸照，房间用数字编号，所以称为「N号房」，有各种不同的类型，例如老师、女警、空姐，许多房间都要登记成为付费会员才能进入观看影片，费用按比特币或是其他在线付费渠道付清。\n为了避免遭到警方或是记者的潜入，许多房间还会要求会员也必须要「贡献」出资源，而且必须是自己真实拍摄的，不能是网路上流传的或是商业拍摄的，否则就算已经缴费也会很快被踢出房间。于是有些人偷拍自己女友的裸体影片，有些人偷拍自己亲人的影片，有些人更转而去诱骗更多的网上女性，并且开设更多的房间，简直成为了一个犯罪者聚集地。\n如今仅是被韩国警方确认的受害女性就多达74人，未成年人也超过1/5。而被警方锁定涉案的人数更超过120人，但是在各个房间中付费成为会员的总数，却是惊人的26万余帐号，就算有许多帐号是同一个人在不同房间中登记，实际人数也可能超过上万人。\n令人害怕的规模 网路助长的性犯罪\n这显示在网路时代下，犯罪行为的影响力将会呈现等比级数的增长。过去，虽然打工骗色或是冒充公务身分的犯罪行为也并不少见，但从来没有这种影响达到超过万人规模的事情。这也是N号房在韩国社会乃至国际引起轩然大波的原因。\n而且，这种长期控制女性拍摄情色影片来谋利的行为，其实就是在胁迫卖淫，而不仅是性侵。事实上，亦真有嫌犯胁迫受害女性前往特定地点，和付费的「客人」进行性行为，然后再拍下影片甚至是直播的情况。当然，这类犯罪所得利润都进了嫌犯的口袋，被控制的受害女性只能不断被威胁拍下更多视频，被剥削的程度恐怕比许多贫穷国度的雏妓问题还更严重，毕竟经营雏妓还得提供吃住，N号房的受害者则平时仍然继续日常生活，直到嫌犯发来下一次的威胁要求。\n很多在网路上流传的非法未成年人色情影片，其实是在1990年代到2000年代早期流出，多数都来自东欧、南美、东南亚国家，很明显是因为当时各地普遍贫穷与法治不彰。但是，在韩国这样的富裕、拥有大量警力的国家，居然在超过一年的时间里对这样大规模的性剥削犯罪没有任何警觉，直到2020年的3月初才经过媒体披露，实在令人惊讶。\n再加上，由于网路的匿名性与距离感，很多嫌犯表现得比现实世界中的性罪犯更加残忍，胁迫受害女性拍下的影片更加过分，受害女性除了被迫自残的影片外，还有各种性虐待、在公众场所裸露全身等等的影片，对受害女性的伤害极大。\n通讯软件的私密性成双面刃"}

{"text": "Foundation models [13, 18] , trained on vast and diverse datasets, have shown impressive capabilities in various tasks [37, 39] and are revolutionizing artificial intelligence. The extraordinary zero-shot and few-shot generalization abilities of foundation models derive a wide range of downstream tasks and achieve numerous and remarkable progress. In contrast to the traditional methods of training task-specific models from scratch, the \"pre-training then finetuning\" paradigm has proven pivotal, particularly in the realm of computer vision. Segment Anything Model (SAM) [28] , pre-trained over 1 billion masks on 11 million natural images, has been recently proposed as a visual foundation model for promptdriven image segmentation and has gained significant attention. SAM can generate precise object binary masks based on its impressive zero-shot capabilities.\nAs a very important branch of image segmentation, medical image segmentation has been dominated by deep learning medical segmentation methods [1, 2, 41] for the past few years. The existing deep learning models are often tailored, which have a strong inductive bias and limit their capacity, for specific tasks. This raises an intriguing question: Can SAM still have the ability to revolutionize the field of medical image segmentation? Or can SAM still achieve high-performance results in medical image segmentation by properly fine-tuning based on SAM's strong zero-shot capabilities in natural image segmentation? To address the aforementioned inquiries, it is imperative to first tackle several intrinsic issues inherent in applying SAM directly to medical image segmentation. The primary concern lies in SAM's inability to predict semantic labels for the generated binary masks, as it exclusively predicts a singular binary mask per prompt without associating semantic labels. Usually, medical images involve multiple labels and each label carries semantic information. Additionally, the second challenge involves SAM which requires users to input precise prompts to segment target regions. The third issue is that SAM does not always perform well when applied directly to medical image segmentation tasks, even with the appropriate prompts. Therefore, the challenge lies in refining the fine-tuning process for SAM from natural image segmentation to medical image segmentation. This paper aims to investigate the methodology for adapting SAM from its original 2D natural image segmentation to 3D medical image segmentation.\nSince it is rigorous to expect all users to have the medical knowledge to provide points in target regions or frame out target regions only given raw images, the pivotal challenge becomes the design of a prompt-free architecture for SAM. Simultaneously, we observe that the image encoder employs the Vision Transformer (ViT) [14] pre-trained with masked auto-encoder [18] as the backbone."}
{"text": "Sixteen photos that capture the adrenaline-fuelled action of the GTA’s wild rodeos\nSixteen photos that capture the adrenaline-fuelled action of the GTA’s wild rodeos\nYou expect to find rodeos in rural parts of Canada, but just on the outskirts of the GTA there’s a pack of daredevil riders willing to risk their necks in the arena to prove their mettle. Toronto Life photographer Daniel Neuhaus spent a couple of weekends at the Grand Valley and Markham Fair Rodeo to capture the action. Here, he discusses some of his favourite shots.\nRiders are paired with broncs at the beginning of the day using names pulled from a hat. A rider never knows which horse he’ll get until the draw, which happens two hours before the rodeo. In this photo, 19-year-old Mason Duijsens, who is originally from Holland but now lives in Erin, Ontario, is competing. The goal is to stay on the horse for eight seconds with one hand while keeping your feet in the stirrups. Afterward, the judges reveal their scores based on the rider and horse’s performance. The winner receives money and sometimes a belt buckle. “He is a tough horse to ride and is getting better at his job at each rodeo,” says Duijsens. “He acts up in the chutes and has a couple smart moves. Unfortunately, I did not stay on him for eight seconds that weekend.”\nDuijsens learned to ride at a farm in his hometown. During practice one night, he overheard that they were going to be short on bronc riders at an upcoming rodeo. “I wanted to impress this girl, so decided to give it a go,” he says. “I got on my first bronc and I was hooked. I impressed the girl, but didn’t last much longer after that.”\nDuijsens says the most difficult part of competing is the mental aspect: “When you barely have enough money to pay your entry fees and food, miss your family at home, and on top, of that you’re still in pain from the previous rodeo, it’s hard. With all that on your mind, you have to be able to stay focused and maintain a positive attitude. Luckily, my rodeo family helps with that.”\nTwenty-three-year-old Shelby McGowan and her horse, Dee, are barrel racers. In this competition, the rider and horse attempt to navigate a set of three barrels set up in a cloverleaf formation. The fastest time wins, and seconds are deducted for running into the barrels. “Keeping your head where it needs to be, even when you and your horse don’t get done what you wanted, helps you pick yourself up and try again,” she says.\nSixteen-year-old Brad Vanuden, who lives in Nestleton, Ontario, rode a bull called Beach Bum. Here, Brad is pictured with the Roughtstock Crew just after making eight seconds at the Markham Rodeo. “We met at the rodeo. We do everything together, and I wouldn’t be able to do it without them.”\nHere are the Brazilian full-time professional rodeo riders. “In Brazil, the rodeo is one of the most popular sports,” says Warlen Velton. “What hockey is to Canadians, the rodeo is for us in the rural areas. Back home, riders are committed to a single rodeo for several days. But here in Ontario, I can ride in four different rodeos in four days,” he says.\nNineteen-year old Andrew Deschamps is a bullfighter hoping to make a career of rodeo. The bullfighter uses himself as bait to distract the bulls from fallen riders so they aren’t trampled. “My job is to protect the bull rider at all times and no matter what,” he says. “Last year, there was a cow with only one horn in the junior bull riding, and she was a bit mean. When the rider came off, she went straight at me, and I was like, ‘no problem, it’s just a cow, and she’s only got one horn.’ But then she threw me up in the air, and just embarrassed me.”\nHere, 18-year-old Ally Mackey rides her horse Hannah Brown. “The craziest thing that’s happened to me during a rodeo was when Riker, one of my horses, reared up before going in the chute for our run and the buttons on my shirt got caught on the horn of my saddle… I didn’t realize, until I got passed my first barrel, that my shirt was half-open and flapping away, so for a good part of my run I was just trying to keep my shirt on.”\nThe strap you see coming off the back of the bull is a flank strap, which is made from soft cotton. The strap encourages the bull to use its hind legs and buck the rider. Contrary to popular belief, it does not hurt the animal. Rodeo bulls are essentially treated like athletes, receiving high levels of care and attention.\nThe two cowboys in the background are the “pick-up men.” They work in teams of two, and their job is to assist the bronc rider after he’s made it to eight seconds by pulling him off the bronc and onto his own horse."}
{"text": "Computers are one of the best inventions ever made by humans because they have enabled everybody around the world to connect to the Internet. The Internet fuels most peoples lives because of the sheer amount of accessible information about anything and everything. However, should we let computers start making their own decisions? Thomas Huang is the creator of a computer software that allows computesr to read human emotions using 3-D modeling and analyzing muscle movements in the face. At first glance, this appears to be an interesting concept, but there could be several downsides to this type of invention such as overall practicality, implementation in today's society, and even safety and security issues.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, is a software that can read our emotions actually useful? There is potential for this type of software to be used on people for occasions such as a interrogation where the suspect could be lying and the software could detect a quivering lip. On the other hand, this type of software is most likely not going to make it into the homes of the people which presents a business problem. Their solution is to introduce the software into schools to be used for enhancing the learning experience. Dr Huang describes how computers in the classroom could \"recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor\" resulting in a better learning environment for the student. The issue is, not every student needs this, and many will prbably disagree with having this software implemented in their school. So, this type of computer software has few areas that it will probably be used causing it to be less practical than it originally seems.\r\n\r\nSecondly, how will FACS (Facial Action Coding System) be implemented into a society that is normally unwilling to new changes regarding their technology? People want improvements, but they don't want change. For example, when an application has an update most people update it without giving it a second thought because the newer it is the more likely it will be \"better\" than the previous version. But, when a new phone comes out with plenty of changes people are skeptical and wait for their friend to buy it before they consider purchasing one themselves. So, as a result, people will most likely be skeptical of a software that is able to read emotions because it is something new and no one has any experiences with it yet."}

Porque nos hemos dado cuenta y mucha gente me lo dicen por la calle, que hemos recuperado la ilusión del PP de Pontevedra. La gente está ilusionada con el proyecto. Cada día más.\n- ¿Cómo valora que Lores haya vuelto a ganar?\n- Tiene su mérito, desde luego. No le vamos a quitar el mérito a un alcalde que llevan tantos años y que con toda probabilidad va a seguir cuatro años más. Los pontevedreses han decidido eso, nosotros le felicitamos y ahora a trabajar. Sí hay que analizar en este contexto que estamos en un final de ciclo. Empieza a haber una caída del BNG y una subida del PP, e incluso empiezan a irse figuras históricas del nacionalismo, como Bará, Legísima, Anxos Riveiro..., gente muy potente del nacionalismo que se ha ido y además ese lugar no está siendo ocupado por otros.\n- Feijóo ha tendido la mano al PSOE en Ourense para un pacto ¿Es posible en Pontevedra?\n- En este momento no lo contemplo. El PSOE ya ha dicho que no votaría nunca a favor de la investidura de un alcalde del PP, y aunque es cierto que la aritmética daría, creo que ellos llevan ya mucho tiempo jugando a ser muleta del BNG y están intentando volver a conseguirlo.\n- ¿En ningún momento se llegó a barajar esa posibilidad?\n- No.\n- ¿Y que prefiere, un bipartito BNG-PSOE o un gobierno del Bloque en solitario?\n- Eso me da igual."}

{"text": "In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved empirical success on processing data from various fields such as social networks, quantum chemistry, particle physics, knowledge graphs and combinatorial optimization [4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 31, 47, 55, 58, 66, 68, 69, 70, 71, 73, 74] . Thanks to such progress, there have been growing interests in studying the expressive power of GNNs. One line of work does so by studying their ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs. In this regard, Xu et al. [64] and Morris et al. [44] show that GNNs based on neighborhood-aggregation schemes are at most as powerful as the classical Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test [60] and propose GNN architectures that can achieve such level of power. While graph isomorphism testing is very interesting from a theoretical viewpoint, one may naturally wonder how relevant it is to real-world tasks on graph-structured data. Moreover, WL is powerful enough to distinguish almost all pairs of non-isomorphic graphs except for rare counterexamples [3] . Hence, from the viewpoint of graph isomorphism testing, existing GNNs are in some sense already not far from being maximally powerful, which could make the pursuit of more powerful GNNs appear unnecessary.\n1. We prove that neither MPNNs [18] nor 2nd-order Invariant Graph Networks (2-IGNs) [41] can count induced subgraphs for any connected pattern of 3 or more nodes. For any such pattern, we prove this by constructing a pair of graphs that provably cannot be distinguished by any MPNN or 2-IGN but with different induced-subgraph-counts of the given pattern. This result points at an important class of simple-looking tasks that are provably hard for classical GNN architectures.\n2. We prove that MPNNs and 2-IGNs can count subgraphs for star-shaped patterns, thus generalizing the results in Arvind et al. [2] to incorporate node and edge features. We also show that k-WL and k-IGNs can count subgraphs and induced subgraphs for patterns of size k, which provides an intuitive understanding of the hierarchy of k-WL's in terms of increasing power in counting substructures.\n3. We prove that T iterations of k-WL is unable to count induced subgraphs for path patterns of (k + 1)2 T or more nodes. The result is relevant since real-life GNNs are often shallow, and also demonstrates an interplay between k and depth.\n4. Since substructures present themselves in local neighborhoods, we propose a novel GNN architecture called Local Relation Pooling (LRP) 1 , with inspirations from Murphy et al. [45] . We empirically demonstrate that it can count both subgraphs and induced subgraphs on random synthetic graphs while also achieving competitive performances on molecular datasets."}

{"text": "Smart infrastructure projects, e.g., building automation, are increasingly dependent on BIM and BMS for metadata and data collection, analysis and activation components. BMS' often have the ability to monitor lighting, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) as well as electricity consumption. Typically proprietary software, most BMS vendors provide closed system products with industrial interfaces for activation, control, and basic data visualisation without the additional contextual data from BIM. Simultaneously, considerable effort is being expended on the deployment of IoT devices to increase sensor density, but unfortunately the industry remains highly fragmented [10, 30] .\nAdditionally, legacy BMS' and much current research focuses on in-building sensor data collection, storage and presentation platforms, rarely emphasising the challenges and benefits of being able to analyse and respond to data in real-time [16, 18, 45] . BMS' have historically dealt with low-volume low-velocity data and metadata, so the adoption of IoT devices poses substantial network and system challenges in dealing with real-time data analysis, event recognition, prediction and action planning [40] .\nIn this paper we focus on the real-time aspects of spatio-temporal data available from IoT sensing. We define a real-time platform as an asynchronous system capable of processing high-volume, highheterogeneity data with minimal latency to collect, analyse, predict and adapt to changes in a timely manner.\nA real-time data architecture is only part of the puzzle though: despite the increasing deployment of IoT devices, there are still no canonical means to join BIM and deployed sensors in a single unified system. While numerous attempts exist in the form of creating ontologies (e.g., BRICK) [8, 9] to unify static metadata management for use by building automation systems, industry recognition for metadata standards is limited [10, 11, 30] . Also, as a result augmenting BIM with IoT devices, building and facility management software must be adapted [28] . Highly siloed BMS software must become able to handle an increased amount of contextual building data in a timely manner to comply with the use of edge computing to for accident and emergency management [33] and smart home initiatives resulting in the creation of safer and more resilient smart spaces [23, 46] . New approaches that combine BIM, BMS and sensor data are thus needed.\nTo meet these important challenges, we propose the Adaptive City Platform (ACP), a system for collecting, processing and visualising building information and sensor data in real-time."}

{"text": "The connection between sellers and buyers is at the core of online marketplaces such as eBay or Amazon [14] . These large e-commerce marketplaces see millions of daily transactions, and therefore some conflicts inevitably occur, from an unreceived package to a product being different than expected. Many disputes are resolved by direct communication between buyer and seller, yet not always an agreement can be reached. In such cases, the dispute has to be resolved by the marketplace platform, typically by applying a human arbitrator to examine and resolve cases. This kind of decision making is essential for an online marketplace to take care of the interests of both sides and establish user trust. Yet, as the number of transactions grows, manual arbitrator work becomes a burden.\nAutomating the arbitration process is of great importance, and it is common practice to use simple automated rules such as \"if tracking information shows that the item has not arrived, and the seller does not respond, the buyer wins the case\". As arbitrators follow very specific guidelines in their arbitration workflow, it would seem that an automatic rule-based system would be sufficient.\nHowever, many cases require a broader outlook, which is hard to capture with a rule-based system. Misunderstandings or missing information can be resolved by examining buyer and seller data and the correspondence between them. For example, in cases where there is a fraud concern, an arbitrator will want to inspect the history of both the buyer and the seller for previous suspicious behavior. In addition, arbitration requires understanding natural language used by both sides to fully comprehend their claims. Textual messages are especially useful to fill gaps in other signals, like wrong shipping or tracking information.\nWe propose to aid human arbitrators in their decision making with a model predicting the final resolution of the dispute. We gathered a large dispute dataset consisting of claim features, transaction features, seller features, buyer features, and textual communication features. Seller and buyer features include past behavior on the site, demographic features, general priors, and priors related to the transaction in dispute. By using this data to predict outcome, we hope to give human arbitrators a first approximation of the final result. This could help save manpower and cope with the fast-growing amount of transactions (and consequently, disagreements).\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of dispute analysis and automatic resolution in e-commerce. Our contributions in this paper are:\n• We collect and analyze a dataset of disputes between buyers and sellers in an e-commerce platform. We explore the dataset, reporting interesting correlations and properties that we discovered through the exploration (Section 5). • We train models for predicting dispute outcome (Section 6). We develop a classifier that reaches AUC of 0.94 with precision of 89% and recall of 88%. • We describe the model results and perform ablation studies to assess the importance of features and feature families, and find that integrating various aspects of the data is crucial for performance, as no single feature family suffices for accurate classification."}

Alors que, sans comptabilisation de la redevance, le taux d’indépendance énergétique se limiterait à 43% contre 38% en 2020.\nHausse de 33% des ressources d’ énergie primaire\nLes ressources en énergie primaire se sont situées à 3.8 Mtep à fin septembre 2021, enregistrant une hausse par rapport à la même période de l’année précédente de 33%.\nCette hausse est expliquée par l’augmentation de la production nationale du pétrole, du gaz et aussi de la redevance du passage du gaz algérien qui a enregistré une hausse de 135% durant les neuf premiers mois de 2021 par rapport à la même période de l’année précédente.\nLes ressources en énergie primaire restent dominées par la production nationale de pétrole et de gaz qui participent tous les deux à hauteur de 77% de la totalité des ressources d’énergie primaire. La part de la redevance du gaz algérien a presque doublé en l’espace d’un an. Sa part est passée de 10% à 18%. La part de l’électricité renouvelable (production STEG uniquement) reste timide et ne représente que 1% des ressources primaires.\nAugmentation de 7% de la demande en énergie primaire\nLa demande en énergie primaire a augmenté de 7%, passant de 6.8 Mtep, à fin septembre 2021, à 7.3 Mtep, au cours de la même période de l’année 2020.\nLa demande de gaz naturel a augmenté de 4% et celle des produits pétroliers de 9%. Rappelons qu’en mai 2020, le pays a débuté la première phase de déconfinement progressif. La structure de la demande en énergie primaire a enregistré un léger changement."}

They had held each other and beamed as Rupert was transferred by the doctor into the genetic coding chamber. \n\n\"Are you ready to program your son?\" Asked the doctor with a smile. \n\nColin and Felicity looked at each other nodding. \"Yes,\" said Felicity, grasping Colin's hand. \"Yes we are.\" \n\nRupert was placed in the gene manipulation chamber. The machine had put an end to genetic disease overnight, as it allowed the traits of newborns to be selected by the parents. However, while dangerous genomes would automatically be modified,'luxury alterations' (as they were known) were effected by means of chance. \n\nExcessive populational perfection was deemed dangerous and undesirable by various governing bodies. So, parents would roll dice to determine how their child would develop. \n\n\"OK,\" said the doctor. The contraption looked like a vending machine, and he motioned to a hole that looked like something for dispensing change. \"Collect the dice from here,\" he said, \"and drop them in the hole up here. The machine will reveal the number of the roll, and that score will then represent the ability of your child in that particular area. Once you have the score, press next here and the dice will drop again.\" The doctor puffed out his cheeks and laughed. \"Any questions?\" \n\n\"No,\" said Colin, looking at Felicity. \"I think we've got it, thanks.\" \n\n\"Then over to you,\" he chirped. \n\nAlone in the room with his wife and child, Colin walked over to the machine, pressing his palm against the glass. Rupert looked perfect already. Felicity watched on from the bed. \n\n\"What is the first trait?\" She asked excitedly. \n\n\"Beauty,\" said Colin. He took the dice from the tray. \"Ready?\" He asked, looking back at Felicity. \n\n\"Yes, do it.\" She made a high pitched whine of excitement. \n\nColin dropped the dice into the slot, heard some clicking, followed by a small rattle, and then a gulp. A digital display behind Rupert read'6'. \n\n\"Yeah!\" Shouted Colin. \"Six out of six! Our kid is going to be a looker!\" \n\nBoth parents celebrated and wooped, they high-fived and hugged, and after a minute or two, having pressed'next', Colin was again collecting the dice. \n\nHe turned around with a look of seriousness. Fiona looked suddenly concerned. \n\n\"Is there a problem?\" She asked. \n\n\"This next one is intelligence,\" said Colin soberly. \n\nFelicity gasped. \"Make sure you roll it well,\" she warned, and put her hands together and began to pray. \n\nColin nodded, and turned back to the machine. He exhaled deeply. He dropped the dice in the hole - click, rattle, gulp - and the machine read'3'. \n\n\"What is it?\" Cried Felicity. \n\n\"Three,\" said Colin. For a moment there was silence. \n\nFelicity looked up with concentration. \"You know, three isn't too bad, Colin?\" \n\nColin pondered the score. \"No, I suppose not.\" \n\n\"After all,\" said Felicity, \"Jerry's boy rolled low for intelligence! Margaret told me so\" \n\n\"Jerry's boy?\" Said Colin incredulously. \"Well he seems perfectly bright to me...\" \n\n\"Well exactly,\" said Felicity. \"And our Rupert has a three! That's not even low! It's middle of the road!\" \n\n\"Middle of the road...\" Parroted Colin with wonder. He suddenly felt quite pleased with himself and pressed'next' with renewed optimism."}
{"text": "The Chargers’ 48-17 thumping at the hands of the Seattle Seahawks in Sunday night’s preseason opener was compounded by a potentially significant injury to a key starter.\nMiddle linebacker Denzel Perryman hurt his left ankle in the first quarter and returned to the sidelines on crutches and in a walking boot. Perryman had an MRI test Monday. The team did not issue a medical update.\n“I’m not sure how bad it is right now, we’ll have to wait and see,” coach Anthony Lynn said after the game. “It could be serious, but I have no idea right now.”\nThe team already lost projected starting right guard Forrest Lamp for the season when the second-round pick out of Western Kentucky tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in the first week of training camp.\nFirst-round pick Mike Williams, the former Clemson wide receiver, will sit out training camp while recovering from a herniated disk in his lower back, an injury he suffered in May. There is no timetable for his return.\nPerryman, 24, a second-round pick out of Miami in 2015, had 80 tackles, two sacks and one interception in 12 games, 11 of them starts, last season. He sat out four games because of hamstring and knee injuries. He had 95 tackles and two sacks in 14 games as a rookie in 2015.\nPerryman’s injury likely will push reserve middle linebacker Korey Toomer into the starting lineup. Toomer, who had four tackles Sunday night, appeared in 13 games, with eight starts, last season, recording 69 tackles and one sack.\nMr. Clean\nThe most impressive part about a game-opening, 13-play, 75-yard scoring drive in which Philip Rivers completed five of six passes for 56 yards Sunday was that the quarterback left the field after the 7-minute 15-second possession without one grass stain on his uniform.\nJae C. Hong / Associated Press Photo Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers grabs a snap during the first half against the Seattle Seahawks on Aug. 13. Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers grabs a snap during the first half against the Seattle Seahawks on Aug. 13. (Jae C. Hong / Associated Press Photo)\n“We kept Philip clean,” left guard Matt Slauson said. “He was getting the ball out fast. We ran the ball well. Everything was rolling. Communication was fast and clean. Nobody was really unsure.”\nThe play of a revamped line, which will feature at least three new starters, will be a key to the Chargers offense, which is strong at the skilled positions with Rivers, running back Melvin Gordon and a fleet of talented receivers and tight ends.\nThe first-team line shined, giving Rivers time to carve up Seattle’s first-string defense. Included on the drive was a short pass on a crossing route to tight end Hunter Henry for 17 yards and Travis Benjamin’s 15-yard catch between two defenders on a third-and-nine play.\nA screen pass to Branden Oliver for 14 yards gave the Chargers a first and goal at the eight, and veteran tight end Antonio Gates boxed out a Seattle defender while catching his five-yard scoring pass.\n“When you have a guy like Philip, a guy who understands the system, understands the game, he puts you in the best position possible,” Gates said. “That’s what he was able to do. We were so efficient. Our whole thing is trying to be balanced, and we were able to do that.”\nReserve clause\nThe first-team defense kept Seattle out of the end zone on Seattle’s first two possessions, with cornerback Casey Hayward providing tight coverage on Tanner McEvoy on the first drive and end Melvin Ingram stopping quarterback Trevone Boykin for no gain on the second drive.\nBut the second- and third-team defenders, as well as the offensive reserves, were badly outplayed by Seattle’s subs.\n“We’re going to be a good team, but it’s not just about the ones,” safety Tre Boston said. “Unfortunately in football, your ones will go down every so often, and we need twos and threes who are going to pick up the slack and help us.”\nMixed bag"}
{"text": "I support the developement of driverless/autonomous cars. Cars have been driven by human drivers so far and accidents are frequent and often violent. If we had autonomous cars, we could almost completely eliminate human error altogether. Autonomous cars would also be more efficient.\r\n\r\nDriverless cars would replace they human driver, who can be sometimes angered by other drivers, distracted by passengers, or get easily lost in new places, with a more logic minded computer. An autonomous car would be safer than a human driven car because a computer program cannot be distracted by its passengers or get angry at someone's poor driving because a computer doesn't think emotionally, but rather logically, making the computer driver safer. Google has been test driving partial-autonomous cars in certain conditions for 7 years and has so far had no crashes.\r\n\r\nAutonomous cars would not only be a safer alternative to human driving, but a more fuel eficient, and therefore, greener alternative. According to Google cofounder Sergey Brin, autonomous cars would be twice as fuel efficient as today's taxis and buses. With more fuel efficient cars, pollution due to carbon dioxide emmisions will drastically decrease. Fuel efficient cars also help the American economy because if cars are using half as much gasoline, then we only have to import half as much oil, which will save us money as a country."}

{"text": "Scaling the cyber hunt problem poses several key technical challenges. Detecting and characterizing cyber threats at scale in large enterprise networks is hard because of the vast quantity and complexity of the data that must be analyzed as adversaries deploy varied and evolving tactics to accomplish their goals. There is a great need to automate all aspects, and, indeed, the workflow of cyber hunting. AI offers many ways to support this. We have developed the WILEE system that automates cyber threat hunting by translating highlevel threat descriptions into many possible concrete implementations. Both the (high-level) abstract and (lowlevel) concrete implementations are represented using a custom domain specific language (DSL). WILEE uses the implementations along with other logic, also written in the DSL, to automatically generate queries to confirm (or refute) any hypotheses tied to the potential adversarial workflows represented at various layers of abstraction. We summarize WILEE in Section 2.\nIn this contribution we focus on presenting two AI components of WILEE that coordinate to support its automated query generation for hunting, see Figure 1 . First, in Section 3, we introduce a hunt component, named Malmo, that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate extraction and translation of known threat descriptions. Known threats can be identified with pattern recognition and signature-based methods. Their descriptions are embedded within humanreadable, semi-structured documents. Malmo extracts and translates, to machine digestible format, key fields of the documents including indicators of compromise, to make them operational for the hunt.\nKnown threats evolve into unknown threats."}

{"text": "My mother had insisted I never enter the drawing room and the way my father looked at me over the top of his glasses, well he didn't need to say anything at all. I had always followed their rules, they had never given me reason not to and I had my old brother as an example of what happens if I wouldn't. John hadn't been home in years. \n\nBut they were out that afternoon and the house was mine. It was warm lazy Sunday, the windows open to let in a soft breeze. The neighborhood was quiet as my friends were at sailing or tennis camps. Maybe it was the book I had just finished, as it was a mystery novel of young girl who finds a secret cave in the woods and solve an accident murder. Maybe it gave me a few ideas. Maybe I missed my brother and the antics he used to create. Maybe I was bored. Whatever it was, I found myself facing the closed oak door. I loved the way it looked and the way the heavy door knob fit into my hand - cold despite the warm day. I turned the knob and it opened softly. \n\nThe brightness of the room was almost blinding. A soft lace curtain fluttered in breeze of the open bay window. An ornate wooden desk faced outside with a matching chair. Pens and stationary filled the desk but not in a cluttered way; it was very organized as if it was on display. A dress pattern hung on a sewing mannequin and it was very lovely, although dated. Unusual considering my mother didn't sew. I giggled, thinking about the possibility it could belong to my father. Considering it was just the three of us living here, I didn't understand who used this room or why. Framed calligraphy hung on the walls - so perfectly done I assumed it was a print. I would later learn it was her handwriting and had taken her months to complete each one. \n\nI was admiring the plush white carpeting, so different from the rest of the house, when I saw the bureau. Despite having broken so many rules already, I hesitated to open it. But, having admired everything else in the room, I figured a punishment couldn't get much worse for doing so. I turned the delegate knob and it clicked open. A smell I could not place, but knew and loved, hit me. Old coats and dresses hung inside, hat boxes lined the top shelve and small tiny drawers held jewelry and white elbow length gloves so stiff I couldn't get them on. The smell would come and go, I would catch it as I opened each drawer or brushed against the hanging coats. I buried my face into the heaviest coat there was, trying to breath more and more of it in. And that's how my mother found me, wrapped in a fur coat, eyes closed, wondering why on earth they would ever keep such a perfect room from me. \n\n\"All of this belong to your grandmother. We redid the house when she died, everything but this room. This is exactly how she left it\" my mother explained, sitting down on the floor next to me. \"You loved her so much as a baby - she'd babysit you while your father was overseas and I was at work. You'd cry every night I came to pick you up, and run into her arms every morning I dropped you off. At the time, I felt jealous. When your father returned and I stopped working, I told her I wouldn't be needing her help raising my children. I threw away her cards for you, I wouldn't let her visit you kids for months.\" I saw my mothers' eyes fill up with tears of regret as she told me this."}

{"text": "he internet has evolved into a crucial aspect of modern life, with billions of users worldwide and the ability to support various services and apps. Approximately 5.25 billion people have access to and utilize the internet globally as of 2023, making up 66.2% of the expected 7.9 billion people on the planet [1] . The use of data centers to support Internet applications is growing rapidly, with experts predicting increased reliance on data centers fueled by Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven workloads, new cloud services, demand for edge applications, expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and the proliferation of technologies such as 5G/6G.\nThe rise of AI workloads in data centers has been a significant trend in recent years. AI workloads require immense computing power, especially for training complex deep learning models. They also necessitate vast amounts of data for training and improving models, leading to increased data transfer and storage needs. As a result, AI-driven computing is fueling demand for more power-hungry data centers with expanded storage capabilities [2] . In addition to storage and computing power, the widespread use of AI workloads has led to a growing need for real-time processing and decisionmaking. These workloads have gained prominence in data centers due to several factors, including the growth in smart edge computing (e.g., with increasingly autonomous vehicles) and the proliferation of IoT applications (e.g., those used in smart home devices) [3] .\nCloud service providers are investing significantly in extending their data center infrastructure to accommodate the rising demand for cloud services and AI inference workloads. In particular, there has been a shift towards building and adding data centers across multiple geographic locations [9], [10] . There are several reasons to favor geographically distributed data centers as they provide advantages in load balancing, reliability and redundancy, latency reduction, and compliance with data sovereignty rules [11] . Another compelling reason for geographically spreading data centers is to reduce electricity costs by taking advantage of Time-Of-Use (TOU) electricity pricing. According to the TOU electricity pricing model [12] , electricity prices fluctuate depending on the time of day. When demand for the entire electrical grid is high, electricity costs rise; whereas when the demand is low, they decline [13] . Utilities also impose an additional flat-rate (peak demand) cost on non-residential or commercial customers depending on the maximum (peak) power utilized at any given moment within a monthly billing period [14] . These peak demand fees sometimes exceed the amount of the electricity bill devoted to energy use. One efficient way to lower electricity costs is to move workloads between geo-distributed data centers. With the help of this strategy, cloud service providers can distribute workloads to data centers with lower energy prices. This can reduce the cost of cloud computing for clients and operating costs for cloud service providers.\nToday, major cloud service providers run multiple massive power-hungry data centers around multiple geographic locations. These data centers consume about 3% of global electricity and contribute approximately 2% of all Green-House Gas emissions (GHG) emissions worldwide [15] . During the COVID pandemic, increased reliance on web and cloud services drastically increased internet traffic and data center utilization."}

{"text": "Many inverse problems in imaging sciences consider the estimation of an unknown image x ∈ R d from an observation y, related to x as follows\nEQUATION\nwhere A is an observation operator and n is additive noise. Equation ( 1) is commonly referred to as the forward model. Recovering x from the observation y by inverting the observation model is usually an ill-posed or ill-conditioned problem, in the sense that the the solution is not unique, or it is not stable w.r.t. perturbations of the observation y. To reduce estimation uncertainty and provide meaningful solutions it is necessary to use additional information about the unknown image x so that the estimation problem becomes well-posed 1 .\nThe Bayesian statistical framework provides a powerful framework to formulate well-posed solutions to such imaging inverse problems. In this framework, the likelihood of the observation y given the unknown x is described by a statistical model with probability density function p(y|x), and assumptions on the unknown x take the form of a marginal or prior density p(x). These densities are usually specified explicitly, either directly or via their potentials U (x) = -log p(x) and F (x, y) = -log p(y|x). Observed and prior information are then combined by using Bayes' theorem to derive the posterior distribution of x given y, with probability density function given by p(x|y) = p(y|x)p(x) p(y|x)p(x)dx .\n(\nThis model underpins our inferences about x|y and provides the basis for deriving Bayesian estimates. While different Bayesian estimators can then be considered, the Bayesian imaging literature predominantly relies on the maximum-a-posteriori \nwhich is usually computationally cheaper than other estimators that require computing expectations w.r.t x|y, such as the the Minimum Mean Square Error estimator (MMSE) xmmse = E[x|y] = R d xp(x|y)dx. Until recently, most approaches in Bayesian imaging relied on explicit priors such as Markov random fields [5] (with the fields based on the total-variation pseudo-norm and its approximations being particularly prominent examples [51, 13, 37] ), priors expressing sparsity in a transformed domain [24] , or learning-based priors like patch-based Gaussian mixture models [66, 62, 59 ]. Among these priors, log-concave models have been particularly favored for both computational and analytical reasons. With regards to computation, log-concavity leads to formulations for MAP estimation and uncertainty quantification which benefit from the full arsenal of convex optimization tools, scaling efficiently to high-dimensions, with strong and well-known convergence guarantees [14, 43, 11, 3, 44, 49] . Similarly, logconcavity also enables the use of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo sampling algorithms (see, e.g., [25, 46] ). Moreover, from an analytical viewpoint, log-concavity guarantees the well-posedness of p(x|y), and that xmap is formally a Bayesian estimator (as opposed to simply being the point with greatest density w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure, which is a significantly weaker result, see [45] for details).\nComputation of the MAP solution. When the posterior density p(.|y) is proper and differentiable, with ∇ log p(.|y) Lipschitz continuous, it is possible to use first-order optimisation methods to compute maximisers of p(.|y), i.e. MAP estimators. The simplest first order optimisation scheme to compute xmap is arguably the gradient descent algorithm, given by an initial state X 0 ∈ R d and the following recursion for all k ∈ N\nEQUATION\nwhere (δ k ) k∈N ∈ (R + ) N is a sequence of step-sizes. The sequence (X k ) k∈N converges to critical points of p(.|y) under mild assumptions on the sequence (δ k ) k∈N [42] and p(.|y). Alternatively, the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) variant\nEQUATION\nwhere {Z k : k ∈ N} is a family of i.i.d Gaussian random variables with zero mean and identity covariance matrix, is more robust to local minima and saddle points and hence more suitable when x → p(x|y) is not log-concave on R d [8, 6] . Of course, there are many optimisation schemes with better convergence properties than SGD (see, e.g., [42] in the convex case), as well as other dynamics to construct efficient optimisation algorithms [33, 67] . Nevertheless, SGD is straightforward to apply, robust, and has a detailed convergence theory, making it a valuable algorithm in the imaging scientist's toolbox.\nDeep learning approaches. In the last few years, deep neural networks have become ubiquitous to solve inverse problems in imaging, showing unmatched performances for point estimation for some specific problems like image denoising."}

Indeed, cellular-based infrastructures might become unavailable due to important damages. While MANETs can be quickly deployed without fixed infrastructure, setup or prior requirements, their flexibility is attractive when communications between victims and rescue teams are crucial. However, their implementations face an important challenge: proving that they are enough reliable compared to other approaches (Kiess and Mauve 2007) . While Verification and Validation (V&V) using real experimentations in emergency conditions is utterly impossible, simulation is an important tool in the MANET research community.\nSimulators are an inexpensive manner to evaluate the performance and the accuracy of algorithms and systems without the use of the actual hardware. Also, simulators allow checking the capacity of a network in extreme conditions by varying various parameters in a virtual way and checking different scenarios (Manpreet and Malhotra 2014) . However, although their use and development increased, the credibility of their results decreased over the time (Kurkowski et al. 2005 , Hogie et al. 2006 ). Among the problems encountered arXiv:2004.14093v1 [cs.DC] 29 Apr 2020 during the development of MANETs, some are inherent to simulation in general: repeatability, consistency, and accuracy of the models (Sargent 2001) . Particularly, simulators generally focus only on some aspects of the network structure itself without taking into account the complexity and the heterogeneity of the systems which rely on this network: autonomous vehicles, unmanned aircraft systems, communication software, etc.\nFor instance, Figure 1 shows an exemple of real MANET-based ecosystem in an emergency situation. Collaborative drones evolving in a complex environment must communicate without a fixed network infrastructure, send data to different rescue teams with real-time 3D processing software on mobile devices in order to allow professionals to evaluate the situation. Then, these data should also be saved in a database connected to internet in order to allow management teams to take important decisions. Decision support can also be assessed thanks to an Artificial Intelligence-Driven Decision Making Process (Phillips-Wren and Jain 2006)."}

The Google car tells the driver when it's time to take over.\r\n\r\nIn paragraph 2 it says \"Their cars have driven up to half a million miles without a crash...\" it may be safe but also dangerous if you don't know how to control it.

{"text": "Twenty quantum disruptors the size of Jupiter were arranged in an icosahedron at a lightminute's distance from a perfectly smooth ball the size of an apple. In two pictoseconds, each of these quantum disruptors would annihilate 16.7*10^9 tonnes of matter, teleported in from fourteen trillion siphon points across a galaxy called G563879255, and focus the energy on the ball. At the moment the energy makes contact with the ball's shell, about ten cubic centimeters at the center of the sphere will be carved out of the universe and injected into the theoretically-predicted parent universe in which our universe is contained. \n\nIf all goes as planned, the device would interact with the universe above it. This disruption could be controlled in order to transmit eighteen bytes of information, a fragment of an equation. If this attempt failed, it would be over fifteen years before another galaxy could be prepared to resend the message. \n\nA human in a ceremonial body flipped the ceremonial switch, initiating the process. A shell of energy swept outward from the center of the device in a process that would destroy G563879255 over the next fifty thousand years. \n\nThe most advanced particle collider ever constructed formed a thirteen thousand kilometer ring around a small moon, accelerating hadrons with eighteen zettaelectronvolts of energy. A team of researchers from across the solar system worked to analyze the data it produced. After three months of operation, the media began to comment on the rising secrecy around the facility. Excitement grew at the possibility that the experiment had finally revealed new physics that could hint at a path toward the fabled theory of everything, a single theoretical framework that describes all physics. \n\nThe principal investigators finally announced a press conference seven months after the experiments began. \n\nThe level of public interest was unprecedented for a scientific announcement and reporters crammed into every space in the auditorium. \n\nA being, which may have looked like a brightly-plumed spider to a human, walked to the podium as his colleagues assembled behind it. \n\nWhen everyone had come on stage, it began to speak. “ We've gathered here to announce that the Encenadex Hadron Colllider team has discovered the Theory of Everything. ” \n\nThe crowd was so excited that the sound of mandibles rubbing together became nearly deafening. The being at the podium motioned for silence. \n\n“ While this discovery promises to revolutionize every aspect of our lives, it may not be the most significant finding of this experiment. ” \n\nA dry scratching sound rose in the room, as beings rubbed up against their colleagues to whisper. \n\n“ The new particle we discovered lasts only for a tenth of a picosecond. In that time, it emits eighteen particles, either electrons or positrons. At first, we believed these to be random. Once we analysed millions of these decay events, we realized that each contained a piece of a very concise proof that revealed the theory to us.

Igualmente, la franquicia que cambió su historia desde la llegada de Gregg Popovich en 1996 cuenta con el récord de más presencia seguidas en dicha instancia.\nLos Spurs no se quedaron afuera de los playoffs por una derrota que sufrieron en el campo de juego, sino porque Milwaukee Bucks (1° del Este) no pudo derrotar a Memphis Grizzlies (8° del Oeste, por el momento).

{"text": "The algebraic theory of block codes is remarkably elaborated and has produced sophisticated algebraic classes of codes with associated decoding algorithms. On the contrary, there exist very few algebraic general constructions of convolutional codes and most of the existing convolutional codes that have good designed distance have been found by computer search.\nSince there is no easy algebraic approach to construct a generator matrix of convolutional codes with good distance properties, several authors have extended well-known classes of block codes to the convolutional context. This idea was initiated by Massey, Costello and Justesen, who used cyclic or quasi-cyclic block codes [19, 20, 27] . Later, the same idea was further developed by many authors; see [9, 22, 32, 14] . The idea of this approach is to establish a link between the generator polynomials of the quasi-cyclic block codes and the generator matrix of convolutional codes. The most important property of this connection is that it allows to lower bound the free distance of the convolutional code by the minimum distance of the associated cyclic or quasi-cyclic block code. Within this setting, many constructions of convolutional codes with designed free distance were provided based on different classes of block codes, such as Reed-Solomon or Reed-Muller codes. Moreover, in [31] , the authors adjusted the parameters of these constructions to present the first Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) convolutional code, i.e., a convolutional code whose free distance achieves the generalized Singleton bound presented in [30] , provided that the field size is congruent to 1 modulo the length of the code. Later, other examples of MDS convolutional codes, also for restricted set of parameters, were presented; see [12, 29] . It is worth to mention also the use of circulant Cauchy matrices for the construction of MDS 2D convolutional codes in [7, 8] , that was later adapted for MDS 1D convolutional codes in [24] . All these codes are designed in such a way that they have large free distance.\nIn the context of convolutional codes, one aims to build codes that can correct as many errors as possible in different time intervals. This property is measured by the notion of column distances. Despite the fact that this notion is arguably the most fundamental distance measure for convolutional codes (see [18, pag. 162] ), very little is known on how to build convolutional codes with large column distances. Moreover, having large free distance does not guarantee to have the largest possible column distances. Codes with maximum column distances are called Maximum Distance Profile (MDP) and they were introduced in [16] and further investigated in [13] ."}

He said Christ will judge not on how many times someone attends church services or fasts, but by their treatment of others.\n“He is, in this aspect, more revolutionary than we think and than we are. And he is showing us the way how to deal with each other, how to respect the human person without any prejudices,” the Most Rev. Elpidophoros said.\nThis was his first visit to Utah since being elected archbishop of America in May 2019. His predecessor visited the state in November 2000.\nGeorge Karahalios, parish council president for the Greek Orthodox Church of Greater Salt Lake, accompanied Archbishop Elpidophoros during his visit to Utah.\n“He is really quite a wonderful individual who understands the contemporary world and knows where he is leading us. That is what is so inspiring about him,” Karahalios said.\nThe Most Rev. Elpidophoros visited parishes in Ogden and Sandy, and two churches and one parish in Salt Lake City. Karahalios said the archbishop wanted to visit another parish in Price but there was not enough time to make the trip.\n“This is an unprecedented visit and we are so honored to have him here for such a long time,” Karahalios said. “It’s just something I probably won’t forget for the rest of my life.”\nKarahalios said Archbishop Elpidophoros particularly enjoyed discussing Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall’s tree initiative with her when they visited on Thursday.\n“I was grateful to hear his admiration of our tree planting efforts and his support for Salt Lake City and our endeavors around homelessness,” Mendenhall said on Twitter.\nBoth Mendenhall and Karahalios said they hope the archbishop can visit again in April to help plant trees in the city.\nGov. Spencer Cox met with the archbishop Wednesday at the Capitol.\n“He is standing up for the health of all Utahans and fighting back against anti-science rhetoric,” Archbishop Elpidophoros said in a tweet."}

{"text": "Self-supervised learning is a promising approach for learning visual representations: recent methods (He et al., 2020; Grill et al., 2020; Caron et al., 2020; Gidaris et al., 2021) reach the performance of supervised pretraining in terms of quality for transfer learning in many downstream tasks, like classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, etc. These methods rely on some prior knowledge on images: the semantic of an image is invariant (Misra & Maaten, 2020) to some small transformations of the image, such as cropping, blurring, color jittering, etc. One way to design an objective function that encodes such an invariance property is to enforce two different augmentations of the same image to have a similar representation (or embedding) when they are encoded by the neural network. However, the main issue with this kind of objective function is to avoid an undesirable loss of information (Jing et al., 2022) where, e.g., the network learns to represent all images by the same constant representation. Hence, one of the main challenges in self-supervised learning is to propose an efficient way to regularize the embedding distribution in order to avoid such a collapse.\nOur contribution is to propose a generic regularization loss promoting the embedding distribution to be close to the uniform distribution on the hypersphere, with respect to the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a distance on the space of probability measures based on the notion of embedding probabilities in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), using the so-called kernel mean embedding mapping. Inspired by high-dimensional statistical tests for uniformity that are rotation-invariant (García-Portugués & Verdebout, 2018) , we choose to embed probability distributions using rotationinvariant kernels on the hypersphere (dot-product kernels), i.e., kernels for which the evaluation for two vectors depends only on their inner product (Smola et al., 2000) . This paper shows that such an approach leads to important theoretical and practical consequences for self-supervised learning.\nFigure 1 : Self-supervised learning with rotation-invariant kernels.

{"text": "The recently proposed concept of the smart radio environment envisions fully programmable Electro-Magnetic (EM) propagation of information-bearing waveforms, which can be jointly optimized with transceiver signal processing [1] .\nA key technological enabler for this vision is the usage of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) [2] - [4] , which are artificial planar structures with nearly passive integrated electronic circuits whose reflection characteristics can be programmed to manipulate an incoming EM wave in a wide variety of functionalities [5] . Precursors of the underlying concepts began to emerge in the early 2000s [6] , [7] , followed by another wave of early works around 10 years later [8] - [10] .

By using design and analysis tools based on quasi-free-space assumptions, it has been also demonstrated that RISs can assist in overcoming harsh non Line-Of-Sight (LOS) conditions. Nonetheless, the smart radio environment concept envisions the deployment of RISs in indoor and dense urban setups, where the quasi-free-space assumption may not hold, and the channel is faithfully characterized by rich scattering models. In principle, the amount of scattering depends both on the radio propagation environment (e.g., its material properties and geometry) and the operating frequency band. In general, the higher the frequency is, the less scattering occurs. However, for operating frequencies below 6 GHz, as for example WiFi and typical cellular frequencies, many wireless communication scenarios take place in highly reverberant environments. Such environments appear in dense urban network deployments as well as inside vessels, planes, train/metro stations, malls, and even in rooms inside buildings.\nThe application of RISs in rich scattering environments requires a different approach than in quasi-free space, due to the fundamentally different nature of EM wave propagation which is characterized by strong multipath. In quasi-free space, wireless communications rely on directive beamforming. The transmitted information-bearing waveforms are captured by the receiver at a feasibly estimated angle-of-arrival and time intervals. However, in rich scattering environments, each scatterer acts like a random secondary source and the receiver captures a multitude of copies of the emitted waveform at seemingly random time instants from seemingly random angles of incidence. Often, there may not even exist a direct LOS path between the transmitter and receiver. These differences have two important consequences. First, due to the long Channel Impulse Response (CIR), the transceiver scheme needs to account for the presence of Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI), which impacts signal processing complexity and achievable rate performance."}
{"text": "R ECENT advancements have significantly expanded the use of 3D virtual human technology. Its growing appeal spans numerous applications, including animation, gaming, digital receptionists, and human-computer interaction. A major task in this research area is to create credible, personalized co-speech gestures. Speech-driven gesture generation through deep learning provides a cost-effective solution, eliminating the need for manual intervention associated with conventional motion capture systems.\nHowever, the primary challenges in speech-driven gesture generation face precisely identifying the vast array of input conditions necessary for driving gesture synthesis. This complexity arises because co-speech gestures are shaped by an extensive range of factors, including acoustics, semantics, emotions, personality traits, and demographic variables like gender, age, etc.\nPrevious approaches [1] - [7] have explored the use of man-ual labels and diverse feature inputs to facilitate the synthesis of personalized gestures. Nonetheless, these methods depend heavily on various unstructured feature inputs and require complex multimodal processing. These approaches present a significant barrier to the practical application and broader adoption of virtual human technologies. The fuzzy inference strategy, which pertains to the concept of fuzzy logic [8] , is particularly useful in the field for dealing with uncertain or imprecise information. The fuzzy inference strategy is known for its effectiveness in speech-emotion recognition [9] and audio classification [10] . These methods do not necessarily require explicit classification outputs but instead provide fuzzy feature information, which broadens the explicit discrete space into an expansive implicit continuous fuzzy space. The information in fuzzy space better aligns with the actual scenario. Relevantly, research in psychology highlights the significance of various factors in speech [11] - [14] . These factors, called fuzzy features, are intricately intertwined with co-speech gestures. These studies present novel opportunities for synthesizing personalized gestures based solely on speech audio, thereby simplifying the feature inputs and reducing the complexity of multimodal processing.\nAnother challenge in this field is ensuring a high level of gesture-speech synchronization while preserving naturalness. Recent developments have focused on the application of Transformer and Diffusion-based models. This methodological shift has led to substantial progress in the efficiency and flexibility of gesture-generation technologies. Key examples of such innovative efforts include Taming [15] , Diffuse Style Gesture [2] , Diffuse Style Gesture+ [3] , GestureDiffuClip [16] , and LDA [4] . Yet, these approaches encounter challenges with either insufficient or excessive correlation between gesture and speech, reducing the naturalness of the generated gestures."}

{"text": "Microservices have emerged as a pivotal change in the software industry, paving the way to a novel paradigm for structuring the software development process. This novel approach entails multiple independent teams responsible \"from development to deploy\" [31] of loosely coupled independently deployable services [30, 31] . Due to their modular nature, microservices are particularly well-suited for the modern software industry, where rapidly releasing software updates and enhancements is a critical competitive advantage [34] .\nAlthough beneficial in many aspects, microservices also introduce new challenges, especially when it comes to maintaining consistent software performance. This complexity arises from various elements. Firstly, the inherent complexity of these systems often hinders the adoption of proactive measures for performance assurance [38, 45] , such as pre-production performance testing [17, 21, 42] . Secondly, these proactive measures are often hampered by time and resource constraints due to the substantial pressure to deliver fast-to-market [34, 40] . Thirdly, microservices systems typically exhibit an emergent performance behavior in the field that is hard to predict in advance [45] . Finally, these systems undergo continuous software changes, with multiple releases occurring on a daily basis, and handle highly variable workloads [3] , which make them more vulnerable to unforeseen performance regressions [43, 45] .\nThese challenges have led to an increased interest in the concept of observability [29] , i.e., the ability to have a holistic understanding of the system's performance by analyzing its logs, traces, and metrics. Distributed tracing tools [32] are today widely used in practice to enhance observability of microservices systems [28] . These tools track and record the propagation of requests as they flow through different RPCs and services of a microservices system [35] , and provide visual aids to support performance analysis of end-to-end requests, e.g., swimlane visualizations [10, 37, 39] .\nDespite their utility, distributed tracing tools have recently been criticized for their limited support for performance analysis [10] . A common use case for these tools is the analysis of the system-wide performance behavior [32] , such as understanding the response time distributions of end-to-end requests [10] . However, current distributed tracing tools often fall short in this area, necessitating a switch between various visualization tools, which can make the process cumbersome and time-consuming [10] . Indeed, they primarily focus on the analysis of individual requests, which has limited value unless it is compared with the performance behavior of the entire corpus of requests [2, 10, 32] .\nIn this paper, we introduce vamp, an innovative visual analytics tool designed to enhance the performance analysis of microservices systems. vamp extends the conceptual proposal of Leone and Traini [22] . The fundamental idea underpinning vamp is to simplify the understanding of the relationship between request characteristics and end-to-end response time behavior through interactive charts and color-encoding techniques. vamp comprises two main visualization components: an interactive tree that illustrates the workflow in terms of RPCs for multiple end-to-end requests, and an interactive histogram representing the end-to-end performance behavior of the requests under analysis. Interaction with these visual components aids in identifying the unique characteristics of certain RPC execution paths with respect to some specific system performance behaviors.\nWe evaluate vamp using 33 datasets derived from TrainTicket [47] , an open-source microservices system widely utilized in previous software engineering research [23, 41, 46] . Our findings demonstrate that vamp enables the identification of notable and recurrent request characteristics associated with specific end-to-end response time behaviors.\nA video of vamp in action can be accessed at https://youtu.be/ qMVOMt06EJE. The swimlane visualisation is the canonical way to visualize individual requests within distributed tracing tools [9, 19, 37, 39] . Fig. 1 shows a representative example of a swimlane visualization. The visualization depicts a timeline of a single request, with RPCs depicted horizontally and sorted vertically to highlight their relationships. This type of visualization proves highly beneficial for performance analysis of individual requests, allowing for a detailed investigation into how each RPC affects the overall end-to-end response time."}

{"text": "N modern power systems, voltage source converters (VSCs) are among the most common power electronic devices. Typical application scenarios of VSCs range from the renewable energy generation, such as wind farms, to high-voltage DC and flexible AC transmission systems [1] - [3] . The existing literature [3] - [8] shows that with the high penetration of power converters, the dynamic characteristics of the power system have undergone significant changes, so that new oscillatory phenomena have emerged, threatening system stability. Some of these phenomena are associated with VSC control.\nAcross industry and academia, there is a consensus that locating the sources of oscillation is an important measure to suppress oscillation [9] , [10] . Correspondingly, in [11] , numerous methods for oscillation source location (OSL) were surveyed and categorized; the most notable is the energy-based method (EBM) [12] , which tracks the system-wide energy flow to locate the oscillation sources. The advantages of the EBM include the following: (i) compared to the location methods based on damping torque analysis or mode shape estimation, the EBM is adapted to locate forced oscillations as well as poorly damped oscillations [11] ; and (ii) the EBM is convenient for voltage/current measurements in wide-area networks [12] , [13] . With the rapid development of phasor measurement units (PMU), the EBM has been successfully used for oscillation monitoring in actual power systems [14] . Thus, this study focuses on the EBM considering its prospects for industrial applications.\nIn recent years, the EBM has been developed. For example, Wu et al. [13] proposed a distributed cooperative scheme to locate a forced oscillation source by detecting a cut-set energy flow. In addition, some studies focused on the oscillations associated with wind farms. Ma et al. [15] developed an equipment-level locating method for low-frequency oscillation sources in power systems with doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) integration, based on an energy correlation topology network and dynamic energy flow. Lei et al. [16] presented a forced oscillation source location and participation assessment method for DFIGs by analyzing the energy flow, and based on this analysis, the participation factor for oscillations is proposed.\nReviewing [13] , [15] , and [16] , the formulas for energy flow, which are suitable for low-frequency OSL, were derived from [12] and proven in [17] and [18] to conform with the dissipativity theory. However, according to [4] and [6] , there is a risk of sub-synchronous oscillation (SSO) in multi-VSC systems; therefore, the analysis of transient energy flow (TEF)"}

{"text": "The \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" had many people talking and asking if there was alien life on another planet. Obviously that is not true because they had pictures that it was just a landform,it could have been a rock, and this has happened before, it is very common. The \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" does not prove that there is another life on Mars.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the face is a natural landform, a picture is proof of it being a landform. They also took pictures of the so called face and determined that it was a landform. In the passage it says \" When Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\"\r\n\r\nThe picture was the proof in the pudding. Therefore there was not alien monument.\r\n\r\nSecondly, this face on mars could be a rock. The world has seen many of weird shaped rocks to consider that the face was a weirdly shaped rock. In the passage it says \" A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.\" The thing about rocks are that they can come from anywhere, can be found anywhere, can look like anything, and can be anything."}

{"text": "League of Legends (LoL), a popular computer game developed by Riot Games, is currently the most widely played Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) [3] game in the world. In 2019, there were eight million concurrent players daily [14] , and the player base has continued to grow since its release in 2009. A core aspect of LoL is competitive ranked gameplay. In typical ranked gameplay, ten human players are matched together to form two teams of approximately equal skill. These two teams, consisting of five players each, battle against each other to destroy the opposing team's base.\nFair matchmaking is crucial for player experience [31] . In 2019, Riot Games stated that ranked matchmaking should be as fair as possible [11] . This goal has persisted throughout the history of the game. In 2020, Riot Games stated that some of their main goals for the year were to preserve competitive integrity [12] and improve matchmaking quality [13] for ranked games. In order to create fair matches between players of approximately equivalent skill level, matchmaking is determined using an Elo rating system, similar to the one originally used by chess players [26] . Although this matchmaking system has improved in recent years (c.f., [10, 11, 13] ), it does not consider players' champion selections when forming matches. LoL has over 150 playable characters, known as champions, that have their own unique playstyles and abilities [7] . Players select a champion at the start of every match after the matchmaking algorithm has formed teams. However, players will often perform better on some champions than on others due to their differing levels of mechanical expertise, which is defined as a player's knowledge of their champion's abilities and interactions [8] . Higher levels of mechanical expertise on particular champions allow players to make quicker and better judgments, which are essential in the game's fast paced environment. Since mechanical expertise plays such a large impact on a player's own performance, it can therefore cause a similar impact on the match's outcome.\nIn this paper, we introduce a machine learning model based on a deep neural network (DNN) that can predict ranked match outcomes based on players' experience on their selected champion (i.e., player-champion experience)."}
{"text": "It was always the same thing, usually. \n\nA man accused of a crime was brought before the statue. \n\nAlways, the statue decided. \n\nAnd judgement came swiftly. Always, one of her hands moved. The right, with the sword - a guilty verdict, or the left, with the scales - not guilty. \n\nThere was no such thing as court. The statue was never wrong. \n\nAt least people thought so. Justice herself was bestowing these verdicts, and who were they to question her, a goddess? \n\nOne day, however, a man was brought to trial. Found amidst the bloody entrails of his wive and child. Of course, his head was severed in an instant. \n\nExcept in this case, after a few weeks had passed, someone else entirely confessed to the murder. How he'd staged it. How he'd shifted the blame on the poor mean who now lay dead and rotting in the pit with the rest of the criminals - no one who was guilty was deserving of a proper burial after all. \n\nBut how?! How in the world could Justice have been wrong? \n\nAnd what would she do with him? \n\nIt didn't take them long to present the murderer to their goddess. To have him kneel in the same place the innocent man had knelt, and look up at the blindfolded image of Justice. \n\nAnd there was nothing. Not for hours. People began to murmur quickly, then shouted. And just when a riot was about to break out, she moved. Dropped her scales, and dropped her sword. \n\nAnd stepped down from the pedestal. The stone cracked and crunched against each other, while she approached the murderer. One hand gripped his skull, the other tore at the blindfold. Since it was part of the statue, there was no way it could come off, but what lay beneath was revealed. \n\nPulsing, bleeding flesh. The crimson liquid oozed from the jagged wounds in the stone, and finally revealed the terrible truth of their goddess. No word was spoken, but everyone knew regardless. Justice wasn't just at all. She had judged how the people had wanted her to judge. \n\nAnd right now, the people wanted blood. So much so, that the Statue tore her mouth open and revealed teeth more akin to an animal than to a human."}

{"text": "Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because, Venus used to have bodies of water and had many different forms of life. There are other explanations like having a surface of rocky sediment and includes valleys, mountains, and craters. So they Venus might be the only other planet that can probably support life.\r\n\r\nThere are so things that can't be done. It might've supported life back then but now the average surface temperature is 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experienced. So landing on Venus is almost impossible for humans. Also Venus has the hottest surface tempature of any planet in our solar system because of all the erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and the frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.\r\n\r\nAlthough, these conditions are pretty bad, The National Aeronatuics and Space Administration (NASA) has one compelling idea for senbding humans to study Venus. NASA possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. For example its like a jet airplane that travles at a high altitude to fly over storms. So a vehicle overing over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.\r\n\r\nHowever, peering above the ground from a ship can only limited insight on the ground because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers can't take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."}
{"text": "Space travel is not new to humanity nor is it something that has not already been accomplished. With the breach of Mars's soil having already occured scientist and space explorers have set their sights on the next challenge, Venus. Venus is sometimes closer to Earth than Mars and at other times Mars is the one closer to Earth, but of the two Venus is the closest match to Earth \"in terms of density and size\" and thus has been named Earth's \"twin\" making it a place of great interest for scientist, and those interested in space exploration because no other planet comes as close to matching Earth's conditions. Studying Venus could give hints about the future of Earth.\r\n\r\nIn \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" the author gives strong support to the idea that the pursuit of studying Venus is a worthy cause despite the dangers presented by the task. Knowledge of Venus would be extremely beneficial because Venus is one of the most interesting planets in Earth's solar system because of it's similarity to Earth. With the large number of similarities that Venus currently shares with Earth it wouldn't be terribly surprising or strange if Venus was once a planet \"covered largely with oceans and\" that \"could support various forms of life\". There is no way to tell if any of this is true, however without being able to travel to Venus and explore the planet. Only by exploring the planet and studying pieces of the planet such as small bits of land can noteworthy discoveries about Venus be made. Confirming or disproving the Earth-like Venus idea is not the only reason why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit."}
{"text": "Every flap of her leathery wings cause the air to tremble as she soars across the mountains she calls home. Scales a burnished red, sunlight glints off her in scintillating patterns. The early morning mist dissipates in her wake as she glides over the plains, reveling in her dominion of this kingdom. \n\nShe is well content in her domain, a large swathe of land dotted with the crude buildings of her two-legged cattle. At her shadow, one of the cattle cries out a warning to the others and they scatter. She dives, and breathes out a lick of flame, but her heart wasn't really in it, having eaten a wild goat earlier that day. She'd grown fat on their tributes of oxen and sheep, but sometimes she still snaps up a few of them just for variety's sake. \n\nThe only thing bothering her is her meagre hoard back in her dragon's den, a deep crevasse carved deep into the mountainside. She'd scoured the plains and the settlements, had even fought off a couple of lesser drakes outside her domain for their own treasure, but in the end her trove was still unsatisfactory. A miserably small heap of silver and copper coins, a golden chalice and a suit of gilded armor. Nowhere near acceptable. \n\nAs she flies over her domain, a gleam beneath the cloudbanks attracts her gaze. Turning, she sees a golden shine down below at the riverside. She dives down from the skies, ready to claim the prize for her own, only to spill air in surprise as the object revealed itself to be alive. \n\nIt hadn't seemed to notice her yet, the sinuous serpentine *thing* drinking at her river. It had a lustrous mane and a pair of fine whiskers, which it was fastidiously cleaning in the clear waters below. A small pair of curled horns protruded from its mane. The creature was small, barely half her size. And it was covered in golden scales. \n\nAfter a while of lapping at the stream, the creature turns its head towards her. She blinks, uncertain for a moment. None of her prey had been so calm before. But uncertainty gave way to her desire to add to her small hoard, and she lunged from the skies, claws ready to rend at the intruder. No fire, for she did not want to damage her prize. \n\nBut the wingless beast takes to the air, effortlessly climbing the thermals. She turns, snapping at its tufted tail. The creature coils in midair, twisting its snakelike body this way and that. Now it faced her rush head-on as she followed it into the skies, wings beating at the air. \n\nShe startles as the creature leapt forward, uncoiling as it shot towards her even as she approached it.

{"text": "Best arm identification (BAI) addresses the challenge of finding the optimal arm in a bandit environment (Lattimore and Szepesvári, 2020), with wide-ranging applications in online advertising, drug discovery or hyperparameter tuning. BAI is commonly approached through two primary paradigms: fixed-confidence and fixed-budget. In the fixed-confidence setting (Even-Dar et al., 2006; Kaufmann et al., 2016) , the objective is to find the optimal arm with a pre-specified confidence level. Conversely, fixed-budget BAI (Audibert et al., 2010; Karnin et al., 2013; Carpentier and Locatelli, 2016) involves identifying the optimal arm within a fixed number of observations. Within this fixed-budget context, two main metrics are used: the probability of error (PoE) (Audibert et al., 2010; Karnin et al., 2013; Carpentier and Locatelli, 2016) -the likelihood of incorrectly identifying the optimal arm-and the simple regret (Bubeck et al., 2009; Russo, 2016; Komiyama et al., 2023) -the expected performance disparity between the chosen and the optimal arm. We focus on PoE minimization in fixed-budget BAI.\nExisting algorithms for PoE minimization in fixed-budget BAI are largely frequentist and often employ elimination strategies. Bayesian approaches have predominantly focused on the minimization of the simple regret (Komiyama et al., 2023; Azizi et al., 2023) , or were studied under a frequentist lens (Hoffman et al., 2014) , which do not capture the advantages of knowing informative priors. It was only recently that Atsidakou et al. (2022) introduced a Bayesian version of the well-known Sequential Halving (SH) algorithm (Karnin et al., 2013) , offering a prior-dependent bound on the probability of error in multi-armed bandits (MAB), albeit under certain limiting assumptions on the prior. Their proofs are still largely influenced by frequentist approaches and come with strong constraints.\nSeveral recent works have shed new light on adaptive methods for frequentist fixed-budget BAI. For instance, Qin (2022); Degenne (2023) ; Wang et al. (2023) examined whether adaptive algorithms can consistently surpass the best static algorithm for any bandit instance. Remarkably, Degenne (2023) established the absence of such universally superior adaptive algorithms in several BAI problems, including Gaussian BAI. Wang et al. (2023) demonstrated that in Bernoulli BAI with two arms, no algorithm consistently outperforms uniform sampling. Inspired by these recent results, we develop a method based on fixed and non-adaptive allocations in the Bayesian setting. These allocations leverage both prior information and the structure of the environment. As demonstrated in our experiments in Section 5, our static but prior-informed algorithm can outperform adaptive baselines. Moreover, our proofs incorporate fully Bayesian techniques, diverging from existing works. This novel technical approach not only produces a tighter upper bound but also applies under milder assumptions.\nAs a motivating example, consider a scenario with three arms (K = 3), where the information a priori strongly suggests that either of the first two arms is more likely to be optimal than the third one. A pivotal question arises: what strategic approach should be employed to allocate resources (or budget) to the seemingly suboptimal third arm?"}

A lifetime of long Eastern winters had hardened my body, yet I was always taken aback at that first gust of cold air after the steam from my shower had dissipated. It did not matter that I was in California where the weather could have kept me in shorts every day, that gust still sent shivers down my spine. \n\nAs I toweled off and got ready for my show later that evening, I was in awe. I was finally going to do it. I had wasted so many years wanting this from afar, and I was finally ready to take it. No more tears. No more needless explanations. This was my time. I would finally overcome my fear and conquer my demons. \n\nDespite being in an isolated bathroom, I could tell that the house was strangely quiet. There always seemed to be something going on in my family, but for some reason I heard nothing. \n\nI decided that the youngest kids must in school, and everyone else at work. I knew my wife was home, but she was probably passed out, too much vodka. That was no problem, I was already ready for the show and I knew she would want to share in this experience with me. Hopefully she would be awake once I got home and had time to take my costume off. \n\nI reached for the door handle, eager and anxious to finally begin my new, normal life. I told myself that if I could make it through Med School, I could make it through this. This would not even be the most radical change I had ever made. I had switched careers before, why could I not switch something so simple? \n\nI opened the door and I saw her. My wife was not passed out, far from it. She was kneeling on the edge of our bed wearing nothing but a tiny red tank top that said \"Slut\" across the chest. \n\nI had to have her. It had been so long. I had been questioned so many times. But I was ready. My God, I was ready to ravage my wife. The show be damned! This had to happen now. \n\nShe looked at me and smiled. She then winked and pat on the bed right beside her. I knew I had to sit. \n\n\"You're looking marvelous tonight, dear\" she said. \n\n\"You're not looking to bad yourself, my lady\" I slyly replied. \n\n\"Why don't we get comfortable?\" \n\n\"I thought you'd never ask.\" \n\nWe embraced.

This includes manual features, such as hand shape, movement and pose as well as non-manuals features, such as facial expression, mouth and movement of the head, shoulders and torso [5] .\nThe goal of sign language translation is to either convert written language into a video of sign (production) [59, 60] or to extract an equivalent spoken language sentence from a video of someone performing continuous sign [9] . However, in the field of computer vision, much of this latter work 1 Linguists refer to these channels as articulators. has focused on recognising the sequence of sign glosses2 (Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR)) rather than the full translation to a spoken language equivalent (Sign Language Translation (SLT)). This distinction is important as the grammar of sign and spoken languages are very different. These differences include (to name a few): different word ordering, multiple channels used to convey concurrent information and the use of direction and space to convey the relationships between objects. Put simply, the mapping between speech and sign is complex and there is no simple word-to-sign mapping. Generating spoken language sentences given sign language videos is therefore a spatio-temporal machine translation task [9] . Such a translation system requires us to accomplish several sub-tasks, which are currently unsolved:\nSign Segmentation: Firstly, the system needs to detect sign sentences, which are commonly formed using topiccomment structures [62] , from continuous sign language videos. This is trivial to achieve for text based machine translation tasks [48] , where the models can use punctuation marks to separate sentences. Speech-based recognition and translation systems, on the other hand, look for pauses, e.g. silent regions, between phonemes to segment spoken language utterances [69, 76] ."}

Brady les envió un dardo a los Cowboys através de su Instagram Story.\n“9/9 no puede llegar más rápido. Emocionad por comenzar contra ‘America’s Team,’” dijo Brady con un meme haciendo un guiño.\nBrady claramente estaba mofando del apodo de los Cowboys al ser “America’s Team.” Cabe reconocer que Brady se crió en California como fanático de los 49ers durante los 80 y 90, en el momento más intenso de la rivalidad entre Dallas y San Francisco en la NFL.\nDespués de días de varios rumores, la NFL confirmó que los Buccaneers recibirán la visita de los Cowboys el jueves, 9 de septiembre para comenzar la temporada 2021. Los actuales campeones del Super Bowl ahora son amplios favoritos contra los Cowboys.\nBrady ha odiado a los Cowboys ‘Desde que nació’\nBrady ha hablado sobre su disgusto por los Cowboys cuando reflejaba sobre el tema previo al partido contra los Cowboys en el 2019 cuando estaba con New England. Él admitió que “no le han gustado a los Cowboys desde el día que nació.”\n“No me han gustado los Cowboys desde que salí del utero como fanático de los Niners,” dijo Brady en ese momento, vía Pro Football Talk. “Pero tengo mucho respeto por los que están allí y han tenido una organización ganadora. Han tenido grandes jugadores en su historia. Jugadores que yo, como fanático de los 49ers, cuando jugabas contra los Cowboys y cada vez que le entregaban el balón a Emmitt Smith y terminaría en cinco yardas y te arrancarías el pelo. Y después le lanzan el balón a Michael Irvin y Troy [Aikman] era un gran jugador, y la defensiva con Ken Norton y Prime Time [Deion Sanders].\nCreo que esa historia de grandes jugadores, la tradición, conocer a Roger Staubach a través de los años, es un tipo genial. Alguien admiras. Y lo que están haciendo con el equipo que tienen. Es uno de los equipos más talentosos en la NFL que juegan de manera genial en ofensiva, defensiva y va a ser un gran reto para nosotros.”\nLos Bucs son favoritos por casi un touchdown sobre los Cowboys\nLas Vegas parece estar al lado de Brady ya que los Buccaneers tienen una ventaja de 6.5 por encima de los Cowboys en el primer partido de la temporada, de acuerdo a OddsShark. Los Bucs son el primer equipo ganador de SUper Bowl en la historia de la NFL en tener a sus 22 titulares regresar. Dallas llega después de una temporada decepcionante después de la primera temporada de Mike McCarthy’s como entrenador.\nLos Cowboys estuiveron durante toda la temporada libre rearmando su defensa con nuevo fichajes comenzando con el coordinador defensivo Dan Quinn. Dallas enocó su draft con todos jugadores defensivos, pero la unidad estará probada contra la ofensiva de los Buccaneersfocused almost their entire draft on defensive players, but the unit will be put to the test early against a prolific Buccaneers."}

{"text": "Harry looked at the 3 jars on the bench before him. 1 was filled with a deep red liquid. It seemed thin, and a quarter of it was empty. The 2nd was filled with what appeared to be incredibly misty water, bubbles forming at the top. It was filled to the brim, seeming untouched. The 3rd looked similar to the 2nd, it was water as well. However, this liquid was the clearest of the 3. This was the emptiest one, as it was half empty. (Yes, Harry was a pessimist.) \n\nThe inscriptions on the grand walls around him peeled off the walls, crawling along the ground like inchworms. Behind the desk, they twirled around each other, building up until they formed a large shadowy clawed hand. The middle of the hand bulged, opened, and revealed a small green singular eye. Harry realised that they both shared similar traits: they both had 1 eye & 1 hand. \n\n\"Um.... hello! I am Death! How are.... how are you today?\" \n\n\"You're Death?\" \n\n\"Yep. That's me.

On the counter?\" \n\n\"Yep.\" \n\n\"Great. 1 is filled with.... uh.... blood. I'm ashamed of that, really. The 2nd jar is full of...\" \n\nDeath closed his eye and sighed. \n\n``.... sweat. It's filled with sweat. I know. Gross. Who came up with this? OK, so.... the third one. That's filled with tears. That one isn't so bad.\" \n\nHarrys eyes widened, realising the situation he was in. \n\n\"Where did you get these?\" he stammered, pointing at them and leaning back cautiously. \n\n\"Doesn't matter. Look, I just need you to pick one. Please.\" \n\n\"No, you sicko!\" Harry screamed, scrunching up his face. \n\n``.... You're breaking my hearts. All 4 of them. Really.

Did you REALLY have to choose SWEAT?!? WHY DO YOU THINK THE SWEAT JAR IS FULL?!? ***\" \n\nDeaths eye glowed bright red, almost blinding Harry in his only eye. Slowly, it dimmed, and Death took deep breaths that seemed to appear from nowhere. \n\n\"Fine. FINE. You chose sweat. To receive your trial, yo-\" \n\n\"Hold up. Trial?

{"text": "Students Expressions\r\n\r\nEveryday people are coming up with new technology to help the students learn in class. They give them computers and let them use phones and calculators. But the new software that can identify students emtions is going to help in so many diffent ways. The Facial Action Coding System will not only help the student but also help the teacher. If a student is feeling a certain emotion and doesn't want to participate in class that day then the teacher can help them due to their emotion. One other reason FACS could help, is with all the school shootings that are happening you could detect that a student was mad or sad because of a bully and help them before they do something disasterous. Another reason FACS could help is to stop a bully. If the software can dectect happiness it can detect hatred and it would be helpful in many schools if they could stop a bully before the bully found a victim. These are the some of the many reasons why the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable in school.\r\n\r\nIn many classrooms students hardly ever show up to school ready to work and learn. With the FACS teachers could use it to help those students and make sure they do their work so they student can suceed. Then on the other hand if a student is ready to work and very energetic the teacher can help them learn at their pace. Most students would agree and say that learning is hard if its not at your own pace. With FACS the teachers can learn what the students pace is and teach them accordingly.\r\n\r\nSchool shootings are becoming a regular thing in America and most of America feels the way I do; they need to stop. Students have emotions that lead them to committing acts of terror like this and the FACS would be able to detect if a student was sad or mad because of a bully. All the teacher or adult would have to do is talk to them and it could be avoided. The most effective way to stop a disaster of that magnitude is stop it before it happens. With the Facial Action Coding System it could easily be stopped.\r\n\r\nBullies are everywhere in schools: classroom, hallways, cafeteria, bathrooms, etc."}

{"text": "The new techonology tht is called Facial Action Coding System is beinng use to identify human emotions. If this were to be used in a classroom some kids might not want to be scanned and have there emotions known. So I honestly think that this machine or new piece of techonology should not be used in classrooms and heres why.\r\n\r\nTo start it off I can already tell that some kids will not want there emotions to be known. That's something that the kid is able to keep a secret. If the kids doesn't want there emotions to be known then he or she has the right to not let them be known. Now in paragraph 6 a quote from Dr. Huang \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\" Now although it is true that some kids may need help for the work that there doing. They may not understand it and that's where the computer comes in. But the teacher can't just scan the kids face and have the computer do all the work. The teacher has to also know when a kid is having troube with the material. Obviously it's almost impossible to know how every student is doing but if you see a kid getting bad grades on the material then the teacher should help the student out. That goes back to if the student actually wants to be scanned to identify his or her emotions.\r\n\r\nA quote from Dr. Huang \" The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show carying degrees of expression.\" That's is also another thing that I want to talk about. The teacher really has to care for his or her students. It's the teachers job to make sure that a kid is doing good in school. I do understand that there are some kids that just don't even try. Those kids are difficult to make them succeed. But for the other students the teacher has to know if he or she is having a bad day. You could ask whats wrong and if the student doesn't want to tell you then they don't have to. But the teachers have to make sure that the student knows that the teacher is there to help. Now although some kids hide there expressions really well I guess that's\r\n\r\nwhen you would want the maching to scan there face. But as I keep saying only if they want to. The teacher might have a problem on knowing how a kid feels and knowing there emotion. But if the student doesn't want there emotion to be known thats what the kid wants. In many ways we don't need a maching to help with human proteries. Thats why humans talk to humans anout there emotions not humans talk to machines.\r\n\r\nI hope that this new techonology is going towards high schools. In this day and age so many high schcoolers are going through alot."}

{"text": "Falazal - sorry, \"Falazaliel\" - liked her new den; it was a little white for her tastes and the furniture was made some kind of old wood - oak maybe? - that smelled faintly of mint. It was her least favourite smell and she was dead set on changing it to something more pleasant, like ash or candle wax. She supposed that the aesthetic and design choices probably came with the new boss though. The big G.o.d. up top had always been the enemy of her last patron - something about a spat they'd had millenia ago and had never gotten over - and was apparently a really really big fan of plants and the colour white. \n\nAllegedly, God was a tyrant who would smite whomever they felt like and had once flooded the world for shits and giggles. By all accounts, it was some pretty high level stuff. It turns out that was mostly all rumours and heresay; the old demons and devils had been lying, or at least exaggerating, because when Falazal had come to God looking to turn a new leaf, she'd been given a job and a den - sorry, \"office\" - in a heartbeat. So much for Ol'Smitty, eh? No, instead she'd been given the admittedly low level grunt work of keeping the in-flow of Deeds filed away into either the \"Good\" folder or the \"Bad\" one. Falazal didn't mind, she'd been the head torturer of Hell for the few centuries she'd been alive and that had been stressful enough to make her quit. A couple millenia of easy work would do her some good, really get her back to her roots and letting her do things she could enjoy during her own personal time. \n\nFalazal suppressed a shudder as the clock on the wall chimed once; it was time to start her first shift! The Deeds started to pile in, stacking themselves high on her desk as every human act in the world came flooding through the offices of all the working staff of Heaven. Her stack was supposed to be smaller than everyone elses, being a new member and a demon to boot, but already Fal felt like she had ages of work in front of her. Sighing, she picked up the first Deed: \n\n* Name: Robert Haim. \n* Occupation: Carpenter. \n* Family: None. \n* Deed: Stole from his neighbour by piggybacking onto their cable service. \n\nHm, that's a good deed, Falazal thought to herself. It didn't really hurt anyone, so she couldn't have called it a bad deed. It wasn't even really on the scale of things the people in Hell had done. She moved on to the next Deed: \n\n* Name: Amanda Caler. \n* Occupation: Lawyer. \n* Family: Divorced, Daughter. \n* Deed: Was late to a client's meeting due to a small fight with her ex-husband over who would be picking up their daughter from school. \n\nThis one was definitely a bad deed. The woman clearly fought with someone over something small and inconsequential and she was late to a professional meeting with someone who was paying her. Plus, she was a lawyer! If Fal knew anything it was that she'd yet to meet even a single lawyer in Heaven for the millions she'd tortured in Hell. This one was a guaranteed sinner; she placed the file in the bad deeds tray. \n\nImmediately, a phone materialized beside her stack of Deeds and started ringing. It had the caller's ID on it: GOD. The boss is probably calling to tell me what good work I've been doing for my first day, Falazaliel beamed. She subconsciously tucker her hair behind her horns and calmed herself as she picked up the phone, working hard to keep the glee from her voice. \n\n\"Hello Boss, this is Falazaliel, how can I help you? I'm doing well on my first day, aren't I?\" she almost winked out of habit - it could get you far in Hell's lower echelons - but she stopped herself. Largely because it wasn't a video call. \n\n\"Well Falazaliel-\" the genderless voice of God began before Fal cut it off. \n\n\"You can call me Fal when it's just us talking, boss!\" \n\n\"Well Falazaliel, I don't quite know how to say this but it's actually rather the opposite.\" God sighed, \"I understand you're just starting to learn, and I applaud your go-getter attitude with skipping out on the tutorials I sent you when you first got here, but you really should review what Good and Bad mean up here. It's really not the same logic as you used to use back in Hell.\" \n\nFalazaliel pouted, legitimately saddened to find out she could be doing better, \"Oh don't worry, I'm sure I'll get the hang of it. I was always a quick learner back for Ol' Satan; I'll blow through these Deeds in no time and I'll get them all sorted just like you want. Haim's deed was bad and Caler's was good? You got it.\" \n\nGod almost audibly cringed when Fal said Satan's name, but did a good job of hiding it from her, \"Alright Falazaliel, I'll be monitoring your progress. I just don't want anyone going to the wrong place because of a clerical oversight. Expect me to come down there if you still aren't understanding the nuances within the hour.\""}

Nadal, en las otras finales, todas ganadas, no había cedido un solo set más.\nEn el momento de la verdad, el set decisorio, tanto Nadal como Tsitsipas guardaron bien sus saques. Pero, en el quinto de Nadal, el griego tuvo una bola de partido, la primera para él, que salvó un manacorí agresivo en los momentos clave y que subió con criterio a la red para defender su territorio. Aunque, enfrente, el griego también subía con agallas para dar más nivel a esta gran final.\nCon 5-5, se mascaba un nuevo 'tie break'. Servía Stefanos Tsitsipas, y Nadal tuvo cuatro bolas de rotura. En la cuarta, Tsitsipas se hundió y la mandó fuera, dejando a Nadal sirviendo para cerrar el partido. El griego pasó del 30-0 al 30-40, y Nadal cortó la reacción. En el 'deuce', se puso arriba en su tercer 'match ball' --tras los dos del segundo set-- y Tsitsipas volvió a irse largo."}

These components are affected by a wide range of anthropogenic activities (e.g., agricultural intensification) and climate perturbations (e.g., wildfire, rain-on-snow, rising temperatures and precipitation, earlier snowmelt in mountainous regions). [1] [2] [3] . Watershed models can also assess the sustainability of the water supply for effective water resource management. Some popular and open-source watershed modeling software that can accurately simulate various components of water cycling in intensively managed watersheds include the Soil and Water Assessment Tool SWAT and its variants (e.g., SWAT-MRMT-R) [4] [5] [6] , the Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (ATS) [7] , the Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) [8, 9] , the Weather Research and Forecasting Model Hydrological modeling system (WRF-Hydro) [10, 11] , RHESSys [12] , VIC [13] , MIKE-SHE [14] , DHSVM [15] , and HSPF [16] .\nThe software mentioned above has process models that simulate the watersheds' different hydrological components (e.g., infiltration, groundwater flow, streamflow). Watershed hydrologic models feature two types of parameters [17, 18] . The first type includes parameters with physical significance (e.g., permeability, porosity) [19] that can be determined from observational data. The second type of parameters is conceptual or empirical, which are currently impossible or difficult to measure directly. Most of the watershed simulators mentioned above (e.g., SWAT, PRMS) consist of parameters that fall in the second category [1] . As a result, observational data, such as streamflow collected at the watershed outlet, are used to estimate the conceptual parameters through model calibration. Many watershed models, including the SWAT and PRMS models, can only achieve adequately accurate predictions after calibrating their parameters to available observations, making them less ideal for ungauged watersheds."}

{"text": "Corporations today collect their customers' private information to train Machine Learning models that power a variety of services like recommendations, searches, targeted ads, etc. To prevent any unintended use of personal data, privacy policies, such as the General Data Protection Regulation [14] (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act [6] (CCPA), require that these corporations provide the \"Right to be Forgotten\" (RTBF) to their usersif a user wishes to revoke access to their data, an organization must comply by erasing all information about her without undue delay (typically a month). Critically, models trained in standard ways are susceptible to model inversion [13] and membership inference attacks [31] , demonstrating that training data can be exfiltrated from these models.\nPeriodic retraining of models after excluding deleted users can be computationally expensive. Consequently, there is a growing interest in designing computationally cheap Machine Unlearning algorithms as an alternative to retraining for erasing the influence of deleted data from trained models. Since it is generally difficult to tell how a specific data point affects a model, Ginart et al. [15] propose quantifying the worst-case information leakage from an unlearned model through an unlearning guarantee on the mechanism, defined as a differential privacy (DP) like (ε, δ)-indistinguishability between its output and that of retraining on the updated database. With some minor variations in this definition, several mechanisms have been proposed and certified as unlearning algorithms in literature [15, 20, 30, 24, 17, 32] .\nHowever, is indistinguishability to retraining a sufficient guarantee of deletion privacy? We argue that it is not. In the real world, a user's decision to remove his information is often affected by what a deployed model reveals about him. Unfortunately, the same revealed information may also affect other users' decisions. Such adaptive requests make the records in a database interdependent. For instance, if an individual is identified to be part of the training set, many members of his group may request deletion. Therefore, the representation of different groups in the unlearned model can reveal the individual's affiliation, even when he is no longer part of the dataset. We demonstrate on mechanism certified under existing unlearning guarantees, including Gupta et al. [18] 's adaptive unlearning, that the identity of the target record can be inferred from the unlearned model when requests are adaptive. Since it is possible that adaptive deletion requests can encode patterns specific to a target record in the curator's database, we argue that any deletion privacy certification via indistinguishability to retraining, as done in all prior unlearning definitions, is fundamentally flawed.\nIs an unlearning guarantee a sound and complete measure of deletion privacy when requests are non-adaptive? Again, we argue that it is neither. A sound deletion privacy guarantee must ensure the non-recovery of deleted records from an infinite number of model releases after deletion. However, approximate indistinguishability to retraining implies an inability to accurately recover deleted data from a singular unlearned model only, which we argue is not sufficient. We show that certain algorithms can satisfy an unlearning guarantee yet blatantly reveal the deleted data eventually over multiple releases. The vulnerability arises in algorithms that maintain partial computations in internal data-dependent states for speeding up subsequent deletions. These internal states can retain information even after record deletion and influence multiple future releases, making the myopic unlearning guarantee unreliable in sequential deletion settings. Several proposed unlearning algorithms in literature [24, 18] are stateful (rely on internal states) and, therefore, cannot be trusted. Secondly, existing unlearning definitions are incomplete notions of deletion privacy they exclude valid deletion mechanisms that do not imitate retraining. For instance, a (useless) mechanism that outputs a fixed untrained model on any request is a valid deletion algorithm. However, since its output is easily distinguishable from retraining, it fails to satisfy these unlearning guarantees.\nThis paper proposes a sound definition of data-deletion that does not suffer from the aforementioned shortcomings. Under our paradigm, a data-deletion mechanism is reliable if A) it is stateless, i.e., does not rely on any secret states that may be influenced by previously deleted records; and B) it generates models that are indistinguishable from some deleted record independent random variable. Statelessness thwarts the danger of sustained information leakage through internal data structures after deletion. Moreover, by measuring its deletion privacy via indistinguishability with any deleted-record independent random variable, as opposed to the output of retraining, we ensure reliability in presence of adaptive requests that can create dependence between current and deleted records in the database.\nIn general, we show that under adaptive requests, any data-deletion mechanism must be privacy-preserving with respect to existing records to ensure the privacy of deleted records. Privacy with respect to existing records is necessary to prevent adaptive requests from creating any unwanted correlations among present and absent database entries that prevents deletion of records in an information theoretic sense. We also prove that if a mechanism is differentially private with respect to the existing records and satisfies our data-deletion guarantee under non-adaptive edit requests, then it also satisfies a data-deletion guarantee under adaptive requests. That is, we prove a general reduction for our sound data-deletion guarantee under non-adaptive requests to adaptive requests when the unlearning mechanism is differentially private with respect to records not being deleted. We emphasize that we are not advocating for doing data deletion through differentially-private mechanisms simply because it caps the information content of all records equally, deleted or otherwise. Instead, a data-deletion mechanism should provide two differing information reattainment bounds; one for records currently in the database in the form of a differential privacy guarantee, and the other for records previously deleted in the form of a non-adaptive data-deletion guarantee, as these two information bounds together ensure deletion privacy under adaptive requests as well.\nBased on our findings, we redefine the problem of data-deletion as designing a mechanism that (1.) satisfies a data-deletion guarantee against non-adaptive deletion requests, (2.) is differentially private for remaining records, and (3.) has the same utility guarantee as retraining under identical differential privacy constraints. On top of these objectives, a datadeletion mechanism must also be computationally cheaper than retraining for being useful. We propose a data-deletion solution based on Noisy Gradient Descent (Noisy-GD), a popular differentially private learning algorithm [3, 1] , and show that our solution satisfies all the three objectives while providing substantial computational savings for both convex and non-convex losses. Our solution demonstrates a powerful synergy between data deletion and differential privacy as the same noise needed for the privacy of records present in the database also rapidly erases information regarding records deleted from the database. For convex and smooth losses, we certify that under a (q, ε dd )-Rényi data-deletion and (q, ε dp )-Rényi DP constraint, our Noisy-GD based deletion mechanism for d-dimensional models over n-sized databases with requests that modify no more than r records can maintain a tight optimal excess empirical risk of the order O qd ε dp n 2 while being Ω(n log(min{ n r , n ε dd qd }) cheaper than retraining in gradient complexity."}

Coming in to bat at a tricky situation, Rahane smashed his 12th Test century on Sunday to give India firm control over Australia on the second Test\nIndia were bundled out for their lowest-ever Test score of 36 in the second innings as Australia claimed an eight-wicket win in the series opener at the Adelaide Oval. However, the tourists made a strong comeback in the ongoing second Test and are headed towards a dominant series-levelling win at the MCG on the back of stunning performances from Rahane, who scored a century in the first innings, and the bowlers.\n“I believe that this hundred is going to be one of the most important hundreds in the history of Indian cricket,” Gavaskar told the Seven Network.\nStand-in skipper, Rahane’s patient 112 paved the way for India taking a substantial 131-run first-innings lead against Australia, who were reduced to 133 for six by the end of the third days play on Monday.\nA stellar knock from #TeamIndia captain @ajinkyarahane88 comes to an end following an unfortunate run-out, his first in Test cricket. He returns after scoring a valiant 112. 👏🏾 Details – https://t.co/bG5EiYj0Kv pic.twitter.com/hDa5ULj7Le BCCI (@BCCI) December 28, 2020\nGavaskar said the valiant knock of Rahane sent out a message to the Australian camp that India will not ‘lie down and be walked all over’ despite the humiliating loss in the series opener.\n“Important because it’s showing character, sending a message to the opposition that after being dismissed for 36 in the previous game, to come back in this manner, this Indian team is not going to just lie down and be walked all over,” the former India captain said.\n“That is the message and that’s why I think this is going to be one of the most important hundreds in the history of Indian cricket,” Gavaskar added."}

{"text": "Prompt-tuning has become one of the most promising methods to adapting a pre-trained language model (PLM) to processing new downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks, particularly with only few input samples (Gu et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2022; Ye et al., 2022) . By freezing the PLM and training with a limited set of input samples, well-optimized few-shot prompttuning achieves a comparable performance to fullmodel fine-tuning, spanning a wide spectrum of PLM sizes and NLP tasks (Gu et al., 2022; Lester et al., 2021) . The success of prompt-tuning motivates adversaries to design prompt-based Trojan (a.k.a backdoor) attacks (Xu et al., 2022; Cai et al., 2022; Du et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2022; Mei et al., 2023; Xue et al., 2024) . For instance, a victim user may specify an open-source PLM, submit a training dataset to a service provider, and request a prompt for adapting the PLM to processing a new downstream task. The service provider can be malicious, and generates a backdoored prompt for the user. After receiving the backdoored prompt, the user may apply it to the PLM. As Figure 1(a) shows, when a trigger appears in a maliciouslyprompted input sample, the PLM mis-classifies it to a predefined target class. Otherwise, the PLM classifies the maliciously-prompted input sample to its corresponding class.\nUnfortunately, prior prompt-based backdoors (Xu et al., 2022; Cai et al., 2022; Du et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2022; Mei et al., 2023) cannot be implemented by few-shot prompt-tuning. Prior prompt-based backdoors require either a full-model fine-tuning (Xu et al., 2022; Mei et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2022) or a large training dataset (Du et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2022) . In order to achieve a high attack success rate (ASR), BToP (Xu et al., 2022) , Notable (Mei et al., 2023) , and BadPrompt (Cai et al., 2022) have to modify a nontrivial number of PLM parameters, making their backdoor designs less stealthy and vulnerable to existing backdoor detection techniques (Feng et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2023b) . Although the other prompt-based backdoor designs including PPT (Du et al., 2022) and PromptAttack (Shi et al., 2022) keep the PLM clean, and tune only a small number of prompt parameters, they require hundreds of input samples to produce a backdoored prompt that can obtain a high ASR. DecodingTrust (Wang et al., 2023) evaluates the effectiveness of attacks using hand-crafted, engineered prompts on GPT models. However, it does not address scenarios involving prompt-tuning."}
{"text": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful machine learning models that can learn complex patterns from data. However, their complexity can make it difficult to understand why a DNN makes a particular prediction purely from their mathematical construction. We build upon the prior Explainable AI (XAI) work from Virani et al. 1 (see Figure 1 ) which effectively explains if there is proper training data to support the decisions. However, their memory and computational footprint prevents the approach from being effective for very large data sets and on edge devices. We exploit the concept of Sparse Gaussian processes [2] [3] [4] [5] to overcome these two computational challenges while maintaining the their method's accuracy and explainability. Our approach is a computationally efficient XAI method that extracts example-based justifications and uncertainty estimates that can be applied to any pre-trained DNN.\nExplainable artificial intelligence addresses the black-box problem in many ways: it decomposes the model construction for more intuitive human understanding; it supplements models with tools that explain their decision-making; or a structured combination of the previous two. By providing insights into how AI systems make decisions, XAI can help humans to identify and correct potential errors before they cause harm. As such, XAI is a critical tool for ensuring the safety and human trust in mission-critical tasks such as jet engine maintenance and airport safety. In the context of jet engine maintenance, XAI can be used to provide detailed reasoning about the evidence suggesting potential problems before they can cause failures, recommend corrective actions to prevent potential issues, and monitor the performance of engines to ensure that they continue to operate safely. In the context of airport safety, XAI can be used to detect and explain potential hazards on the airport grounds, expedite human understanding of the evidence behind security threats, and monitor the movement of aircraft to ensure that they follow safe takeoff and landing directions.\nWhile there are a number of competing standards and meta-studies of XAI, 6 primary seminal papers explore XAI using one of three main approaches. The first approach is to use gradient-based methods to identify the input features that are most important for a particular prediction. 7 This can be done by calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to the input features -the features with the largest gradients are the ones that have the most influence on the prediction. The second approach to explainability is to train the DNN to output text that explains its reasoning. This can be done by using a technique called attention, which allows the DNN to focus on specific input features when making a prediction."}

{"text": "With the emergence of deep learning there has been rising concern about the opacity of Artifical Intelligence (AI) systems and their impact on public and private life [Adadi and Berrada, 2018; Guidotti et al., 2018] . Currently, governments are taking steps to protect people's rights, to regulate the AI industry and ensure that these technologies are not abused (e.g., the EU's GDPR [Goodman and Flaxman, 2017] ). Research on eXplainable AI (XAI) tries to address such issues using automated explanations to improve the transparency of black-box models, to audit datasets and ensure fairness, accountability and trustworthiness [Gunning and Aha, 2019; Sokol and Flach, 2019; Birhane et al., 2022] .\nRecently, significant research effort have been expended on counterfactual explanations for XAI [Byrne, 2019; Miller, 2019; Keane et al., 2021; Karimi et al., 2022] ; a recent survey paper reports 350 papers on the topic [Verma et al., 2022] . In this paper, we survey a less-researched special-case of the counterfactual, semi-factual explanations. In this review, we survey the literature on semi-factuals, we define desiderata for this strategy, identify key evaluation metrics and implement baselines to provide a solid base for future work.\nCounterfactuals aim to explain algorithmic decisions in a post-hoc fashion, as an after-the-fact justification. So, in XAI, counterfactuals are typically used to explain what changes to the input-features of an AI system will change the outputdecision. For example, when a customer is refused a loan (i.e., the negative-class outcome for Q in Fig. 1 ), the counterfactual might say \"if you asked for a loan with a shorter term, it would have been approved\" (the red C in Fig. 1 that has a positive-class outcome). Technically, these could be called \"outcome-counterfactuals\" as they capture changes to the world that change the outcome (here, to be consistent with the literature, we will mostly call them \"counterfactuals\").\nSemi-factuals are a special-case of the counterfactual; they differ from outcome-counterfactuals in that they show endusers the feature changes that do not change a decisionoutcome."}

The cars will help the driver to avoid texting while driving. The manufacturers will lessen the texting while driving issues by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays, helping the driver pay more attention to the road and things happening around them. The driver will be more aware of what is happening on the roads, rather than paying attention to cell phones.\r\n\r\nThe development of these cars will also prevent accidents. Google's Toyota Prius, for example, uses a spinning sensor on the roof. The sensor uses laser beams to make a constantly updating 3-D model of everything around the car. This can help the driver be aware of things surrounding their automobile, such as other cars, animals, or pedestrians.

{"text": "AI systems are typically trained to maximize a pre-specified objective but, for many tasks, defining an objective that fully captures the intentions of the designer is prohibitively difficult. One promising alternative to manually specifying objectives is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In RLHF, human teachers compare pairs of trajectories against each other, the comparisons are used to train a reward model, and the reward model provides reward signal to further train the reinforcement learning agent [1] [2] [3] . RLHF has proven effective for training models on tasks that require human judgement, including summarizing texts and promoting helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in large language models [4] [5] [6] [7] .\nRLHF methods assume all human feedback comes from a single human teacher. However, these methods typically require querying many teachers to gather sufficient training data, and all teachers are not equal -they vary in their ability to evaluate system behavior. For example, Ziegler et al. [8] finds that crowd sourced feedback often disagrees with the paper authors' feedback. An individual teacher's ability can also vary across queries. For example, Stiennon et al. [4] trains human teachers at different summarization domains, producing evaluators that \"specialize\" in evaluating either Reddit or CNN summaries. In the future, we expect RLHF to be applied to increasingly complex and compound tasks, where evaluators vary in their expertise across task components. RLHF methods may need to actively select teachers based on their expertise to ensure reliable feedback on different tasks. We call the problem of learning from multiple, specialized teachers the expertise problem.\nOur contributions are as follows. We propose an abstract problem formulation of the expertise problem. Under this formulation, we test PEBBLE [2] , a state of the art RLHF algorithm. We find that naive extensions of PEBBLE perform poorly, but that simple modifications, including selecting the most expert teacher and making intra-domain queries, can significantly improve performance. Our key contribution is to formalize and characterize the expertise problem, and to demonstrate the insufficiency of current methods. We hope that this formalism, demonstration, and open-source implementation will pave the way for more advanced RLHF methods that are robust to teacher variance and specialization. \n= ((s 1 , a 1 ), ..., (s k , a k )) ∈ (S × A) k .\nIn RLHF, these trajectories are presented to human teachers as binary comparisons (σ 1 , σ 2 ), and teachers select which trajectory they prefer [1, 2] ."}

{"text": "In the previous works on adapting moving frames to obrain the numerical solution of PDEs on curved surfaces such as conservational laws [1] , diffusion equation [2] , shallow water equations [3] , and Maxwell's equations [4] , the direction of the moving frames is given at random on the tangent plane in the absence of anisotropy. Because the first moving frames, denoted as e 1 , should be differentiable within each element, the direction of moving frames cannot be independent of the direction of neighboring moving frames to ensure differentiability. However, their average direction is still random. Let us call this type of distribution as moving frames of order zero according to the Cartan's original definitions [5] . In this case, moving frames are nothing more than an orthonormal local reference reflecting the geometry of the tangent plane.\nThe moving frames of first order are naturally obtained by aligning e 1 in the direction of the tangent vector along the trajectory of a wave. In Maxwell's equations, for example, the first moving frame e 1 is in the same direction as the electric or magnetic field, and in the diffusion-reaction equation, it is in the same direction as the gradient of the variable that represents an electric potential or material concentration. The moving frames of second order and moving frames of third order are obtained by additionally aligning e 2 and e 3 in the binormal and normal directions, respectively."}

{"text": "Over the past few decades, there has been a significant increase in efforts to develop efficient uncertainty quantification approaches for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with random inputs. Typically, these random inputs arise from a lack of precise measurements or a limited understanding of realistic model parameters, such as permeability coefficients in diffusion problems and refraction coefficients in acoustic problems [38, 11, 12] .\nDesigning a surrogate model or calculating statistics (such as mean and variance of the solution) for partial differential equations (PDEs) with random inputs is of great interest, especially when the inputs are high-dimensional. To achieve this, extensive efforts have been made. The Monte Carlo method (MCM) and its variants are among the direct methods for computing the mean and variance [5, 13] . In MCM, numerous sample points of the random inputs are generated based on their probability density functions. For each sample point, the corresponding deterministic problem can be solved using existing numerical methods. The statistics of the stochastic solution can then be estimated by aggregating the results of these deterministic solutions. While MCM is easy to implement, it converges slowly and typically requires a large number of sample points. Additionally, it does not provide a surrogate model directly, which limits its applications.\nTo enhance efficiency, the stochastic collocation method (SCM) and the stochastic Galerkin method (SGM) have been developed. Both the SCM and the SGM are typically more efficient than the MCM for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with moderate dimensional random inputs [37, 38, 39, 40, 32, 41] . To further accelerate the SCM and the SGM, various of methods such as the reduced basis collocation method [10] , the dynamically orthogonal approximation [6, 7, 24] , the reduced basis solver based on low-rank approximation [27] and the preconditioned low-rank projection methods [19, 20] are actively studied."}
{"text": "As social networks become integrated into people's daily routines, there is a prevalent occurrence of program-controlled bots masquerading as legitimate users for malicious purposes [Subrahmanian et al., 2016] . Social bots engage in detrimental activities such as propagating misinformation [Varol et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2023] , manipulating public opinion [Cui et al., 2020] , interfering in elections [Rossi et al., 2020] and promoting extremist ideologies [Ferrara et al., 2016] . It is therefore imperative to effectively detect social \nT T T ••• ••• ••• •••\nFigure 1 : Dynamic nature of social network bots to mitigate the detrimental societal and economic impact and to preserve the integrity of social network information.\nTraditional techniques for bot detection are largely based on features, requiring extraction of either numerical feature from user information [Yang et al., 2013] or semantic features from textual information [Wei and Nguyen, 2019; Dukić et al., 2020] . However, bot operators can often bypass bot detection through advanced countermeasures, which is commonly referred to as bot evolution [Cresci, 2020] . In fact, the detectability of the feature-based methods is vulnerable to imitation and evasion, as bot operators can effortlessly steal user information from legitimate users or intersperse a few malicious messages with many neutral ones [Feng et al., 2022b] . As a result, such methods are inaccurate in spotting disguised social bots. With the advancements in graph neural networks, some researchers employed graph-based methods [Wu et al., 2023; Feng et al., 2022a; Yang et al., 2023a] to identify the disguised social bots. They typically assume that the network structure of social bots generally differs from that of legitimate users. For instance, social bots tend to have sparser connections and randomly select users to interact with, whereas human beings prefer to connect with others who share similar characteristics [Yang et al., 2013] . These graph-based methods are among top performers by leveraging the topological structure of social networks for bot detection. However, most of the existing graph-based detection methods interpret the social network as a static graph and fail to acquire the dynamic nature of social networks. As shown in Figure 1 , there still remain two intractable issues:\nDeficiency in utilizing historical interaction graph context. Similar to the case of evading detection from featurebased methods by forging numerical or semantic features, the ever-evolving social bots are meticulously engineered to interact with legitimate users and mimic their network structures [Cresci, 2020] to escape graph-based detection. However, despite the structure of social network has changed, the discrepancies in the previous interaction graph between social bots and benign users could reveal the deception of social bots and uncover their true identity. Unfortunately, conventional approaches upon static graphs solely rely on the last state of the social network and overlook the valuable historical interaction graph context. Consequently, if the social bots have already completed their disguise, it is challenging for static graph based methods to distinguish benign users from the evolved social bots.\nLimitation of modeling evolving behavior patterns. Social bots evolve over time, evading detection by dynamically adapting their actions, strategies, or interaction patterns to mimic legitimate users. In contrast, genuine users do not require such adaptations and exhibit different evolution of behavior patterns compared to social bots. Discovering the evolving behavior patterns may enhance the effectiveness of social network modeling [Liu et al., 2020] ."}

Desde el arroyo de Totalán hasta el de Santillán hay algo más de siete kilómetros de cuidadas y equipadas playas. Pero a un paso de estos arenales aguarda también un importante patrimonio histórico y natural, que bien conocen quienes tienen esta localidad como destino estival.\nCuevas prehistóricas, torres vigías medievales y una fortaleza del siglo XVIII conforman un valioso legado que no debe pasar desapercibido ni siquiera en verano.\nLo que hoy es una costa turística como otros enclaves urbanos marengos ha sido a lo largo de la historia uno de los enclaves litorales más codiciado por su valor estratégico. Así se comprueba con la existencia en su territorio de un par de torres vigías y un recinto amurallado que hacen Rincón de la Victoria merecedor de formar parte de la conocida como Ruta de las Torres Vigías de la Axarquía.\nEntre sus dos almenaras, la más occidental es la que se levanta en El Cantal, una llamativa formación rocosa bañada por el Mediterráneo. Esta atalaya, como ocurría hace siglos, permite tener una visión amplia de la costa.\nEn la zona oriental de su término municipal se encuentra la Torre de Benagalbón, que da nombre a uno de los núcleos urbanos. Tanto ésta como la del Cantal fueron levantadas originalmente en el siglo XIV por los árabes, aunque fueron reconstruidas posteriormente por los Reyes Católicos.\nEntre ambas torres, como complemento al sistema de vigilancia, se puede visitar la Casa Fuerte de Bezmiliana. Este recinto amurallado, que actualmente alberga una sala de exposiciones, tiene una muralla con dos garitas, desde donde se oteaba la línea marítima para evitar posibles ataques de piratas.\nOtro gran aliciente para visitar Rincón de la Victoria es su célebre Cueva del Tesoro que fue habitada por el hombre prehistórico. Está considerada una joya de la geología por ser la única cavidad de origen marino de Europa. De hecho, la acción del Mediterráneo ha sido la que ha contribuido durante milenios –desde el Jurásico–, con su efecto erosivo, a la formación tanto de esta cueva como de otras situadas bajo el denominado Cantal.\nEn su interior se encontraron a través de distintas excavaciones numerosos restos humanos, animales y de cerámica de la época conocida como el 'Neolítico de las Cuevas'. Entre sus salas más importantes, sobresale la de la Virgen, la del Volcán, la de Marco Craso y la de Noctiluca.

For instance, general update policies such as zerowait policy have been studied in [3] , where an efficient optimal update mechanism has been designed.

The authors mainly concentrated on the system performance under M/M/1 and M/M/1/2 queuing systems with first-come-first-served (FCFS) policies. Poisson arrival processes with last-generated-firstserved (LGFS) strategy have been considered in [5] , as an extension from the last-come-first-served (LCFS) system. The limited nature of the transmission power or the total energy in communication systems has necessitated the age minimization problems to be addressed under energy constraints.

The authors in [7] have considered an optimal sensing scheduling policy for energy harvesting sensing system and discussed the system performance with finite and infinite battery sizes separately. Also, the performance of the proposed policy was shown to match the theoretical bounds. The integer battery policies were generalized in [8] , and the threshold polices have been characterized."}

{"text": "Former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe is suing the FBI and the Department of Justice (DOJ), alleging they refused to provide him with documents related to his firing. Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe in March, just two days before he was set to retire.\nThe complaint says the DOJ has publicly defended the firing yet failed to identify for McCabe the policies and procedures it followed before dismissing him. The department has withheld the information, McCabe's lawyers allege, for fear that the materials could be used against them in any additional lawsuits.\n\"We don't create or adjudicate under secret law or procedure,\" David Snyder, one of McCabe's lawyers, said in an email to The Associated Press.\nThe case pits the career law enforcement official against a Justice Department that employed him for more than two decades. It refocuses attention on a firing last March that divided current and former DOJ officials. And it signals that McCabe, repeatedly targeted for criticism and attacks by President Trump in the last year, is determined to try to clear his name in court even as he faces a possible criminal probe into whether he intentionally misled internal investigators.\nThe lawsuit in federal court in Washington also comes just days ahead of a Justice Department inspector general report expected to criticize senior FBI officials, including McCabe, for their actions during the Hillary Clinton email investigation.\nMcCabe's lawyers say in the complaint that they want the records as they \"seek to vindicate Mr. McCabe's rights and restore his good name,\" and as they weigh whether to take more legal action over a firing they contend was improper. The case names as defendants the Justice Department, the FBI and the inspector general's office.\nA spokeswoman for DOJ declined to comment Tuesday evening, and a spokesman for the watchdog office did not immediately return messages seeking comment.\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe on March 16, less than two days before his scheduled retirement, on the recommendation of FBI and DOJ officials. McCabe, who joined the FBI in 1996 and was named to the No. 2 position 20 years later, became the bureau's acting leader following the firing in May 2017 of James Comey as director.\nThe termination followed allegations that McCabe had misled disciplinary officials and Comey, his then-boss, about his role in authorizing FBI officials to speak with a Wall Street Journal reporter for an October 2016 story about an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation.\nThe inspector general's office concluded in a report earlier this year that McCabe had repeatedly deceived investigators and referred the matter for potential criminal prosecution to the U.S. attorney's office in Washington. McCabe has denied the allegations, and has said that when he thought his answers were being misunderstood during interviews with investigators, he tried to correct the record.\nIn the lawsuit, McCabe's lawyers say the department has repeatedly insisted that it followed appropriate policies and procedures before firing McCabe but has either denied or refused to respond to multiple requests about that process.\n\"Defendants fear that disclosure to Plaintiff of the documents at issue will place Defendants and others at risk in any proceedings brought against them by Mr. McCabe,\" the complaint states. \"Based on these fears, Defendants appear to have preemptively decided not to disclose the documents to Plaintiff.\"\nAmong the records being sought are an inspector general manual that lays out the guidelines governing the office and FBI policy guides on how disciplinary matters should be handled.\nThe lawsuit says the inspector general's office refused to make the manual available for public review and denied multiple requests to provide it, and also denied the lawyers access to a library or reading room where the materials could have been reviewed."}
{"text": "Is the use of a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System valuable to read the emotional expressions of sudents in a classroom?. In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'alto, the author describes how a new technolgy called the Facial Action Coding System enables computer to identify human emotions. It is a new software that has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others, and, has promissing applications for a variety of industries. The use of this new technology is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because it recognizes whether a sudent is boring or confused, it detects 6 basic emotions and even mixed and it hepls the person not only to express the emotions but to produce them.\r\n\r\nSchool brings a lot of emotions to the students, they might be good or bad feelings. But the most common feelings seen by the techers are boredom, and confusion from the students, sometimes the teachers are not able to identify those emotions, since students just might fake a smile and the teacher will be satisfied that the student is doing just fine or thewy might be confused but afraid to speak up so they just sit there like everything is just normal. So, how might the teacher be able to identify these emotions? The Facial Action Coding System has the answer. In the passage it states \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored\". It also states \"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective e human instructor\". By this evidence , the author tries to persuade the reader to get more into this new technology and how it is just not a software but a valuable thing. With this technology it would be easier for the teacher to identify when one or more students are bored; this would allow them to think throught about changing a new method to teach so the studetns don't get bored in class. It also helps them to notify when a student is confused on a topic, so the teacher would be able to take the necessary time to explain and explain until the student is able to understand the new topic learned. The mayority of students nowdays don't care about school or just don't get the new topic learned, but teachers try their best to help them, but they think everything is just fine, so they don't bother on asking or trying harder. Communication is the key to success but they don't implement it, so what is best than a new tehnology to help out a little.\r\n\r\nThere are 6 basic emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and there are even people that have not only one but two mixed emotions at the same time.. Wouldn't it be great to be able to recognize when a person is having these emotions?. This new technology is here to help. In the passage it states \"Eckman has classified six basic emotions... and then associated with characteristic movements of the facial muscles\". It also states \"The software can even identify mixed emotions (as in Da Vinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face(showing no emotion)\"."}
{"text": "This article is going to change the world toady as we know. If we allow our computers to identify human emotions, its a whole new way to look at life. People will be able to get what the want when they want because their computer will know when they are happy or mad at something. For instance, if you are online shopping and your face seems disgusted by a bright yellow shirt, the computer will see your expression and change the shirt to a blue one. By having that change be done for you, people will instantly become happier and have what they want right in front of them.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this new use of technolgy could be very helpful for many people. In the essay, it states the percent of emotions that the painting of Mona Lisa is. No one could ever be that spot on, so with the Facial Action Coding System, we now have the precise percents of what Mona Lisa's emotions are. By having these percents, we now have a blast to the past to think about what Leonardo da Vinci was thinking while painting this portrait. Maybe the reason she was mostly happy is because he was a genuinely happy person. It opens up a whole new door to what we can study and research. Since no one from back then is still alive today, this is our way of finding out not only what he was doing, but better yet what he was thinking! There is not a single machine that can do that today, so having this device would be a game changer.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Facial Action Coding System would be an amazing new technology to have, many people could disagree with the system. Since having this system means that something, or even someone, is always watching you, people could feel that it is an invasion of personal space."}

{"text": "The selectivity of a selection query on a set of objects in a database is the probability of a random object in the database satisfying the query predicate. A key step in query optimization, selectivity estimation is used by databases for estimating costs of alternative query processing plans and picking the best one. Consequently, selectivity estimation has been studied extensively in the last few decades [30, 35, 42, 43, 45] . Historically, selectivity estimation has been data-driven. These approaches construct, or dynamically maintain, a small-size synopsis of the data distribution using histograms or random samples that minimize estimation error. While these methods work well in low dimensions, they suffer from the curse of dimensionality. As a result, interest in learning-based methods for selectivity estimation has been growing over the years [23, 31, 32, 33, 37, 39] . Many different methods have been proposed that work with the data distribution, observed selectivities from query workloads, or a combination of both. At a high-level, many of these techniques build a model of the underlying data distribution and use it to answer queries. While they work very well in practice, often outperforming their traditional counterparts, a theoretical understanding of this line of work is missing. This leads to the natural question, whether selectivity can be learned efficiently from a small sample of query selectivities alone, without access to the data distribution. Hu et al. [26] formalize the learnability of the selectivity estimation problem in this setting. They use the agnostic-learning framework [24] , an extension of the classical PAC learning framework for real-valued functions, where one is given a set of sample queries from a fixed query distribution and their respective selectivities (the training set), and the goal is to efficiently construct a data distribution so that the selectivity of a new query from the same query distribution can be answered with high accuracy. They show that for a wide class of range queries, the selectivity query can be learned within error ε ∈ (0, 1) with probability at least 1 -δ using a training set of size ε -O(1) log δ -1 , where the exponent of ε depends on the query type; see [26] for a precise statement of their results. Informally, learnability implies that performance of a model on the training set generalizes to unseen queries from the same distribution. This reduces the task of learning to finding a (model of the) data distribution that best fits the training data i.e. Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). Although Hu et al. [26] prove a sharp bound on the sample complexity, their algorithm for ERM takes prohibitively long and produces a data distribution of large size. They also present fast heuristics to construct small-size data distributions, but they do not provide any guarantee on the performance with respect to the best data distribution fitting the training set. This raises the question of how to develop a provably efficient and effective algorithm for constructing the best data distribution (in a given family) from a training set.\nNote that the size of the distribution computed by [26] , can further be reduced to O(ε -2 ) by choosing an ε-approximation, with an increase of ε in the error; see [22] and Section 3 below."}

However, the SAN does you no good for finding actual information due to the effects of VM and application sprawl on your data organization.\nNow the millennials want to deploy MongoDB because it’s “webscale.\" The Hadoop vendor is knocking and wants to build a data lake, which is supposed to magically produce insights by using cheaper storage ... and produce yet another storage technology to worry about.\nTime to stop the madness! This is the year you wrangle your data and make it work for your organization instead of your organization working for its data. How do you get your data straight? Start with these 12 New Year’s resolutions:\n1. Catalog where the data is\nYou need to know what you have. Whether or not this takes the form of a complicated data mapping and management system isn’t as important as the actual concerted effort to find it.\n2. Map data use\nYour data is in use by existing applications, and there’s an overall flow throughout the organization. Whether you track this “data lineage” and “data dependency” via software or sweat, you need to know why you’re keeping this stuff, as well as who’s using it and why. What is the data? What is the source system for each piece of data? What is it used for?\n3. Understand how data is created\nRemember the solid fuel booster at NASA that had a 1-in-300-year failure rate? Remember that the number was pretty much pulled out of the air? Most of the data was on paper and passed around. How is your data created? How are the numbers derived? This is probably an ongoing effort, as there are new sources of data every day, but it’s worthwhile to prevent your organization’s own avoidable and repeated disasters.\n4. Understand how data flows through the organization\nKnowing how data is used is critical, but you also need to understand how it got there and any transformation it underwent. You need a map of your organization’s data circulatory system, the big form of the good old data flow diagram. This will not only let you find “black holes” (where inputs are used but no results happen) and “miracles” (where a series of insufficient inputs can’t possibly produce the expected result), but also where redundant flows and transformations exist. Many organizations have lots of copies of the same stuff produced by very similar processes that differ by technology stack alone. It’s just data—we don’t have to pledge allegiance to the latest platform in our ETL process.\n5. Automate manual data processing\nAt various times I’ve tried to sneak a post past my editor entitled something like “Ban Microsoft Excel!” (I think may have worked that into a post or two.)"}

{"text": "Images have been getting increasingly larger over the past decade. Images captured by consumer cameras on smartphones now capture images at 4K resolution (roughly 8.3M pixels) while professional DSLR cameras capture images at 8K resolution. Elsewhere, sensors on satellites and microscopes capture images with over a billion pixels.\nModern computer vision pipelines are limited by the memory in the systems they are trained upon, resulting in the creation of models that only operate on small images.\nComputer vision practitioners limit the size of images in two less-than-ideal ways: down-sampling or cropping. While these simple operations produce powerful models when measured against typical computer vision benchmarks, the loss of high frequency information or global context is limited for many real-world tasks. Consider a video feed of a football game. Captured natively in 8K resolution, a model attempting to answer the question of where a player on the left side of the screen will pass the ball to on the right side of screen will not be able to reason over the entire image in one pass. The image, the downstream model, and all intermediate tensors cannot fit in the memory of modern, large VRAM GPUs. A common approach is to process the image by treating it as individual \"windows\", each fed through the model without sharing context, resulting in sub-optimal performance.\nWe introduce xT, a framework by which myopic vision backbones can effectively integrate local and global context over large images. In particular,we tackle both issues of quadratically-increasing GPU memory utilization and the integration of context across very large images. We achieve this by improving the strengths of hierarchical vision backbones [21, 30] through nested tokenization of images and processing resulting features with long-sequence models, The key is our nested tokenization of large images at multiple levels: at the region level as input R 0 , . . . , R 8 (R, . . . , R + 8 for readability) for the region encoders, and then at the patch level R i 0 , . . . , R i P -1 inside the encoders to understand local details. The image regions then undergo independent, hierarchical encoding, by passing through a vision backbone that serves as a region encoder. Hierarchical region encoders result in down-sampled features which, when combined with context encoders, allows us to process more regions at once than typically possible. One such context encoder, Transformer-XL, is illustrated in Stage 2. It recurrently processes previous prior sequence tokens using cross attention, extending its context range significantly with depth. The resulting sequence has assimilated both local and global context and is finally fed to a task-specific decoder."}

{"text": "In the assignment problem (Hylland & Zeckhauser, 1979; Zhou, 1990) , n agents have unit demands and strict ordinal preferences for n items, each with unit supply, and the goal is to compute an assignment which allocates each agent with one unit of items and (approximately) maximizes agent satisfaction. This serves as a useful model for a variety of problems involving houses (Shapley & Scarf, 1974) , dormitory rooms (Chen & Sönmez, 2002) , school choice without priorities (Miralles, 2009) , and computational resources in cloud computing (Ghodsi et al., 2011 (Ghodsi et al., , 2012;; Grandl et al., 2014) . Due to the wide applicability of the assignment problem, there is a rich literature pursuing the design of assignment mechanisms satisfying desirable properties of efficiency, fairness, and strategyproofness. However, many of these properties are incompatible with each other, and trade-offs must be made.\nIn several practical assignment problems, whether a maximal number of agents are allocated their respective top items, or first-choice maximality (FCM), is identified as an important measure of agents' satisfaction with an assignment. For example, in school choice programs, the percentage of students admitted to their most preferred school is often prominently reported in mass media as a measure of student welfare, and is therefore also an important consideration for school administrators (Dur et al., 2018) . Often, additional efficiency guarantees are also desired such as Pareto-efficiency (PE), which requires that an assignment cannot be improved upon so that some agents are better off and no agent is worse off. In light of these considerations, we seek to address the following question in this paper: Can we design mechanisms that satisfy important efficiency criteria (such as FCM and PE simultaneously), while also providing desirable fairness and strategyproofness guarantees?\nThe desire for efficiency has motivated the design of mechanisms that (approximately) maximize total satisfaction by a natural heuristic which seeks to allocate each item to an agent who ranks it as highly as possible. A prominent example of this is the famous Boston mechanism, which proceeds iteratively by allocating as many items as possible to agents who rank it as their first choice, then allocating as many items as possible to agents who rank the items in second position, and so on."}

{"text": "Esta semana comienzan en España los ensayos de fase II de la vacuna contra la COVID-19 de Janssen, el laboratorio de la farmacéutica estadounidense Johnson&Johnson. Será en los hospitales La Paz, La Princesa (Madrid) y Marqués de Valdecilla (Santander), y fue el anuncio que hizo el Gobierno el pasado 28 de agosto tras la autorización de la Agencia Española de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios (AEMPS). Los responsables han dedicado estos 15 días a reclutar a los voluntarios y a seleccionar entre ellos a quienes eran adecuados y quienes no. Entre medias, el efecto de la interrupción durante una semana de la avanzada vacuna de la Universidad de Oxford por una posible reacción adversa en una voluntaria ha recorrido el mundo. También España, donde la noticia ha multiplicado las dudas en algunos posibles voluntarios, sobre todo entre los más mayores, según algunos responsables de las pruebas.\nLa fase 2 en España –se prueba también en Alemania y Países Bajos– de la vacuna de Janssen, llamada Ad26.COV2.S, requiere un total de 190 participantes, 75 en cada uno de los dos centros madrileños y 40 en el cántabro. Esta es una alternativa si la de AstraZeneca (el laboratorio de Oxford) finalmente saliera mal, pues es una de las otras cinco para las que la Unión Europea ha preacordado una compra, aunque ambas partes siguen en negociaciones para concretarla. Los responsables esperan que esta fase esté concluida en unos 14 meses, aunque los resultados estarán en unos cinco y paralelamente podrá comenzar la fase 3. Una portavoz de Johnson&Johnson explica que ahora mismo \"no disponen de plazos fijos\" y depende de cómo evolucione la fase en cada centro, y avisan de que \"muchas veces el proceso puede interrumpirse y luego retomarse, por ejemplo porque algún voluntario tenga alguna gripe y haya que analizarlo, por lo que sea\". Es decir, como ha ocurrido en Oxford.\nLas edades de los participantes en España se han dividido en dos franjas, los de 18 a 55 y los mayores de 65. Las vacunaciones comienzan en La Paz y La Princesa este martes, en Marqués de Valdecilla lo han hecho el lunes. El investigador Alberto Borobia, coordinador de la operación en La Paz, explica que no ha habido problema para conseguir a los más jóvenes. Solo en su hospital han tenido unas 200 candidaturas para las 50 que necesitaban y cuentan con unos 40 en reserva por si alguien falla, \"aunque una vez que se empieza a vacunar, son los que son\".\nEntre los mayores de 65 todavía están pendientes de completar el grupo de 25 que esperan reunir. Tienen confirmados a algo más de la mitad y seguirán cerrando consentimientos hasta el fin de semana. Se debe a que \"hemos tenido a mucha gente que no cumplía con los criterios de inclusión. Y también ha habido gente que se presentó que al final se ha retirado\". El primer criterio de inclusión, para todos los participantes, ha sido no haber pasado ni estar pasando actualmente la infección por SARS-CoV-2, por lo que hasta esta misma semana se siguen haciendo PCR y test serológicos, porque \"hay que hacerlos justo antes o pierden validez\"."}

{"text": "The Bi-encoder (Karpukhin et al., 2020) is a type of neural network architecture that is widely used in information retrieval. It consists of two encoders, typically in the form of transformer models (Vaswani et al., 2017) , which encode an vector representation for user queries and potential documents or passages respectively. These two encoders can be shared or using two separate models. The similarity between these two embedding vectors can then be computed, often using dot product or cosine similarity, to determine the relevance of the document or passage to the user's query.\nCross-encoders (Nogueira and Cho, 2019) , unlike bi-encoders, amalgamate the inputs at an early stage, allowing for a more intricate interaction between user queries and documents. Here the user query and the document are concatenated, based on which a joint embedding vector is computed. The joint embedding vector is then used to make predictions, such as the relevance of a document to a query in an information retrieval task. Crossencoders often outperform bi-encoders in tasks re-Figure 1 : Overall view on LLM-augmented retrieval framework. Synthetic relevant queries and synthetic titles are generated from LLM and then assembled into doc-level embedding together with chunks (passages) split from the original document. The final retrieval is based on the similarity between user query and the doc-level embedding.\nquiring a nuanced understanding of the interplay between inputs.\nLate-interaction models, such as ColBERT (Khattab and Zaharia, 2020), ColBERTv2 (Santhanam et al., 2021) or SPALDE++ (Formal et al., 2022) , are model architectures that hybrids crossencoder models and bi-encoder models. Queries and documents are independently encoded into token-level vector representations. So in some sense, this is a bag of embedding vectors model. The interaction between these representations, which constitutes the \"late interaction\", involves computing the cosine similarity or dot product scores over the token-level vector embedding.\nAll the model architectures require informative embedding of user queries and target documents."}

{"text": "In 1979, in his paper on secret sharing [30] , A. Shamir presented the following threshold problem introduced by C. L. Liu in [20, : Eleven scientists are working on a secret project. They wish to lock up the documents in a cabinet so that 1. As a warm up, we relax Liu and Shamir's assumption and design a physical k-out-of-n threshold padlock system. We have build a prototype of this physical device. Our system only requires one padlock and one key per participant, which is practical, when compared to the previous exponential solution.\n2. Then, we establish lower bounds on the number of padlocks necessary for any abstract threshold system.\nSpecifically, we show that for a 2-out-of-n configuration, less than 2 log 2 (n) padlocks are sufficient, provided that keys can be duplicated. In fact, there is an optimal solution for this type of configuration, with O(log(n)) padlocks, and we also show that this optimum can be realized, using our physical system as one building block.\nDifferently, for k-out-of-n configurations with k ≥ 3, it is more complicated to solve the problem with fewer than n padlocks. We first prove that this is impossible for k ≥ √ 2n and thus that our physical device is optimal in these cases. For instance, this answers Liu's question: the minimal number of padlocks for a 6-out-of-11 configuration is 11, as 6 > √ 22. Our system with 11 padlocks and only 1 key per participant, is thus optimal in this case. We are then nonetheless able to give algorithms building systems for k = 3 with only about 2.5\n√ n padlocks and each participant owns 3 keys. These realizations use more complex access structures and associated algorithmic building blocks, that we provide. 3. We discuss more complex access structures, which include for instance ensuring that Alice and Bob can open the lock with any other third participant, but not together. Another possibility is for instance that Alice is highly ranked and can open the padlock by herself but that any others need to be at least two. For this we develop a tentative padlock algebra for logic gates and give associated algorithms."}

Nowadays, deep neural network models are frequently being deployed into real-world systems. However, recent work (Guo, Pleiss, Sun, & Weinberger, 2017) pointed out that those highly accurate, negative-log-likelihood (NLL) trained deep neural networks are poorly calibrated (Niculescu-Mizil & Caruana, 2005) , i.e., the model predicted class probabilities do not faithfully estimate the true correctness likelihood and lead to overconfident and underconfident predictions. Deploying uncalibrated models into real-world systems is at high risk, particularly for safety-critical applications such as medical diagnosis (Caruana, Lou, Gehrke, Koch, Sturm, & Elhadad, 2015) , autonomous driving (Bojarski, Del Testa, Dworakowski, Firner, Flepp, Goyal, Jackel, Monfort, Muller, Zhang, et al., 2016) and finance decision-making.\nCalibrating deep models is a procedure for preventing the model's posterior distribution from being over-or under-confident.

The author also explains how we could explore our sister-planet, Venus in a couple ways and tries to put it into perspective for us.\r\n\r\nThe author starts with talking about previous missions to reach Venus that ended unsuccessful due to Its harsh surface and atmosphere. The atmosphere of Venus is almost 97% carbon dioxide and to add onto that the clouds carry highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Making it difficult already to get a human or anything really through just the atmosphere living. The surface of Venus can average over 800 degrees farenheit along with the atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than our own. These conditions are far too much for a human to make it to the surface of Venus which can set back this exploration of Venus.\r\n\r\nMoving on further the author states \"If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?\" He/She answers this question with the thought that long ago Venus may have been just like the earth we live on now. Covered in stable land and oceans, supporting many lifeforms, and maybe vegetation. Reason for thinking this is even today Venus has some features that are similiar to Earth.

Sir Thad The Dong Windlow. \"The dong, fucking epic!\" I said as I noticed one last piece of the majestic throne to The Dong. \n\nEvery knight had a special item next to their armor. Most were pretty lame like flutes, crosses, and kerchiefs. The dong was special though, this bro had a solid gold chamber pot that you just know doubled as a spitter \"no natty ice cans back in the day!\" I said in my mind. \n\nTo show my honor to the dong I whipped mine out and took a piss. As the first drop hit the gold the world began to spin and warp, growing massive and shrinking at the same time. Tripping balls would be considered an under statement. When the trip stop I was in the same hall but it looked vastly different. \n\nI then felt a metal fist grab the back of my neck. I turn to see a knight stand tall above me. His visor flips up and I see Oakley glass under neath. \n\n\"Bro! Bro? Did you fucking piss in my pot? Bro? Are we Eskimo bros? Please tell me you have some fucking skol.... Wench! Come meet my new bro wench!\""}
{"text": "Un nuevo estudio de la Universidad de Yale descubrió que el consumo de sucralosa (utilizado en bebidas dietéticas y alimentos como el helado y el yogurt bajo en calorías) junto con carbohidratos puede aumentar tu riesgo de engordar y de padecer diabetes tipo 2.\n“Se han realizado muchos estudios sobre los edulcorantes artificiales, pero se ha prestado poca o ninguna atención a si se consumen solos o junto con otros alimentos”, dice la autora principal del estudio, Dana Small, Ph.D., profesora de psiquiatría, directora del Centro de Investigación de Dieta y Fisiología Moderna y directora de la división de psiquiatría nutricional en la facultad de Medicina de la Universidad de Yale. El estudio sugiere que consumir sustitutos de azúcar con carbohidratos puede ser particularmente problemático.\nLo que el estudio encontró\nCuando comes carbohidratos, aumentan los niveles de azúcar en la sangre (glucosa) y de insulina. La insulina transporta la glucosa a las células del cuerpo, donde se usa para obtener energía, y los niveles de glucosa vuelven al rango normal. Sin embargo, en algunas personas, las células no responden, se vuelven resistentes a la insulina, y el cuerpo sigue produciendo insulina para reducir el nivel de glucosa. Con el tiempo, esta reacción puede conducir a diabetes tipo 2 y al aumento de peso.\nEn el estudio, publicado en la revista Cell Metabolism los investigadores analizaron el efecto en el cuerpo y el cerebro de 45 participantes sanos que tomaron bebidas que contenían sucralosa sola, azúcar sola o una combinación de sucralosa y maltodextrina (un tipo de carbohidrato que tiene calorías, pero no tiene sabor).\nNi las bebidas de sucralosa ni las de solo de azúcar produjeron una respuesta anormal de la glucosa / insulina, pero la bebida de sucralosa / maltodextrina sí. Y en el cerebro, la combinación causó cambios que con el tiempo podrían alterar qué tan bien el cuerpo maneja el azúcar.\nPara descartar la posibilidad de que la propia maltodextrina fuera responsable, los investigadores agregaron una bebida que contenía solo maltodextrina. Las respuestas de los sujetos a eso también fueron normales.\nUn portavoz del Consejo de Control de Calorías, que representa la industria de alimentos y bebidas con bajo contenido calórico, dijo que la organización “todavía estaba revisando los hallazgos y la metodología del pequeño estudio, pero defiende la seguridad general y los beneficios de la sucralosa y otros edulcorantes bajos en calorías comúnmente utilizados”.\n¿por qué son tan preocupantes los cambios provocados por la combinación de sucralosa y carbohidratos? “No hay una respuesta simple a eso, dice Small. Pero cuando tu cuerpo no responde adecuadamente a la insulina, es probable que la produzca en exceso, lo que puede sobrecargar tu páncreas. También es probable que tengas niveles altos de azúcar en la sangre. Y señala que la glucosa extra en tu cuerpo tiene que ir a algún lado, “Puede almacenarse en el hígado, lo que puede conducir a un hígado graso. O puede dañar otros órganos y provocar prediabetes, enfermedades cardiovasculares e incluso problemas cognitivos”.\nTomar una bebida dietética con una comida que contenga carbohidratos o comer alimentos que contengan carbohidratos y sucralosa ocasionalmente puede no ser un problema. Pero Small señala que la cantidad total de sucralosa consumida por los participantes durante el estudio de 2 semanas fue el equivalente a tomar 14 paquetes de Splenda, dentro del rango en el que la persona promedio realmente podría consumir. “Presumiblemente, con el consumo regular de una bebida, yogur dietético, refresco dietético con papas fritas, se puede acumular fácilmente lo suficiente como para ser un factor en la diabetes”, dice Small.\nSe necesita más investigación sobre la sucralosa, así como sobre el aspartame y otros sustitutos del azúcar, para confirmar estos resultados.\nConclusiones\nEntonces, ¿qué es lo que debe hacer un consumidor goloso por lo dulce? “No quiero que el mensaje sea que debes tomar bebidas endulzadas con azúcar, ya que la evidencia de sus efectos negativos es irrefutable”, dice Small. Y reconoce que, para algunas personas, aquellas con diabetes o prediabetes o aquellas que cuidan su peso, las bebidas dietéticas pueden ser útiles. Si bien el agua siempre es preferible, un refresco dietético ocasional puede ser una opción siempre y cuando no lo bebas con otros alimentos, aconseja. Lo que no se sabe es cuánto tiempo debería haber entre comer carbohidratos y tomar una bebida dietética.\nTambién debes consultar las listas de los ingredientes en los alimentos envasados. “Hay muchos productos en el mercado que contienen sucralosa y azúcares o carbohidratos, incluso en algunos que no están etiquetados como de ‘dieta’ o ‘bajo en azúcar'”. dice Amy Deating, RD, nutricionista de CR.\nSi embargo, hasta que haya más evidencia de sus beneficios y desventajas, lo más sabio puede ser evitar los sustitutos del azúcar o al menos minimizar su consumo. “Estoy convencida de que cuando se trata de edulcorantes artificiales, no sabemos lo suficiente sobre ellos, así que los evito”, dice Small.\nInscríbete para recibir Salud y Bienestar, el nuevo boletín mensual que te ofrece todo sobre salud, nutrición, condición física ¡y mucho más!

{"text": "Vision and language have always been an essential part of human intelligence. With the development of more advanced systems, machines have been catching up with humans perception abilities. For example, image classification tasks, LeNet [1] and ResNet [2] are on par with human evaluation. However, machines are still far behind human regarding comprehension abilities. Visual question answering [3] is task that tests machine ability to comprehend natural languages. Many approaches has been proposed for this task [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] . Among them, the dual attention model combines the semantics of images and texts and reached the 1st place in the MovieQA challenge [9] . Inspired by this model, we propose two three-fold attention architectures to exploit the power of audio.\nThe Movie-QA challenge [9] was proposed for deep machine comprehension of complex scenes. Unlike Visual Question Answering [10] where the model only needs to understand the object in a single image, understanding a movie requires pooling information from multiple video frames and align them with the questions and answers. Previous works [8, 11] focus on attention modules that align certain parts of videos to certain parts of the text. These works have achieved remarkable results and helped us gain understanding about the interaction between vision and language, but does not include the audio information.\nWhen watching movies, humans not only attend to the scenes and dialogue, but also listen to the sound/music accompanies by the scenes, and the audio include information that are not captured in vision and text. The sound of a gun shot indicates that the gun has been fired, whereas an image with a gun alone only indicates the presence of the object. Furthermore, if an event like a car accident happens off-screen, there is no indication from the scene or the subtitles that an accident happened, but we can hear the sound of the vehicles crashing into each other. By adding audio information, we make use of every information we can find in a movie. With this hypothesis, we propose to combine the previously neglected audio information into Movie-QA. We believe our work is interesting and novel in the following aspects: 1) We are the first to incorporate audio information into Movie-QA. and 2) We introduce a triple attention network that combines heterogeneous information sources including question, subtitles, video and audio. Our work can be seen as combining two fields, 1). Audio Event Detection and 2). Visual Question Answering. Our work also falls under the broader category of Multi-modal Machine Learning [12] .\nMovieQA is a video question answering challenge that, given video, audio, subtitles and the question, the model has to predict the right output. In the question set with video clips, the training set, validation set, and the test set has 4385, 1098, and 1288 questions. Each question has 5 answers, only one of them is correct."}

{"text": "Memory is one of the most limiting factors in training deep neural networks [3, 4, 12] . In a training step, forward activations are usually cached and reused during the backward pass. In case of insufficient memory to cache all forward activations, some tensors can be discarded. When needed for gradient calculation, they can be recomputed from stored tensors called checkpoints. This way, models can fit into memory at the expense of additional compute costs. Since compute performance is also often limited in low-memory environments, it is crucial to make best use of resources. In this work, we consider all available devices and combine the idea of tensor rematerialization with distributed computation and tensor swapping in order to get the best performance. Manually assigning the operators to different devices, even without recomputation, is hard-dependency structures can get quite complicated, especially in the backward pass. Simply scheduling the operator on the device with highest compute performance often yields suboptimal schedules due to high copy costs. Our approach tackles the problem of scheduling network operators to heterogeneous compute devices with different compute capabilities and different memory limits using a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) approach.\nThere are various approaches in literature that address the rematerialization of tensors. Earlier works in the field focus on rematerialization of graph segments [3, [5] [6] [7] [8] 24] . Graph-theoretic analyses achieve better results by rematerialization of individual components [1, 12, [14] [15] [16] . All of these approaches consider only a single-device setup. As rematerialization enables training on devices with limited memory, it can also help to address the problem of scheduling the network operators to various heterogeneous devices.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is no other work at the moment that combines rematerialization with distributed computation on multiple heterogeneous devices.\nWe formalize the scheduling problem as an MIQP, using Checkmate [12] as a starting point for our work. This article makes the following contributions:\n• We solve the resource selection and rematerialization problem for inference and training of neural networks on heterogeneous devices using an MIQP. • We show that if a central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) have a similar compute performance in a heterogeneous setting, CPU/GPU schedules can outperform single-device schedules."}

Cerca de la hora de juego un disparo de Cirac se fue por encima del larguero local. De nuevo Cirac volvió a intentarlo en un libre directo, pero el resultado fue el mismo que en el caso anterior y el balón se marchó alto.\nUna gran parada de Salas evitó el gol del Belchite cuando Pablo se quedó solo ante él en el minuto 68. El Tamarite creó alguna ocasión en el tramo final, con Ars, Víctor y Gómez combinando en el ataque local. Ya en el 91 una gran intervención de Salas evitó el gol de Mike que hubiera supuesto la victoria visitante. Al final, ninguno logró marcar y ambas estrenan su casillero de puntos.\nFicha técnica:\nTamarite: Salas, Víctor, Alberto, Ars, Varilla, Pol, Sidi (Balue, 46), Ramón, Casals (Figueres, 63), Alexis (Bernadó, 78) y Gómez."}

He pointed out the Troll's invulnerability and strength, quoting the Closed Highway incident where the military finally stepped in and after bombarding the Troll's position with as many ordinance as were dropped in Iraq during the first half a year of the war, then dug his way out of the rubble and then telekenetically removed the firing pins from every military grade rifle within 5 miles, sped around and removed a single link from the treads of every tank and then made his way to the nearest airbase where he replaced the Jet fuel with koolaide and wrote quips about the pilots mothers on the tips of all the bombs. The poster said that we were lucky that The Troll seems to have no desire to kill anyone, just bug the hell out of our city, with a whopping death toll of 1 (A man he was quick to point out died of a heart attack from fear and his family found a heartfelt apology on their doorstep and a significant deposit in their bank accounts) he's almost harmless, almost. \n\nI liked him until he said I was almost harmless, I hope he liked the peanut butter on his sparkplugs.

{"text": "Discovering new drugs to fulfill specific criteria, such as binding affinity towards a given molecular target, is a fundamental problem in chemistry and the pharmaceutical industry (Hughes et al., 2011) . In this work, we focus on an important subdomain: de novo biological sequence design. This task is challenging for two reasons: (1) the exploration space for sequences is combinatorially large; and (2) sequence usefulness is evaluated via a complicated process which usually involves time-consuming and expensive wet-lab experiments.\nDespite the difficulty of this task, many approaches have been developed over the past few decades thanks to recent advances in biochemistry and machine learning. The Nobel Prize wining paradigm, directed evolution (Chen & Arnold, 1991) , which conducts local evolutionary search under human guidance, is one of the popular techniques. Unfortunately, it is limited by its sample inefficiency and reliance on strong prior knowledge, e.g., about where to mutate (Ahn et al., 2020) . Furthermore, to compete with other machine learning methods (Gottipati et al., 2020) , guided evolution (Yoshikawa et al., 2018; Jensen, 2019; Nigam et al., 2019) heavily relies on human intuition for designing domain-specific evolutionary operators, which may not always apply to tasks at hand.\nIn this work, we deem sequence design to be a black-box optimization problem, tasked with maximizing an unknown oracle function. We assume that oracle queries are limited due to the constraint on resources, such as the budgets for evaluating queries in a wet-lab. Thus, sample efficiency is crucial. We develop a probabilistic framework by reformulating the aforementioned black-box optimization target as a posterior modeling problem. With this framework, we draw a surprising connection between likelihood-free inference and sequence design, and thus linking two fields which are previously considered as unrelated."}

They also say things like \"Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere,\" and \"the atmospheric pressure is over 90 times greater than what we experince on our own planet,\" basically emphasizing that Venus would be almost impossible to explore because of the extreme harsh conditions on the planet.\r\n\r\nFirst off, in paragraph 3 the author writes \"Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" This is the author suming up how impossible it would be to travel there with the technology scientists have today. They even state \"such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans.\" By saying this they are even supporting the fact that scientists can't get there with the technology they have now.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the only support the author has for even traveling to Venus in the first place, is that it is closely related to the planet Earth having features like valleys and mountains. In paragraph 4 he writes \"Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.\" So basically the only reason we should spend the billions of dollars it would take to travel there, is because it is somewhat similar to our planet.

{"text": "The possibility of controlling radio propagation environments is fuelling the interest in reflective intelligent surfaces (RISs) [1, 2] . In particular, it is envisioned that a RIS can circumvent the obstruction of the line-of-sight (LOS) path and make communication possible where it otherwise would not be. However, most evaluations of the RIS benefits in this respect, and in the sense of broadly improving coverage, disregard naturally occurring signal reflections that can play a similar role. This creates the risk of overstating the advantages of deploying a RIS. Indeed, it has been shown that, for an around-the-corner outdoor setting, reflections from building and street poles contribute as much power as a RIS of 0.3 m× 0.3 m [3] , meaning that only a RIS considerable larger than this would have a substantial impact.\nIn indoor settings, ambient propagation might be of even greater importance, yet only seldom it is taken into account [4, 5] . Motivated by this concern, this paper seeks to reference the power conveyed by a RIS to the power naturally reaching a receiver indoors. To prevent artifacts, approximate methods are avoided and we instead resort to an exact assessment on a setting that is simple yet representative, in fact the chief building block of most indoor environments: a room. This suffices to capture the main indoor propagation mechanism at high frequencies, which is the reflection on flat surfaces. Importantly, the LOS path is considered obstructed, as that is when both ambient propagation and a RIS become relevant.\nThe paper begins by establishing the power received in an empty room when transmitter and receiver are randomly positioned (Fig. 1 ), then it repeats the exercise with the room replaced by a RIS (Fig. 2 ), and finally it draws a relationship between the two."}

{"text": "A multi-user game is a setting in which one player's payoff depends not only on that player's action but also on what the other player is doing. In many games, players do not have a dominant strategy among a multitude of options. A well-balanced game provides meaningful options to its players while avoiding dominant strategies. On the other hand, in real life, players might have dominant strategies -strategies that represent the best response to all possible strategies. The best response, on the other hand, is the best strategy given based on what you think or believe the other competitor might do. Nash equilibrium is a kind of stability, described as a combination of strategies in a game so that rational players do not have an incentive to deviate from their choice [1] . A rational player in this context is more related to the selection of actions from a set of alternatives. If an agent is capable of ranking the outcomes of each possible action and able to calculate the possible outcomes for a given sequential set of actions, or able to choose the most preferred outcome with a given action of the other player, he or she is called a \"rational\" player. In addition to rationality, in the auction design, we assume that the actors are strategy-proof, which means that they play the game truthfully. Therefore, if there is a dominant strategy among a set of alternative actions, the player chooses that action or the best strategy truthfully."}

There are many reasons why it's not a good idea. There are many emotions in a student in a class room that a student wouldn't want to be recogize . For many student there always someone who is in love and does not want anyone to figure it out . In paragrahp 3 it tells readers that \" happiness, surpise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness\" can all be shown with the Facial Action Coding System. The student might be sad because the girl wouldn't go out on a date with him and show that emotion in class.\r\n\r\nFor many students I honstley think alot of students would not like it . Another reason why it would not be a good idea to put this new Facial Action Coding System in many classroom is it might distract many of the students. Alot of classroom students are already going through alot of things like stressing, grades, finals, and credits. They wouldn't want that to be pick up by the system for a example a student could be really sad about his grades and doen't want anyone to know. Our minds are only safe place to go where anyone can't go.\r\n\r\nOther places would be a better option for the Facial Action Coding like hostiptals and nursing homes. A good reason why I think it would be a good idea at a hostpital because it can help alot of people that are sick and feeling pain.

{"text": "WASHINGTON—The central question in our politics is whether we can break out of formulaic discussions that always end up in the same place. Here's one major test: Can progressives change their way of thinking about business?\nWe are already seeing a dreary replay of the old argument. Self-styled centrists say that President Obama has really ticked off business leaders and urgently needs to make nice with them.\nBecause the president has spoken occasionally about the irresponsibility of Wall Street and the very wealthy, these poor suffering multimillionaires and billionaires have hurt feelings. Obama is being told he needs to feel their pain, to show he truly understands why they are so aggrieved.\nProgressives bristle at this, and why not? Many among the best off—particularly on Wall Street—were grossly irresponsible stewards of the power surrendered to them through deregulation. They wrecked the economy, Obama bailed them out, and most are now richer than ever. Yet they have the arrogance to complain about the president pointing to their misdeeds."}

{"text": "My father was standing on the balcony when I found him, silhouetted by the setting sun. His vestments were strewn across a chair and he had a drink in his hand. He sipped thoughtfully as he looked down across the bay where the fleet lay at anchor, the royal crest flapping in the breeze. \n\n“ Father? ” I ventured, quietly. He never was a particularly sociable man, and I hated interrupting him when he was in one of his moods. To my surprise I was met with a silence that stretched out between us instead of the usual bitter recriminations or cutting remarks. \n\n“ Yes, son? ” He asked after a while, not turning to look back at me. His shadow stretched across the floor, a silent affirmation of the presence of the man who held the lives of millions in his hands. I was still trying to sort out what I was going to say when he continued, “ Your brother is dead. His party was ambushed on their way to the front. They delivered his head to me in a box. ” Anything else that I had thought to say slipped out of my head immediately. \n\n“ He… ” \n\n“ Is dead, yes, please listen when I am speaking. ” My father sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. “ I apologize, I am… distraught. ” I must admit I was rather taken aback, my father had never once apologized to me in the twenty or so odd years I had known him. As he turned to me I was suddenly struck by how old he seemed, an eternity of sorrows etched into the creases of his face. “ I have sat on this throne for thirty one years, son. And what have I done in all that time? I ignored the teachings of my own father, believing that the might of our kingdom was unstoppable. When I think back to the days of my youth I feel such foolishness. There is always more to learn, son. Even after all this time. ” \n\nI tried to stammer a response but I was still being crushed under the enormity of his simple proclamation. He continued on, “ And now look what I have done. The son I groomed and taught all the ways of warfare and rule is dead. Killed in an instant by a lucky pack of scavengers. I have ignored you for too long, I fear. Perhaps I saw in you too much of myself. Your brother was very much like my father, you see. Cunning, ruthless, with a keen eye for strategy. ” \n\n“ But he was the heir, sir. ” I said, and through a haze of disbelief I remembered my brother's wife. “ His marriage has already been consummated, surely- “ \n\n“ His wife bears no child. ” He interrupted immediately. “ And as the eldest living male descendent of my house, the throne falls to you. It will be a difficult road, my son, and we have so little time. Perhaps I will come to realize that you will be a greater ruler than even your brother might have been. ” \n\nI had never considered or even made pretensions to the throne; it had always been my brother's birthright. But standing in my father's quarters with the sea winds blowing in and the last sunset of summer sinking below the horizon, I could almost see myself there. “ I will endeavor to do my best, father. ” \n\n“ Here is your first lesson: be ever vigilant. Across the sea there are many that would come to our shores and kill our people for wealth and enrichment. To the north and east enemies press in, looting villages and killing as they go. ” He took a long draught and set his empty glass on the railing. “ They call us monsters, son. And you must be ready. ”"}

{"text": "Recently, researchers successfully applied Semantic methods to Genetic Programming (SGP) on different domains, showing promising results [1, 2, 3] . While the classic GP operators (e.g., selection, crossover and mutation) act at the syntactic level, blindly to the semantic (behavior) of the individuals (e.g., programs), the key idea of SGP is to apply semantic evaluations [1] . More specifically, classic GP operators ignore the behavioral characteristic of the offspring, focusing only on improving the fitness of the individuals. Differently, SGP uses a richer feedback during the evolution that incorporates semantic awareness, which has the potential to improve the power of genetic programming [1] .\nIn this paper, we are considering the Symbolic Regression domain, and thus assuming the availability of training cases (defined as m pairs of inputs and desired output). Following the most popular SGP approaches [1] , we intend \"semantics\" as the set of output values of a program on the training cases [4] . Such an approach obtains a richer feedback during the evolution relying on the This is the authors version of this work. It was later published in: European Conference on Genetic Programming (EuroGP '20) evaluation of the individuals on the training cases. More formally, the semantics of an individual I is a vector sem(I) = y 1 , y 2 , • • • , y m of responses to the m inputs of the training cases. Let sem(ŷ) = ŷ1 , ŷ2 , • • • , ŷm denote the semantic vector of the target (as defined in the training set), where ŷ1 , ŷ2 , • • • , ŷm are the desired outputs. SGP defines semantic space [1] with a metric that characterizes the distance between the semantic vectors of the individuals sem(I) and the target sem(ŷ). SGP often relies on such a distance to compute the fitness score, inducing a unimodal fitness landscape, which avoids local optima by construction [5] ."}

I stare blankly out the window, as rain meanders its way down, obstructing my view of the street -- the street my wife drove off on two hours ago. Our marriage had been prosaic lately, to put it lightly. Now, I'll accept my fair share of the blame, and Mary has every right to be angry with me. I was absent; I was apathetic; I was remiss of any marital duties. \n\nI can't tell you why I had lost interest, but I need to think fast. She gave me an ultimatum -- a directive of sorts -- to give her a reason to stay with me. We'd been married for three years now and it was thrilling at first: we were hopelessly in love with each other.

She brings home my favourite doughnut when I'm under stress because she knows it'll make me feel loved (and it unfailingly does). She'll affectionately play with my hair as I lay reading, complimenting me on my eyes. She'll squeeze my arm as we walk, which makes me feel wanted -- it makes me feel needed. But I find myself unable to reciprocate and it's breaking her heart; it's breaking my heart. \n\nI'm faced with an ostensibly incurable dilemma. I now have less than 22 hours to convince her that I do still love her, that I will make her happy like I once did. But do I want to?

She did however remember working at the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. She would routinely bring samples over to the CDC, but she did not recognize Dr. Schutz or this particular lab. “ Nice to meet you, again. ” She extended her right hand as she reminded herself to squeeze firmly, as she had to do with every handshake. \n\n“ Now, the samples? ” Dennis asked hastily. “ I almost have the vaccines complete. I hope with these samples of the virus I can have the antigen finished in another day and we can get rid of this worrisome bug before more of your children are affected. ” Pamela considered all of the kids at CHoA as her own, maybe fueled by the fact she couldn't actually have children. \n\n“ Right here, Dennis. ” She passed over the aluminum container, that closely resembled a soup thermos. “ Do you mind if I to sit for a bit? I think I am having another migraine. ” She took a seat in the lab chair as she massaged each temple with only her index fingers. \n\nDr. Schutz gloved his large hands and eagerly opened the sample case and went to work carefully removing the first of the sample vials. He placed each vial inside the open centrifuge on his benchtop, started the machine, and set the timer for 3.25 hours.

What-am-I-doing-here? ” Pamela asked, her confusion obvious. Her voice broke his silent concentration. \n\n“ You just dropped off some samples, remember? Dr. Jenkins, I think you need some rest. ” \n\n“ Samples, no. The last thing I remember is waking up this morning. Then I got this terrible headache! Wait, what were the samples for? ” \n\nDennis reached out and placed the back of his hand on her slightly sweaty forehead. “ I think you have a fever, Pamela, you really should go get checked out. The samples were for the D-147 variant of the recent viral outbreak. ” \n\n“ Right, right. No, I remember the virus. I think I just need some rest, ” she said, “ I think I'll just go home for the day. ” She slowly got to her feet, and exited the CDC vaccination lab. \n\nDennis glanced at his watch, then at his notes. “ About three more hours in the centrifuge, ” he thought, “ I could use a nap myself. I haven't slept in three days. ” He waddled to his office, took his glasses off, and found a seat in his favorite desk chair. He propped his feet on his desk and let the memory of the last days'work lull him to sleep. \n\nBEEP BEEP BEEP! BEEP BEEP BEEP! BEEP BEEP BEEP! \n\nThe alarm from the centrifuge startled Dr. Schutz from his sleep. His headache was pounding, almost louder than that incessant noise."}

{"text": "Transformer-based rankers have shown state-of-the-art performance for many tasks. However the self-attention operation in these models cannot be applied to long sequences, as its complexity scales quadratically with the sequence length [14] . Unfortunately, documents in ad-hoc information retrieval are usually much longer than the length that the self-attention operation can be applied to. We propose a query-driven segment selector approach to effectively train the basic BERT-based ranker [3] for long documents.\nThere are two common approaches for handling long documents in transformer models. The first addresses the problem by dividing the document tokens into segments of similar length and applying the self-attention mechanism only within those segments (local self-attention) then aggregating vectors from segments to get the final score. [1, 5, 9, 10] . A second approach also starts by dividing the document tokens into segments and treating each of them as if it were a document in its own right. If the segments are small enough, the complexity problem is similarly limited. The starting document's score is typically found with an aggregation (e.g., average or max) of the segments' scores [3, 18] . It appears that the second approach is more commonly used. Indeed, we note that the first approach requires limiting the size of the input document in the training [5] (though allows it to be larger).\nTo train the second category of approaches, we can consider different segments of a long document to use for training samples. For example, we can use all segments, a randomly selected subset, the first or last segment. Choosing the first segment is very commonand very appropriate for news stories that often provide a summary of the key points in the first few paragraphs. However the segments are chosen, each provides a separate training instance. The relevance label of each selected segment of a document is inherited from the relevance label of the entire document.\nIn ad-hoc information retrieval, a document is considered relevant to a query even if only a small part of the document is relevant to the query [13] . This relevant information can occur in any part of a document and could be as short as a single sentence or even a clause. Thus, it is possible that heuristically selected segments do not contain the part of document that is relevant to the query and, indeed, may actually be completely non-relevant. We demonstrate in this study that such noise in the training data leads to poor training of the model and harms performance.\nInstead of heuristic selection of document segments to train a Transformer-based ranker, we propose to explicitly select which segment of a document should be used for the training. Our proposed method, which we named BeST (BEst Segment Training), scores different segments of a document and selects the one that is most related to the query to build the training data for the subsequent ranker."}

But now the sun is setting to my back, the last rays reaching through the trees and brush that's growing thicker and darker as I move, the pleasant chill in the air turning into a stinging cold that burns my chest. A fire that runs through my vains to set every muscle alight until my body is a screaming symphony of pain. \n\nAnd still I run. \n\nThis was not supposed to happen. This was not what I was promised. What have I done to deserve this, how can life be this unfair? \n\n-- - \n\nLily was the first to turn eighteen. Excited? Yes. But the biggest emotion we shared in silence that day was a deep and humbling fear. \n\nWe're all five of us the spitting image of our mother. Our mom, whose True Power is of the A-Class, which meant we were likely to be blessed with similar genetics. Myself, I secretly liked to muse, even more so, as I deemed my messy mop of sun bleached blonde a closer resemblance to my mother's golden waves than my sisters silky chestnut trestles. \n\nNow our father, we love him dearly. But even dad himself didn't blame us for not wanting his genes.... \n\nYou see, our father is a C-class. And C-class means, well, it basically means you're good as useless. \n\nShallowfish (those with the power to breathe under water, but only when it's no more than three inches deep), Cagebirds (they can fly, but only in small confined spaces such as elevators) and Wafers (who can turn invisible, but only for five percent, mockingly called Opacity Bugs).... Those are the most frequent C-classes. \n\nDon't get me wrong: In no way are C-classes lesser human beings. We need them, after all. To clean our toilets, paint our houses, pick up our garbage and nanny our kids. There is no shame in being a C-class. \n\nAt least, that's what everyone *says*. Out loud, with a polite smile and well-feigned look of sincerity. But we all *think* the same thing. \n\nThe thought creeps in as soon as we're old enough to learn the meaning of True Powers, and from that moment on it grows louder and louder until you are so close to your day of truth that your whole mind is consumed by it: *Please, please, I don't want to be a C-class. * \n\nMy dad's what they call a Rash. It's a rare type of C-class, and often referred to by some elitist A-classes (only amongst each other, and only behind closed doors) as a D-class. It's not an official classification, but it's what the snobs call someone whose True Power is not only useless, but actually slightly inconvenient. \n\nYou see, when my dad touches skin with his bare fingertips (not his own, thankfully, just imagine that!) it causes a very faint itch and nearly invisible discolouration of the skin. In other words: all human beings are basically allergic to my dad's touch. Lucky guy. \n\nThankfully, he's wicked smart and has a great sense of humour. And as much as our Powers influence our lives, by all means it's not the Power one falls in love with. That would, after all, be as silly as loving someone merely for their beauty. \n\nWhen Lily healed her first flower on the morning of her eighteenth, a weight had been lifted that all five of us had shared for too long. When Rose's turn came a little over a year later, it would be a lie to claim that that fear did not return to the four of us still waiting to discover our fate. \n\nWhen Rose, too, proved to be her mother's daughter, the fear was washed clean away as we watched our sister lift the dewdrops from the grass around her and made it swirl and dance and rain all around us. \n\nWhen Jasmine and Violet's year came, the fear was but a soft dull glow, excitement taking the upper hand, then exploding into euphoria and filling our hearts with joy as Jaz and Vi filled the air with sparks. \n\nAnd then it was my turn. \"You ain't scared at all, Sam?\" My friends didn't believe me, but it was true: I wasn't. Not a bit. In fact, I could hardly contain myself. Could hardly wait. \n\nIt was only this morning, but it feels a lifetime ago. The five of us tiptoed down the stairs on our bare feet and stood in silence in our backyard on the cold wet grass, looking down the hill over the the woods behind our house. I felt my fathers strong hands grip my shoulders and rub my arms reassuringly, the thin layers of synthetic cloth on his fingertips soft against my goosebump skin. \n\nMy mother planted a long, sweet kiss on the top of my head. There were tears in her eyes, near the point of spilling over the cheeks that bear the same freckles as mine. \n\nLily, Rose, Jasmine and Violet, they gathered'round me and hugged and squeezed and cried (oh, their tears were flowing freely) and whispered soft words of courage and pride. \n\nBut when the first rays of sunlight danced over the treetops and set the woods ablaze in a sea of yellow and green flames, they let go of their littlest sister, hugging each other close as I stepped forward to receive my True Power with open arms. \n\nOh, how I wish I could give it back. \n\n-- - \n\nThey're faces are swirling around my head like dead leaves caught in a storm. I feel their emotions rip into me as they flash by: Pride, excitement. Confusion, disbelief. Horror, disgust. Fear. \n\nIn the eyes of my father, I see it. And for some reason my cruel brain latches onto the image like a tick. This was his greatest fear and I made it reality: Causing his little girl a lifetime of misfortune with his shitty genes. And somehow it felt reassuring: It told me I'd never be alone."}

There has been a great success in benchmarking 2D and 3D nuclei segmentation methods using datasets covering samples from various species [4, 34, 28, 31] . However, existing datasets only have relatively small samples from brain tissues (e.g., volumes from mouse and rat brains [24] smaller than 10 -3 mm 3 , with less than 200 instances each), restricting the investigation of neuronal nuclei in a larger and more diverse scale. Besides, most of the images are collected with optical microscopy, which can not reflect the challenges in other imaging modalities widely used in studying brain tissues, including electron microscopy (EM) [15, 13, 25] and micro-CT (uCT) [9] .\nTo address this deficiency in the field, we have curated a large-scale 3D nuclei instance segmentation dataset, NucMM, which is over two magnitudes larger in terms of volume size and the number of instances than previous neuronal nuclei datasets [4, 24] and widely-used non-neuronal benchmark datasets [1, 34] . Our NucMM consists of one EM image volume covering a nearly entire larval zebrafish brain and a uCT image volume from the visual cortex of an adult mouse, facilitating large-scale cross-tissue and cross-modality comparison. Challenges in the two volumes for automatic approaches include the high density of closely touching instances (Fig. 1 , left) and low contrast between object and nonobject regions (Fig. 1 , right). We also perform a statistical analysis to provide a quantitative justification of the challenges in these two volumes (Fig. 2 ).\nTo tackle the challenges introduced by the large-scale NucMM dataset, we propose a new hybrid-representation model that learns foreground mask, instance contour map, and signed distance transform simultaneously with a 3D U-Net [5] architecture, which is denoted as U3D-BCD. At inference time, we utilize a multi-target watershed segmentation algorithm that combines all three predictions to separate closely touching instances and generate high-quality instance masks. Under the average precision (AP) metric for evaluating instance segmentation approaches, we show that our U3D-BCD model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches by 22% on the NucMM dataset."}

{"text": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved impressive and promising results in robotics, such as manipulation [1] , unmanned vehicle navigation [2] , drone flight [3] , [4] , etc., thanks to its ability of handling intricate models and adapting to diverse problem scenarios with ease. Meanwhile, a safe control policy is imperative for a robot in the real world, as dangerous behaviors can cause irreparable damage or costly losses. Therefore, the RL methods that can provide a safety guarantee for robot control have received considerable interest and progress [5] , [6] , [7] , [8] , [9] , [10] .\nA recent line of work focuses on designing novel RL algorithms, e.g., actor-critic, for constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). In these methods, the system encourages the satisfaction of the constraints by adding a constant penalty to the objective function [6] or constructing safety critics while doing policy optimization in a multi-objective manner [5] , [7] , [11] , [12] . Although these approaches are attractive for their generality and simplicity, they either need model [6] , or only encourage the safety constraints to be satisfied probabilistically.\nAn alternative type of methods focuses on reachability and safety guarantee (sufficient conditions) by constructing/learning control Lyapunov functions (CLF) and control barrier functions (CBF) that can respectively certify the reachability and safety [8] , [10] , [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] , [17] , [18] . The relevant safe controllers are normally designed by adding a safety filter to a reference controller, such as a RL Fig. 1 . The 2D quadrotor navigation task. Lines stand for trajectories. The circles are the initial position. The blue regions represent obstacles.

Even though there are learning methods to find CLFs and CBFs, knowledge of dynamic models has to be explicitly used [21] .\nIn this paper, we propose a data-based reachability and safety theorem without explicitly using the knowledge of a dynamic system model."}

Using this Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students is not valuable.\r\n\r\nThere might come a time when a person is sad because he or she has lost a loved one. That person probably would not want anyone knowing how he or she is feeling at the moment. If a computer is used to understand his or her emotions, it could cause that person to be more upset or sad. The computer could acknowledge emotional expressions, but it still has yet to learn how to respond in a situation where that person needs help.

Avant cette finale historique pour le Paris Saint-Germain, qui n’a jamais remporté la Ligue des champions, Leonardo a les yeux rivés sur le défenseur français. Selon les révélation de L’Équipe, le profil du défenseur du club bavarois plaît sérieusement au directeur sportif de l’équipe parisienne. Ses performances cette saison en Bundesliga ont achevé de convaincre le dirigeant du PSG sur son idée de recruter l’ancien joueur du LOSC. Pour rappel, Benjamin Pavard a été le joueur de champ le plus utilisé par Hans-Dieter Flick. Il a pris part à 47 matchs toutes compétitions confondues, soit 32 en championnat, pour 31 titularisations. D’après le quotidien sportif, Leonardo « ne cache pas, en privé, apprécier le profil » de l’arrière latéral droit. Outre son pédigrée et de ses performances, Benjamin Pavard rentre bien dans la nouvelle politique de francisation souhaitée par les propriétaires qataris, à en croire la source. Cette dernière précise cependant que le nom du joueur est certes coché par le directeur sportif du Paris SG, mais qu' « aucune démarche concrète » n'a encore été menée pour l’instant.\nBenjamin Pavard vaut 45 M€ au moins\nDébaucher le joueur de 24 ans ne sera pas un jeu d'enfants pour Leonardo, car ce dernier est inscrit dans le projet du Bayern Munich, où il est adulé par la direction et le staff technique."}

{"text": "Several studies about Hybrid Unmanned Aerial Underwater Vehicles (HUAUVs) have been conducted recently [1] - [8] . These vehicles provide an interesting range of possible applications due to the capability to act in two different environments, including inspection and mapping of partly submerged areas in industrial facilities, search and rescue and other military-related applications. However, the state-of-the-art is yet focused on the vehicle design and structure, where even fewer studies around autonomous navigation have been conducted [9] . The ability to perform tasks in both environments and successfully transit between them imposes additional challenges that must be addressed to make this mobile vehicle autonomously feasible.\nApproaches based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep-RL) techniques have been enhanced to address navigationrelated tasks for a range of mobile vehicles, including ground mobile robots [10] , aerial robots [11] , [12] and underwater robots [13] . These approaches based on single critic actorcritic techniques with multi-layer network structures have achieved interesting results in performing mapless navigation, obstacle avoidance and media transitioning even for HUAUVs [9] . However, the challenges faced by this kind of vehicle make these approaches limited, not being capable of escalating to more complex scenarios for a rescue navigation task, for example.\nIn this work, we explore the use of Deep-RL in the context of HUAUVs to perform navigation-related tasks that can simulate through environmental rescue tasks in robotics. We present two enhanced approaches based on state-of-the-art Deep-RL for the continuous state: (1) a deterministic based on Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) [14] ; and (2) a stochastic based on Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) [15] . We show that we are capable of training agents with a consistently better capability than state-of-the-art, performing with more stability the mapless navigation, obstacle avoidance and medium transition. We perform a two-fold way evaluation with air-to-water and water-to-air navigation. We compare our DoCRL approaches with single critic-based approaches used to perform mapless navigation and with an adapted version of a traditional Behavior-Based Algorithm (BBA) [16] used in aerial vehicles. Our proposed double critic formulation can be seen in Fig. 1 .\nThis work contains the following main contributions:\n• We propose two approaches based on state-of-the-art actor-critic double critic Deep-RL algorithms that can successfully perform goal-oriented mapless navigation for HUAUVs, using only range data readings and the vehicles' relative localization data."}

{"text": "Graphs are widely used data structures that capture relational and structural information between individual entities (nodes) via connections (edges) in many domains. For example, in social networks, a graph-based learning system leverages structural and feature information to make accurate user recommendations. Similarly, in an e-commerce platform, a transaction network can be used to detect fraudulent transactions. Real-world graphs are diverse. For a simple recommendation scenario consisting of user and item nodes, the user nodes would include information about age, gender, and income. Whereas the item nodes (e.g. a movie) would be characterized by the genre, length, and list of actors. Additionally, edge features may contain information about the rating the user gave a movie. Such attributed graphs are prevalent, where the graph dataset's structure is enriched with features of the nodes and edges.\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) have recently received increasing attention due to the wide range of applications that deal with data naturally represented as graphs. Motivated by similar developments in other domains, there have been efforts to extend the benefit of deep learning to this non-Euclidean domain enabling more streamlined approaches that leverage the relational data. Various methods have been developed to learn from graph data, such as Node2Vec [14] , graph convolution networks (GCN) [21] , and graph attention networks (GAT) [40] which have been used for a variety of tasks including node classification [21] , link prediction [26] , graph clustering [16] . These methods are collectively referred to as geometric deep learning [6] .\nA central problem in geometric deep learning is the need for real-world datasets that are large enough for industry-scale problems. Most of the larger public datasets are similar and are often derived from academic citation networks [17] , which are too small for these problems. This lack of diversity limits the development of graph neural networks (GNN) and their evaluation. In this work, we propose a framework for synthetic graph generation which can systematically generate graphs with corresponding node or edge features in a scalable manner. Generating realistic large-scale graph datasets, which we define as graphs with billions to trillions of edges that simulate real-world datasets distributions, will enable data sharing and facilitate the development of GNNs that scale to such large graph size."}
{"text": "Computing is at a crossroads: just as the transistor-scaling driven by Moore's Law has afforded improvements in conventional CMOS-based computing performance, there is an inevitable slowing down due to fundamental device limits 1 . Furthermore, the inherently deterministic nature of conventional computing makes the current CMOS model unsuitable for contending with the continued future growth of applications such as in neuromorphic computing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) 2 .\nA superior approach is that of probabilistic computing. In probabilistic computing, the key component is the probabilistic bit (or p-bit), a unit that fluctuates randomly, but controllably, between 0 and 1 3 . Indeed, a network of such p-bits can leverage their stochastic nature to function as efficient hardware accelerators for solving complex problems that are themselves inherently probabilistic. These problems, which lie at the core of many real-world machine learning applications and algorithms of AI, range in nature from combinatorial optimization problems (such as integer factorization) to recognition and classification [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .\nAt its core, a p-bit requires a tunable stochastic element. While it should be noted that this can be implemented with standard CMOS technology [17] [18] [19] and a significant device overhead, the resulting p-bit suffers from a large areal and energy footprint, as well as not offering true randomness 20 .\nAn ultra-compact approach for tunable randomness that yields the desired sigmoidal-shaped input/output characteristics, which is scalable and energy-efficient, is achieved by exploiting the physics of low-barrier fluctuating nanomagnets when coupled with existing Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) technology. Such p-bit implementations using stochastic MTJs have been shown [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , but as yet, the proof-of-concept implementations have required field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) or external circuitry, with orders of magnitude more transistors involved than needed in the 3T-1MTJ p-bit design explored in this work."}
{"text": "The Q-learning algorithm introduced in [28] is a highly celebrated approach to reinforcement learning, that has evolved over the past decades to form part of the solution to complex optimal control problems. It was originally designed to compute the state-action value function (known as the Q-function). This early work considered the discounted-cost optimal control problem for Markov decision processes (MDPs), in the tabular setting so that the function class spans all functions.\nThe ultimate goal then and now is to approximate the Q-function within a restricted function class, notably neural networks, though much of the theory is restricted to a linearly parameterized function class. Counterexamples show that conditions on the function class are required in general, even in a linear function approximation setting [2, 27, 9] . Criteria for stability based on sufficient exploration are contained in the recent work [18] .\nMoreover, when convergent, the limit of Q-learning or DQN solves a \"projected Bellman equation\" (see (11) ), but we know little about the implication of this conclusion. These concerns have motivated new ways of thinking about how to approximate a Q-function.\nOne alternative is GQ learning, based on a stochastic gradient descent algorithm with an objective similar to the mean-square Bellman error [25] . Recently a more exact stochastic gradient descent algorithm was introduced in [1] with full stability analysis. These results present a significant advancement but come with two drawbacks: the objective is non-convex, so there is no reason to believe the algorithm will converge to the global minimum. Moreover, it remains difficult to interpret the solution of the global minimum. If the Bellman error is small in an L 2 sense, where the L 2 norm depends on training data, what does this tell us about the performance of the ultimate feedback policy?\nThe linear programming (LP) approach to optimal control pioneered by Manne [15] has inspired alternative approaches to RL and approximate dynamic programming. The earliest such work was found in [23] , with error bounds appearing in [5, 4, 11] . Model-free algorithms appeared in [16, 12, 13] and [17, Ch. 5] , where the term convex Q-learning (CvxQ) was coined. In parallel came logistic Q-learning [3] , which solves a regularized dual of the LP in [12] . There is however a gap in the settings: CvxQ was developed for deterministic control systems, while logistic Q-learning treats MDPs. Also, the stochastic setting is so far restricted to tabular [3] or linearly factorable MDPs [20] . Theory for CvxQ has few restrictions, beyond the limitation to deterministic control systems.\nLP approaches are attractive because we obtain by design a convergent algorithm. Moreover, the L ∞ -framework is more likely to lead to an interpretable solution, since performance bounds on the resulting feedback policy can be obtained through Lyapunov function techniques [5, 11] . The main contributions are summarized here: i) Convex Q-learning for optimal control is introduced in a stochastic environment for the first time. It is found that the constraint region is bounded subject to a persistence of excitation, generalizing the conclusions obtained recently for deterministic optimal control problems [13] . Several approaches to approximating the solution to the convex program are proposed and analyzed.\nii) Prop. 2.5 implies a surprising connection between CvxQ and standard Q-learning.\niii) Techniques are introduced to obtain the rate of convergence in a mean-square sense-see Prop. A.1.\nComparison with existing literature. The new algorithms and some of the analysis might be anticipated from the theory for deterministic control systems in [13] . Prop. 2.5 is new (and was initially surprising to us) even in the deterministic setting. The variance analysis surveyed in Prop. A.1 is novel, resting on recent CLT theory from [24] to obtain an exact formula for the asymptotic covariance. Complementary results appeared in [21] , motivated by MDP LP relaxations. Conclusions in this prior work is based on i.i.d. samples of trajectories, designed to permit application of Hoeffding's inequality to obtain sample complexity bounds for constraint-sampled LPs."}

{"text": "A UTONOMY is the ability of a robot or machine to per- form a task without any human intervention. In robotics and transportation, autonomous tasks usually involve gathering information from the environment (sensing), identifying the agent's current position (localization), devising a safe navigation strategy (planning), and compensating for unexpected changes (control) [1] - [3] . A particularly challenging step of this process is the motion planning stage [1] - [4] , wherein an agent with uncertain information about its position and environment must devise an admissible and collision-free trajectory to be followed toward a final destination. This highly complex task has received widespread research interest [2] - [11] , as it requires a delicate balance between computational complexity and optimality while simultaneously respecting the agent's dynamic capabilities.\nStandard approaches to solving this problem can be broadly categorized into three groups: Grid-based search (GBS), Sampling-based Planning (SBP), and Optimizationbased (OB). GBS algorithms assign each configuration of the dynamical system to a grid point and use graph search algorithms such as Dijkstra [5] , A * [6] , and D * [7] to find a path. Although GBS algorithms are easy to implement and often provide an acceptable answer, they scale poorly with the number of degrees of freedom of the configuration space [12] and fail to ensure the dynamic feasibility of the path. SBP algorithms [3] , such as rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) [8] , probabilistic roadmap methods (PRMs) [4] , and their variants scale better for high-dimensional problems. However, optimality guarantees are usually absent, and path feasibility is only achieved via sufficiently dense sampling of either the configuration or action space [12] . On the other hand, OB algorithms such as direct multiple-shooting [13] and direct collocation [14] explicitly consider the dynamic constraints in the optimization problems, providing by construction dynamically feasible trajectories which can be enforced to avoid collisions [15] , [16] . However, OB algorithms suffer from high computational costs, typically requiring solving a nonlinear programming problem without convergence guarantees [11] .\nTwo common features of the above-mentioned solutions are (a) the struggle between the computational complexity of the planning process and the need to enforce dynamic constraints and (b) the open-loop nature of the solution that does not account for unmodeled dynamics or disturbances."}
{"text": "Journalism has always been a dangerous profession. From 2016 to 2021, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) reported that 455 journalists were killed for their work or while on the job [60] . The online landscape of contemporary journalism has raised further concerns of novel threats to journalists' safety and expression, such as doxxing, swatting, coordinated harassment campaigns, and dogpiling [44, 46] . Such online violence disproportionately affects marginalized-identity journalists: in 2020, UNESCO found that 73% of women journalists reported experiencing online violence in the course of their work [44] . Likewise, the perceived lack of systemic support from news organizations and social platforms has burdened journalists, especially women and minority-identity journalists, with the responsibility of protecting themselves [3, 10] . As a direct result of online violence, the constant vigilance required to monitor it, and the lack of resources to handle it, journalists have reported experiencing fatigue, burnout, or psychological trauma and have expressed a desire to exit the profession altogether [10, 32] .\nJournalists are subject to various standards for social media engagement that have made existing online harassment resources difficult or impossible to use. Oftentimes both explicit and implicit, the journalistic standards for social media require that journalists consume or even engage with potentially harmful content to do their jobs. Not only do news organizations subject journalists to social media policies that encourage journalists to maintain an \"active\" and \"authentic\" online persona [40] , but also journalists' role in society obliges that they fulfill a social contract to inform the public [52] . Prior work has proposed systems to protect social media users more broadly against online harassment, leveraging community support to curate word or account blocklists [23, 25, 42, 58] . However, simply filtering content or accounts does not address journalists' specific needs to monitor the comments they receive and remain accessible to the public. The tension between these professional standards for participation and unmet safety needs in online spaces has left journalists struggling to manage their online presence.\nIn this paper, we begin by formalizing the specific online safety needs of journalists. We conduct semi-structured interviews with eight minority-identity journalists, focusing on the nuances of their harassment experiences, protective strategies, and moderation practices; we coupled these interviews with a closed card sorting exercise to investigate journalists' decision-making processes when interfacing with harassment. We found that, at the time of our interviews in 2022, journalists heavily relied on social media platforms like Twitter/X for work, but these platforms were also the primary vectors for online harassment. Still, journalists expressed a high willingness to interact with users critiquing their stories and an appetite for understanding their audience response, even if their language was negative or passionate. As a result, journalists often manually weigh each of their comments, considering its relevance to their work and how reasonable the commenter appears, to decide how they might engage. Even when faced with abusive interactions, some journalists were hesitant to leverage existing platform moderation mechanisms (e.g., blocking or muting accounts)."}

{"text": "There are many ways for a human being to convey an emotion with a facial expression. Someone can indicate happiness by smiling, sadness by frowning, or, confusion by furrowing their eyebrows. Each facial expression signifies someone's emotions or thoughts to others. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a new technology that allows computers to recognize and identify human emotions. Although the FACS is a creative and unique way of identifying human emotions, using the FACS to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable.\r\n\r\nThe main reason why using the FACS to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable is because of the importance of expressing human emotions to others. In a world full of new technology that is constantly being improved, it is appealing for people to try out new gadgets and devices. However, as people are connecting with technology instead of connecting with other human beings face to face, the social aspect of humans is failing. In Nik D'Alto's article about the FACS, he excitedly asks readers the question, \"Hold on! Can we actually 'calculate' emotions - like math homework?\" The FACS's goal is to \"'calculate' emotions - like math homework.\" The FACS denies students the chance to feel empathy for others. If students are constantly concerning themselves with what the computer \"calculate[d]\" their emotions to be, then students feel like they can only express themselves through technology."}

You know it and I know it. Pundits may refer to me as the Social Media President or the first populist president of the 21st century but in truth I was the first person to be upvoted to the Presidency. \n\nWhat brought us here? \n\"Mike Paulatowski needs you motherfuckers to vote!\" \n\nThe gag was simple enough. I gave a profanity laden address to an 8th grade school assembly, with a megaphone, demanding that \"you motherfuckers need to vote for me, cause I will CLEAN - SHIT - UP!\" I think the real thing that took it viral was the reaction of the kids. They thought it was hilarious. A grown man acting like a crazy person and trying to get elected to be the class president. They got the joke, the rest of you clearly did not. \n\nAnd then came the follow up videos. They were a hit and I was famous. Everything was cool. \n\nSoon reddit got a hold of it and sexybeeffarts45 started that god damned write in campaign. At the time I was foolish and just ran with it. And then there I was getting sworn in. \n\nA lot of so-called political professionals like to say that there was a simplicity to the message of \"cleaning shit up\" or that I captured the Zeitgeist. Those people are full of shit. Americans were just fed up with a political system that wasn't working for them anymore and decided to send a clown to DC. Too bad we got rid of the electoral college, that could've prevented this sort of thing from happening. \n\nMy dad always told me winners never quit and quitters never win but he never said anything about getting fired. And Lord knows I tried. \n\nFirst I used the provisions of the Patriot Act II to declare war on Canada. I figured nobody would want to go to war with Canada because they're so nice. I figured wrong. Oil companies thought it was a fantastic idea. It was a short war. Nine days. The price of oil plummeted and the economy grew by double-digit percentages. \n\nNext I decided to make an ass of myself at my first state of the Union address. I gave a three word speech. \"Fuck All Y'all\". Overnight my approval rating jumped 15 points. They called it \"refreshing\". \n\nWith nothing working, I concluded that I would have to come up with something that everyone would agree was horrifying. The end of social security. Who could possibly support this? I did succeed in trashing my approval ratings at first."}

Si ya era frecuente zanjar los procedimientos con un acuerdo entre las partes, por el cual el acusado reconocía los hechos evitando la celebración del juicio, ahora esta alternativa se ha convertido en la prioritaria en los tres juzgados de lo ciudad. Y el COVID ha contribuido a ello. Tanto es así, que de las 843 sentencias emitidas por las magistradas de lo Penal el año pasado, 525 se fallaron tras un acuerdo de conformidad; prácticamente siete de cada diez, según las estadísticas del Consejo General del Poder Judicial (CGPJ).\nEvitar el juicio\nEste impulso en las resoluciones por conformidad viene motivado en gran medida por la pandemia. Esta fórmula permite evitar la vista oral cuando un acusado asume la culpa y la continuación del procedimiento en otras instancias al comprometerse las partes a no recurrir la sentencia.\nDe esta forma, se gana rapidez ya que se trata de comparecencias que duran unos pocos minutos. Otro aspecto fundamental en el momento actual es que se evitan las aglomeraciones de testigos, peritos o agentes en los pasillos y entrada al órgano judicial, aunque si bien en cierto, muchos de estos acuerdos se fraguan minutos antes de la hora del señalamiento, siendo ya citados y personados los testigos.\nPena menor\nA mayores, para los acusados que aceptan este pacto, las penas siempre son más bajas que las solicitadas por la acusación inicialmente.\nEstas conformidades permitieron agilizar una parte importante de los cientos de juicios penales que hubo que suspender a consecuencia del confinamiento y si ya fueron un habitual el año pasado, también este 2021 son uno de los recursos más frecuentes por las partes.\nEsta índice de conformidades afecta a toda la jurisdicción penal; incluida la Audiencia Provincial.

{"text": "When a company is launching a new product and wants to use social media for marketing, understanding who to hire for such campaigns becomes of most importance to maximize profit. With the explosion of social media in recent years, a common strategy has been to target certain influential individuals for advertising. These individuals, or \"influencers,\" become the initial spreaders in different social settings, and through their connections and followers, companies reach greater awareness (and sales) in the entire society. However, social groups are constantly evolving and thus influencers in certain social setting may no longer be the optimal selection in the few months or years until the product is released, which can lower efficiency. It becomes clear, then, that being able to predict future influencers is extremely important.\nWithin a mathematical setting, one can consider social networks as graphs, where the nodes represent members of the network, and their connections are represented by edges. The study of how nodes can influence a network has been done for many decades, and the reader can refer to recent surveys such as Lü et al.'s [42] in 2016, Pei et al.'s [50] in 2019, and AbdulAmeer et al.'s [3] in 2022 to learn about the scope of such work.\nIn particular, Domingos and Richardson [16] studied influence through a viral marketing perspective. In 2003, Kempe et al. [30] formalized this as the influence maximization problem (IMP) of choosing k nodes of greatest influence, proving that a complete solution was NP-hard. However, it is interesting to note that to the best of our knowledge, no mathematical definition of a social Influencer as been proposed in the literature, and thus we shall introduce here what we think can be a useful way of thinking of such important individuals within our society (see Definition 29) .\nIn the present paper we will focus on heuristic measures, revolving around local centralities due to lower time complexity: while global metrics take into consider-ation more complete information about the graph, they are often computationally expensive."}

{"text": "Consider a robot given a coverage task on a building floor. For example, it could be tasked with performing a safety inspection or collecting data. With the increasing availability and use of high-resolution sensors such as cameras and LiDAR, such tasks require the robot to process highdimensional observations for real-time decisions. Current navigation approaches typically involve constructing and utilizing a high-fidelity map of the robot's environment [1, 2, 3, 4] . However, is a map necessary for the task? Does the map-based representation satisfy the robot's onboard memory constraints? Are there representations that are more memory efficient? These fundamental and practical questions motivate the need to have principled methods for finding memory representations that are not only sufficient for the task at hand but also reduce the robot's memory requirements.\nIn order to illustrate the potential benefits of memory-efficient policies, consider a robot tasked with covering an n × n maze (a simplified version of the building floor coverage task). Blum and Kozen [5] show that there is a control policy -a clever, handcrafted, wall-following and zigzagging routine -that only utilizes O(log n) bits of memory. This policy thus requires significantly less memory than one that relies on building and using a map of the environment (a map-building strategy requires at least O(n 2 ) memory). Beyond memory efficiency, such a policy also affords additional important advantages including (i) computational efficiency, and (ii) improved generalization/robustness. For example, Blum and Kozen's policy does not need to perform real-time computations with the entire map as an input. Additionally, a policy that requires O(log n) memory is inherently task-centric; irrelevant geometric details of the environment (e.g., the exact positions or colors of obstacles in the environment) do not affect the robot's behavior. The policy can thus be highly robust to uncertainty or noise in these task-irrelevant features.\nAn important feature of memory-efficient policies is that they can be qualitatively different from ones that utilize map-based representations. As a simple example, consider the navigation problem demonstrated in Figure 1 . A policy that chooses to follow the wall can be significantly The paths on the floor illustrate the policies found by a standard policy gradient (PG) method (solid orange) and the approach presented here (dotted blue). The latter (wall-following) policy is significantly more memory efficient and is also robust to changes to the distribution of obstacle colors. more memory-efficient than one that navigates through the environment diagonally (since the wallfollowing strategy does not need to maintain information pertaining to obstacle locations). This motivates the need to jointly synthesize the memory representation and the control policy; such a joint synthesis can lead to policies that actively reduce memory requirements.\nStatement of Contributions. The goal of this paper is to synthesize low-dimensional, task-centric memory representations and control policies.

{"text": "Recently, semantic communication has been widely believed to be one of the core technologies for the sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks because of its high communication efficiency [1] . Compared with the current research on communication which focuses on transmitting mapped bit sequences of the raw message [2] - [4] , semantic communication systems transmit compacted semantic features. Existing literature in semantic communication mainly exploits the deep learning (DL) techniques to extract the semantic features from the raw message. For instance, Han et al. [5] proposed to extract the text-related features from the speech signal as the semantic features and remove the redundant content. On the receiver's side, the semantic features can be reconstructed by a deep learning model into the original message or directly applied for downstream tasks such as image classification and speech recognition.\nAlthough many works have been proposed for semantic communication considering different aspects, few studies have taken into account the security problems [6] - [8] . Tung et al. [6] proposed to encrypt the transmitted signal in semantic communication, but the encryption algorithm incurs a large computation overhead. Security is crucial in semantic communication for two main reasons. Firstly, semantic communication is more prone to privacy leakage compared to traditional communication. In traditional communication systems, the bit sequences being transmitted contain redundant bits to ensure reliable transmission, which can be used to provide a certain level of privacy protection. However, the semantic communication systems transmit compact and more semantic-related symbols which may reveal more private information. Secondly, deeplearning-based semantic communication may be vulnerable to attacks targeting DL models. Extensive studies have been conducted on attacks on the DL model, a review of which can be referred to [9] . If the semantic features being transmitted are eavesdropped by a malicious attacker, the attacker can reconstruct the raw message by utilizing the DL-based attack techniques. The attacker can also add perturbation to the transmitted data, causing the semantic communication system to make incorrect decisions on downstream tasks. For example, Sagduyu et al. [7] proposed a multi-domain evasion attack to cause the semantic communication system to make incorrect classifications, which is achieved by introducing noises to input images or the semantic features. Du et al. [8] proposed a semantic data poisoning attack, which causes the receiver to receive irrelevant messages from the transmitter."}

{"text": "Old Master paintings are often the subject of detailed technical examination, whether to investigate an artist's materials and technique or in support of conservation or restoration treatments. In recent years, the technical examination of paintings has undergone a major digital revolution, with the widespread adoption of cutting-edge analytical and imaging technologies, generating large and typically multi-dimensional datasets [1] - [3] .\nWhile they have a long history of use, traditional Xradiographs (X-ray images) still play a vital role in informing the technical study, conservation, and preservation of artworks in cultural heritage institutions due to the ability of X-rays to penetrate deep into a painting's stratigraphy [4] , [5] . They can help to establish the condition of a painting (e.g., losses and damages not apparent at the surface), the status of different paint passages (e.g., to identify retouching, fills or other conservation interventions) or provide information about the painting support (e.g., type of canvas or the construction of a canvas or panel). X-ray images also provide insight into how the artist built up the different paint layers, thus revealing pentimenti -changes made by the artist during paintingwhich may include concealed earlier designs that were painted over when the artist revised the design or if the painting support was reused by the artist. There are many such artworks with concealed paintings with research from the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam showing that 20 of 130 paintings by Van Gogh, i.e., nearly 15%, contained concealed paintings [6] .\nTherefore, in order to improve the understanding of the artworks and artists' working practice, there is a lot of interest in the ability to derive clearer visualisations of such hidden designs. Some works have proposed approaches leveraging various imaging modalities to enhance visualisation of concealed images in paintings [7] , improve imaging of underdrawings [8] - [11] or help reveal overwritten texts such as those found in palimpsests. X-ray image separation approaches have been proposed in a series of works such as [14] - [18] . However, such approaches apply to double-sided painting panels where -in addition to the mixed X-ray image -one also has access to two RGB (visible) images associated with the front and back sides of the artwork.\nThe approach described in the current paper applies instead to a much more challenging scenario where one has access only to the mixed X-ray image (Fig. 1 b ) plus a single RGB image associated with the visible portion of the painting (Fig. 1 (a) )."}
{"text": "A key challenge in integrating autonomous vehicles into the transportation infrastructure is ensuring their safe operation in the presence of potential hazards, such as humanoperated vehicles and pedestrians. However, tracking the paths of these safety-critical targets using on-board sensors is difficult in urban environments due to the presence of occlusions. Collaborative estimation among networked autonomous vehicles has the potential to alleviate the limitations of each vehicle's individual perception capabilities. Networked fleets of autonomous vehicles operating in urban environments can collectively improve the safety of their planning and decision-making by collaboratively tracking the trajectories of nearby vehicles in real-time.\nConstraints on communication and computation impose fundamental challenges on collaborative tracking. Given limited communication bandwidth, information communicated between vehicles must be succinct and actionable. Communication channels must also be free to form and dissolve responsively given the highly dynamic nature of urban traffic. Relying on centralized computation is neither robust to single points of failure, nor communication-efficient in disseminating information to those vehicles to whom it is relevant. Rather, a fully-distributed scheme that exploits the computational and communication resources of an autonomous fleet is crucial to reliable tracking. *This project was funded in part by DARPA YFA award D18AP00064, NSF NRI award 1830402.

{"text": "Contemporary machine learning (ML) researchers predominantly use high-level programming languages and frameworks to conduct their studies. Python is the principal programming language in ML, leading to the widespread adoption of frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, often coupled with NumPy. In this paper, we want to study the statistical quality, reproducibility, energy and time consumption of the pseudo random number generation in these technologies. The literature on the quality of Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) within ML technologies remains sparse; our investigation addresses this gap.\nIn Python, the default PRNG algorithm used is Mersenne Twister (MT) (Matsumoto & Nishimura, 1998) . In TensorFlow, the default PRNG algorithm is Philox (Threefry from the same family of crypto secure generator is also available) (Salmon et al., 2011) , similarly to PyTorch. NumPy offers a variety of PRNGs, and thus more flexibility. The default PRNG algorithm proposed by NumPy is PCG (O'neill, 2014) . For our study, we check and compare reproducibility, performance, statistical quality and energy consumption, for the following PRNGs: MT, Philox, PCG and Mrg32k3a (L'ecuyer, 1999) as a reference. We use the original C implementations provided by the PRNGs authors.\nAs described in (Antunes & Hill, 2023) , Salmon et al. introduced the Philox, Threefry and ARS algorithms at the 2011 Supercomputing Conference, they incorporate cryptographic techniques akin to AES (Daemen & Rijmen, 2000) . Although their cryptographic nature makes them relatively slow, their statistical properties are commendable, albeit with some reproducibility issues (Li, 2012) . MRG32k3a, devised by L'Ecuyer in 1999, is a combined recursive pseudo-random number generator chosen specifically since it was built to obtain the best statistical results when faced to TestU01, the most complete statistical test battery developed to assess PRNGs (L'ecuyer & Simard, 2007) . This software proposes more than 100 tests at the \"big Crush\" level, it will be discussed below. MRG32k3a can be significantly slower than the famous Mersenne Twister, 15 to 20 times slower when comparing optimized C implementations. PCG, developed in 2014 by O'Neill, is touted for its superior statistical attributes compared to other generators, this could not be confirmed with a thorough TestU01 campaign. The initial Mersenne Twister generator was introduced in 1998 by Matsumoto and Nishimura, it has known limits but is renowned for its long period. Its 2002 iteration improved its initialization. SFMT version, designed by Saito & Matsumoto in 2006 , capitalizes on modern processor capabilities and offers twice more speed and even superior statistical qualities. A GP-GPU version was proposed and is known as MTGP. However, it is important to note that the Mersenne Twister family is not apt for cryptographic applications."}

Topological correctness is fundamental for facilitating downstream tasks such as analyzing blood flow dynamics, delineating neuronal boundaries in Electron Microscopy imagery, evaluating risk factors for vascular pathologies, aiding in surgical planning, and optimizing route planning [1, 5, 6, 21, 32, 40] . Classical approaches for the automated segmentation of thin curvilinear structures have encompassed methods including image transforms [25, 34] , mathematical morphologies [29, 41] , filtering [10, 13, 15] , differential operators [33] , among others [2, 3, 8, 16, 19] . Deep learning based techniques have played an increasing role in recent years with standard segmentation networks such as UNet [27] being popular. Standard overlap-based losses (eg. dice-similarity coefficient [43] ) enable such networks to segment large structures while often struggling with small elongated ones [18] as shown in Fig. 2 .\nMultiple methods have been introduced in recent years to address the challenges of segmenting thin curvilinear structures but are often domain-specific or require the use of specialized networks [4, 9, 17, [22] [23] [24] 39] . Recently, center-lineDice [31] (clDice) was introduced encompassing both a loss function and a metric for measuring connectivity in segmentation of thin structures. Effectively, it incorporates the skeleton of a segmentation into the dice calculation. While the clDice metric uses the exact skeleton, the clDice loss works with a differentiable approximation of the skeleton."}

The article doesn't state this material, but in order to make these cars so that they are drivelss, it would cost a lot more money than making an ordinary car.

{"text": "Web application attacks are found one of the most targets by attackers. Symantec Internet security [9] reported an interesting statistics that 1 in 10 URLs are identified as being malicious. Web applications typically use the HTTP/HTTPS protocols supported by other backend and frontend interfaces. According to Imperva Web Application Vulnerability Report [9] , high severity attacks are injection attacks, which are being exploited through injecting payloads in HTTP/HTTPS web queries by using GET, POST and PUT methods. CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) attack, SQL injection attack, XSS (Cross Site Scripts) attacks, and widely used vulnerable JS libraries, which account for 51 percent, 27 percent, 33 percent and 36 percent, respectively. This paper focuses on the most frequent types of web-based injection attacks, which includes SQL injection, XSS (Cross Site Script), RFI (Remote File Inclusion), XXE (XML External Entity), CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery), and SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery). Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) monitors the network traffic in web applications. Web IDS acts as intermediate between web application and users, as it analyzes web traffics to detect any anomaly or malicious activity [2] . Generally, there are two types of detection approaches: anomaly-based detection and signature-based detection. The signature-based IDS system uses a signature concept, more like antivirus detects the virus, when the antivirus database has that specific kind of virus signature. If attackers create new virus, the antivirus is of no use if the signature/pattern is not present. Anomaly-based detection is based on detection unique behavior pattern recognition or any activity that differs from previous data or information is fed. When comparing signature-based detection method with anomaly-based detection method, the performance of anomaly based detection found high to detect the unknown attacks, but it comes with a cost that it has problem with false positive alarm rates. After detection of an anomaly it is stored in the database it becomes a \"signature\", and furthermore, there are two detection methods which come under anomaly detection which is adaptive detection and constant detection [3] . An adaptive detection algorithm analyzes the network traffic of port 80 of web network that is HTTP traffic, which continuously gets the input of traffic and analyzes in a timely manner, while constant based detection method analyzes stores incoming traffic or use to analyze the logs of collected traffic. The conventional patching approach to mitigating most network layer vulnerabilities does not work well in web application vulnerabilities such as SQLi, RCE, or XSS. The reason behind all these attacks is that modern web applications are poorly designed with insecure coding. One can follow the OWASP's secure coding guidelines to prevent most of the attacks. Adaptive detection model is effective to detect anomalies and classify them which type of attack it is, so that the developer at backend can fix that patch or prevent it (e.g., Django uses CSRF Tokens in the framework to prevent CSRF) attacks which account for 51 percent of the web attack. At the same time, the model should learn the patterns over time to detect unknown web attacks and identify which type of attack vectors are being exploited. Anomaly based detection approaches [2] usually rely on an adaptive model to identify anomalous web requests, but with a high degree of false positive rate. In this paper, we come up with a solution to handle false positive where IDS monitor a system based on their behavior pattern. There are several reasons why a conventional IDS or web application firewall does not work, as follows:"}

{"text": "Transient simulation is a powerful tool for studying dynamic behavior of power systems [1] - [4] . For stability studies, a transient simulation run is typically required to start from the steady state [3] , [4] . Furthermore, power flow conditions are also to be satisfied, which characterize the operating point of the system [3] , [4] . The initialization process of transient simulation for stability studies has to meet these requirements.\nFor three-phase balanced power systems, initialization process is mature and available in the literature [3] , [4] . Nevertheless that for general unbalanced power systems is much more complicated and difficult to achieve [1] , [5] . Power flow computation [3] , [4] and the multiphase version [6] are no longer applicable due to the presence of harmonics [7] . Time domain techniques for steady state computation have been applied to power systems [8] , [9] ; however the power flow conditions were not considered. How to initialize a possibly unbalanced power system is also a huge challenge encountered by the novel transient simulation scheme proposed in an earlier work of the authors [10] , which is based on frequency response optimized integrators considering second order derivative and especially suitable for stability studies on general unbalanced power systems.\nIn fact, initialization process for unbalanced power systems may be linked to the \"time-domain harmonic powerflow algorithm\" proposed in [11] . Based on the sensitivity circuit analysis [12] , [11] formulates a problem aiming at obtaining the steady state solution for general power systems so that the state variables are periodic regarding the nominal fundamental period while the power flow conditions are satisfied. That paper then uses Newton's method to solve the problem. The Jacobian matrix is constructed by the finite difference method at the first iteration; it is updated with Broyden's method in the later iterations. The initial guess of the unknowns is done by a flat start. This paper further develops the work of [11] to put forward the initialization process of the novel transient simulation scheme [10] . Contributions of this paper are threefold. First, the initial value condition is added to account for variables which cannot be periodic regarding the nominal fundamental period."}

{"text": "A new strain of game theory -Compositional Game Theory (CGT) -was introduced recently [9] . At its core, CGT involves a completely new representation of games -open games -with operators for constructing larger and more complex games from smaller, simpler (and hence easier to reason about) ones. Despite recent substantial interest and further development [13, 10, 7, 6, 4, 11, 14] , open games remain complex structures, e.g. the simplest form of an open game is an 8-tuple consisting of 4 ports, a set of strategies, play and coplay functions and an equilibrium predicate. More advanced versions [4] require sophisticated structures such as coends. This causes problems: (i) complex definitions lead to complex and even error prone proofs; (ii) proofs are programs and overly complex proofs turn into overly complex programs; (iii) even worse, this complexity deters experimentation and innovation, for instance the authors of [10] were deterred from trying alternative definitions as the work became prohibitive; and (iv) worse still, this complexity suggests we do not fully understand the mathematical structure of open games.\nCategory theorists have an answer to such complexity: trade complex definitions in a simple category for simpler definitions in a more complex category. This simplified open games by factoring their definition via the category of lenses, and this more abstract perspective led directly to the discovery of Bayesian Open Games [4] where one naturally swaps out lenses in favour of optics when one starts with a monoidal category. Swapping out a subcomponent for another is a hallmark of compositionality, but, because the definition of open games is not compositional, one has to redevelop all the structure of open games built over optics from scratch. The same thing happens with open games with mixed strategies [10] where a small change -here to the type of the equilibrium predicate -leads to the need to redevelop the full theory of these open games. The same story is true if we want to (i) replace equilibria with best-response; or (ii) add type dependency; or (iii) allow the covariant play function and contravariant co-play function to live in different categories; or (iv) build open games over monadic effects; or (v) consider a host of other variations of open games. Every single time we must show from scratch that a given variant of open game forms a monoidal category -a highly non-trivial task.\nWe present a compositional approach to CGT which allows us exactly to make small modifications to the definition of an open game, check these modifications have suitable local properties, and conclude the resulting open games do indeed form a monoidal category. As with compositionality in general, we start with a semantic structure and define operators to build more complex examples from smaller ones. The semantic structure we use is a presentation of monoidal categories using profunctors and Arrows [17] . This simplifies the treatment of the monoidal structure to that of a strength, and also allows us to work in a purely functorial setting."}

However, most existing models are computa-Proceedings of the 39 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Baltimore, Maryland, USA, PMLR 162, 2022. Copyright 2022 by the author(s). tionally extensive and overparameterized, thus it is difficult to deploy these models in real-world devices. To address this issue, many efforts in direction of knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015b) , quantization (Hubara et al., 2018) , and pruning (LeCun et al., 1989) , have been devoted to compressing the heavy model into a lightweight counterpart. Among them, network pruning (LeCun et al., 1990; Han et al., 2015a; b; Li et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2019; Frankle & Carbin, 2018) , which identifies sparse sub-networks (aka. sparse mask) by removing unnecessary connections, stands as one of the most effective methods.\nRecently, a significant amount of research efforts have been focused towards developing increasingly sophisticated and efficient pruning algorithms (Lee et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020; Frankle & Carbin, 2018; Frankle et al., 2019; Tanaka et al., 2020) , to identify the sparse mask of the original dense model at the initialization, and then train only the sparse subnetwork from scratch, such as lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) (Frankle & Carbin, 2018; Frankle et al., 2019) , SNIP (Lee et al., 2018) , GraSP (Wang et al., 2020) , Syn-Flow (Tanaka et al., 2020) , and even random pruning (Su et al., 2020; Frankle et al., 2020) . In most (if not all) cases, sparse masks obtained by various those pruning algorithms are trained using the same training protocols optimized for dense neural network training. However, till now it is still under-explored and unclear if dense training protocols are optimal for training a sparse mask from scratch too. We hence ask: Should training a sparse neural network requires atypical treatment and its own set of training toolkit or not?"}

{"text": "Deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved state-of-the-art performance when both train and test sets share the same distribution. However, domain shift, i.e. change in data distribution between train (source domain) and test (target domain) sets, significantly deteriorates the generalizability [1, 2] . This issue is particularly pronounced in multi-center medical studies, where various imaging centers employ different scanners, protocols, and subject populations [2, 3] .\nUnsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) [1, 2] aims to generalize large-scale models, pre-trained on the source domain to an unlabeled target domain, eliminating the need for costly data annotation. It is typically achieved through fine-tuning, where a model pre-trained on the source domain is adapted to target domains. However, a major downside of fine-tuning is that it results in a dedicated model for each target domain with the same parameters as the original pre-trained model [4, 5] . Consequently, several target domains would require several dedicated models with the same parameter count as the original pre-trained model.\nThus UDA methods can be effective for single-target DA, resulting in a single model for a specific target domain. Conversely, in multi-target DA (MTDA) the objective is to adapt to multiple unlabeled target domains. MTDA has a broader applicability to real-world scenarios. However, training separate models for each target domain with the same trainable parameters as the source model is impractical and prohibitively expensive.\nParameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has demonstrated its effectiveness as a fine-tuning strategy for Large Language Models (LLMs) [6] . Unlike conventional fine-tuning, it keeps the majority of the model parameters frozen while adapting a substantially reduced number of parameters, often less than 5% of the total. This enables both efficient learning and faster updates. PEFT also outperforms full fine-tuning and enhances generalization, particularly in low-data scenarios [6] .\nIn the field of medical imaging, only a few methods have used adapter-based PEFT in Transformer-based architectures [7, 8] . These works focus on achieving parameter-efficient transfer learning from natural images to medical images. To the best of our knowledge, both the application of PEFT in medical imaging in the context of UDA, and the use of adapterbased methods in CNNs have not yet been explored [9] .\nHaving identified this research gap, we propose a novel parameter-efficient MT UDA for medical image segmentation, that is computationally efficient and also has low-memory footprint. First, we propose Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (ConvLoRA), as an adaptation of Low-Rank Domain Adaptation (LoRA) in LLMs [4] ."}
{"text": "Despite mathematical elegance and some promising results restricted to simple models, standard stochastic gradient (SG) methods for MCMC-based Bayesian posterior sampling Welling and Teh [2011] , Ahn et al. [2012] , Patterson and Teh [2013] , Chen et al. [2014] , Ma et al. [2015] fall short in dealing with the complexity of the loss landscape of deep models Draxler et al. [2018] , Garipov et al. [2018] , for which stochastic optimization poses serious challenges Chaudhari and Soatto [2018] , Maddox et al. [2019] . Moreover, existing methods are often unpractical, as they require ad-hoc, sophisticated vanishing learning rate schedules, and hyper-parameter tuning.\nIn general, SG-MCMC algorithms inject random noise to SG descent algorithms: the covariance of such noise and the learning rate are tightly related to the assumptions on the loss landscape, which together with the SG noise, determine their sampling properties Ma et al. [2015] . However, current SG-MCMC algorithms applied to popular complex models such as Deep Nets, cannot satisfy the simplifying assumptions on loss landscapes and on the behavior of the SG noise covariance, while operating with practical requirements, such as non-vanishing learning rates and ease of use. A recent work Mandt et al. [2017] argues for fixed step sizes, but settles for variational approximations of simple quadratic losses. In a generic Bayesian deep learning setting, none of the existing implementations of SG-MCMC methods converge to the true posterior without learning rate annealing.\nWhile we are not the first to highlight these issues Draxler et al. [2018] , Garipov et al. [2018] , including the lack of a unified notation [Ma et al., 2015] , we believe that studying the role of noise in SG-MCMC algorithms has not received enough attention, and a deeper understanding is truly desirable, as it can clarify how various methods compare. Most importantly, this endeavor can suggest novel and more practical algorithms relying on fewer tunable parameters and less restrictive assumptions.\nIn this work, we present a mathematical framework that emphasizes the role of SG noise covariance and learning rate on the behavior of SG-MCMC algorithms (Sec. 2). As a result, the equivalence between learning rate annealing and the injection of noise with extremely large variance becomes clear, and this allows us to propose a novel, practical SG-MCMC algorithm (Sec. 3) that produces (approximate) posterior samples with a fixed, easy to derive, learning rate. Furthermore, our approach can be readily applied to pre-trained models: after a \"warm-up\" phase to compute SG noise estimates, it can efficiently perform Bayesian posterior sampling. The proposed SG-MCMC method is a valid, theoretically sound, and simple alternative to popular techniques, that have shortcomings when it comes to the assumptions they rely on Gal and Ghahramani [2016] ."}

{"text": "The Union Minister of State for Education, Subhas Sarkar, told the Rajya Sabha on November 22 that there are 3,900 vacant teaching posts and more than 3,000 ad-hoc teachers working in colleges under the University of Delhi currently. The ad hoc teachers' issue has been one at the forefront of almost every movement the DU Teachers' Association has been leading for the past few years but has not reached a resolution yet.\nThe Centre in its reply to a question at the Lok Sabha in August had said that there are 58 ad hoc teachers in DU. So how did it suddenly jump to 3,000? Well, the data presented in August was only of the departments at the university and not the constituent affiliated colleges. But this figure too, is not right, said Dr Shabana Azmi, an ad hoc teacher of Political Science at the Zakir Husain College, who contested the recently concluded DUTA elections. \"According to the electoral rolls, there are more than 4,000 ad hoc teachers, not 3,000. We have to analyse how the government came up with the number,\" she added.\nAd hoc teachers have been demanding absorption for ages now and we have seen the left-led DUTA fight for it. But Dr Azmi feels that it wasn't enough. \"None of the teachers' groups really fought for our cause. Even in the recent Executive Council (EC) meeting, they presented the issue along with 22 others and it got trampled. We need to raise this issue together and strongly,\" added Dr Azmi, a member of the Adhoc Teachers Front(ATF). \"While we did not have permanent jobs, the permanent faculty got promotions and we were previously told that there aren't any modalities for absorption. Why do rules and modalities come up when it's about us?\" she asked.\nThe ad hoc teachers are now afraid of even appearing for interviews as they claimed that there have been instances where the ad hoc teachers have been completely or majorly displaced from their posts and new recruits have been taken in for those posts. They also raised the issue of having a PhD as a criterion for marking. \"There are so many of us who have been embroiled in the job so much that they've not been able to finish their PhD. The minimum requirement used to be a Masters' degree,\" said Dr Azmi.\nWhat's the way out? The ad hoc teachers plan to approach the DUTA, the concerned officials and the ministry first before they go on a full-blown protest like in 2019."}

{"text": "Quantum machine learning aims to use quantum computers to enhance the power of machine learning [1, 2] . One possible route to quantum advantage in machine learning is the use of quantum embedding kernels [3] [4] [5] [6] , where quantum computers are used to encode data in ways that are difficult for classical machine learning methods [7] [8] [9] . Noisy intermediate scale quantum computers [10, 11] may be capable of solving tasks difficult for classical computers [12, 13] and have shown promise in running proof-of-principle quantum machine learning applications [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . However, currently available quantum computers are at least 6 orders of magnitude orders slower than classical computers. Furthermore, running quantum computers is comparatively expensive, necessitating methods to reduce quantum resources above all else. Thus, it is important to develop better methods to run and benchmark noisy quantum computers. Here, several bottlenecks limit quantum hardware for machine learning in practice. First, the quantum cost of measuring quantum kernels with conventional methods scales quadratically with the size of the training dataset [5] . This quadratic scaling is a severe restriction, as commonly machine learning relies on large amounts of data.

{"text": "While great progress has been made in adversarial attacks [3, 6, 16, 41] , the fundamental reason why convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are fragile to small perturbations is still unclear [25, 33, 4, 44, 32] . State-of-the-art models generate perturbations that seem like statistical noise that affect both high and low image scales (similar to high and low frequency). We believe that the inability to localize an attack becomes a key limitation of time-domain attacks as they end up modifying unnecessary or unrelated information in the image [20, 2] . Thus, instead of generating adversarial attacks in the time domain (low and high frequencies), we propose to expose a new vulnerability of deep learning models by generating fine structural-perturbations in meaningful image content in the high scale Wavelet decomposition. Studies have shown that early convolution layers capture low-level edge and edge orientation information possibly similar to receptive fields of human vision [19, 49] . We aim to induce a perturbation that will alter the local vertical, horizontal, and diagonal edge content of images, therefore, creating arbitrary activation spikes in early convolution layers. We argue that decomposing and isolating localized coherent spatial arrangements is an effective mechanism for disrupting CNN layer responses."}

{"text": "When low-resolution images are zoomed using upscaling techniques such as Lanczos resampling and interpolation, they become pixelated instead of providing more information. Super Resolution (SR) is an image processing technique that generates a higher resolution image from single or multiple low-resolution (LR) input images. Super\nResolution aims at adding pixel density and high-frequency content (such as textures and edges) in the LR image. SR finds tremendous utility in areas where attention to detail is of utmost importance. Some of these include medical imagery, forensic analysis of surveillance feeds, satellite images, biometric systems, and person identification, etc. This paper specifically focuses on the use of SR algorithms in offline forensic analysis of surveillance feeds. Due to its inherent nature, the surveillance environment mostly has uncontrolled and sporadic dynamics. Furthermore, the quality of a surveillance feed is affected by factors such as occlusions, type of camera hardware, camera pose, limited bandwidth, varying illumination conditions, and background complexity. These factors affect the process of identifying and monitoring individuals and various related activities in the surveillance feeds. Therefore, acquiring a generic model for varying surveillance environments is a complex task. For the proposed research work, we have inspected the effectiveness of four conventional, yet effective vision-based and three deep learning-based SR algorithms. The objective of this research work is to seek the finest method that executes well in a surveillance environment with limited training data options. To relate limited training data available for a specific surveillance environment a subset of 220 images from 6 different public datasets was selected along with some test images acquired from local settings."}

There are still issues that the car can't handle on it's own and will require the driver to take over. Driverless cars can be very dangerous because if the car would ever require the driver, and it fails to alert the driver in time, there could be fatal consequences. Drunk drivers could also try to take advantage of the fact that the car would be driverless and have the car drive itself.

{"text": "3D object detection, as a fundamental task in computer vision and robotics, has been extensively studied with the development of autonomous driving and intelligent transportation. Currently, LiDAR sensor is widely used for perception tasks because it can provide accurate range measurements of the surrounding environment, especially for the obstacles such as vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists, etc. With the development of the deep learning techniques on point-cloud based representation, many LiDAR-based 3D object detection approaches have been developed. Generally, these approaches can be categorized into point-based [1] and voxelbased [2] , [3] methods. LiDAR sensors have the superiority of providing distance information of the obstacles, even though the detailed geometry is often lost due to its sparse scanning and furthermore texture and color information can be not captured. Therefore, False Positive (FP) detection and wrong categories classification often happen for LiDARbased object detection solutions.\n{xushaoqing, zhoudingfu, fangjin, liangjun zhang}@baidu.com {xsq0226,binzhou}@buaa.edu.cn *Corresponding author. On the contrary, the camera sensors can provide detailed texture and color information with high resolution, though the depth has been lost during the perspective projection based imaging procedure. The combination of the two different types of sensors of LiDAR and camera is a promising way for boosting the performance of autonomous driving perception. In literature, multi-modal based object detection approaches can be divided into as early fusion [4] , [5] , deep fusion [6] - [8] and late fusion approaches [9] . Early fusion approaches aim at creating a new type of data by combining the raw data directly before sending them into the detection framework. Usually, these kinds of methods require pixellevel correspondence between each type sensor data. Different from the early fusion methods, late fusion approaches execute the detection for each type of data separately first and then fuse the detection results in the bounding box level. Different from the above two methods, deep fusionbased methods usually extract the features with different types of deep neural networks first and then fuse them at the features level. As a simple yet effective sequential fusion method, PointPainting [5] has achieved superior detection results on different benchmarks. This approach employees the 2D image semantic segmentation results from an offthe-shelf neural network first and then adds them into a point-cloud-based 3D object detection based on the 2D-3D projection. The superiority of PointPainting suggests that 2D image segmentation approach can be used for providing the semantic results and it can be incorporated into any 3D object detectors even point-based or voxel-based approaches.\nHowever, the boundary-blurring effect often happens in image-based semantic segmentation methods due to the relatively low resolution of the deep feature map. This effect becomes much more severe after re-projecting them into the 3D point cloud. An example of the reprojected 2D result into 3D is shown in sub-fig. 1-(a) . Taking the big truck at the bottom of the image as an example, we can find that there is a large frustum area of the background (e.g, points in orange color) that has been miss-classified as foreground due to the inaccurate segmentation results in the 2D image. In addition, the correspondence of 3D points to 2D image pixels is not exactly a one-to-one projection due to the digital quantization problem, and many-to-one projection issues. An interesting phenomenon is that the segmentation from the 3D point cloud (e.g., sub-fig. 1-(b )) performs much better on the boundary of obstacles.

{"text": "Inside a baseball stadium at 35th and Shields getting a new name, watching the White Sox introduce a new manager Monday, everything felt the same about an organization oblivious to being stuck in neutral.\nRick Renteria, remarkably the only candidate the Sox considered to replace Robin Ventura, was Ventura's bench coach on a 78-84 team general manager Rick Hahn labeled underachieving. Renteria got the job anyway. After four straight losing seasons, the Sox hired the latest right-hand man of the manager who presided over all the futility.\nSuffice to say this change in direction isn't exactly going to break the Sox compass.\nA class act through his final news conference Sunday, Ventura simply had to go and made it easy on his bosses, who clumsily went out of their way to make sure everybody — most notably USA Today — knew this exit was the manager's idea. Hahn used the word bittersweet to describe Ventura's departure. After the lamest of lame-duck seasons, overdue was a more apt description.\nAs Hahn extolled the virtues of Renteria, a baseball lifer whose likability in the game rivals Ventura's, he mentioned something about the appeal of making a seamless transition. Really? Mediocre teams shouldn't seek seamless transitions; they need drastic changes. Nothing about hiring Renteria suggests to long-suffering fans those are imminent. Naturally, Hahn disputed that notion.\n\"I don't view hiring a guy who's been here for a year, and quite frankly is the best candidate on the market, as a triumph for continuity,'' Hahn said in the interview room at U.S. Cellular Field, soon to be renamed Guaranteed Rate Field. \"It's kind of nice when you have the best candidate in-house. We weren't about to look away from the best candidate simply because he already was here.''\nNobody ever will know because Hahn's short list included one name. The Sox began discussing the job with Renteria a month ago after Ventura first broached the idea of stepping down at the end of the season. Hahn acted quickly, guessing it was \"a near-certainty somebody would snatch (Renteria) up to be a manager in 2017.'' Truth is, hiring Renteria this swiftly with no search makes Hahn's the hottest seat in the organization.\nThe Sox considered Renteria, 54, managerial material for several years. He indeed might have emerged as the most qualified manager, but why not interview intriguing possibilities such as Bud Black, Sandy Alomar Jr., Dave Martinez or a manager who unexpectedly hits the job market like Joe Maddon did for the Cubs in 2014? What was the Sox's hurry? The reality is likely nothing would have changed. But by embracing the status quo candidate they targeted, the Sox fed the perception that they are another Reinsdorf organization averse to change. Close your eyes and change the sports, and Hahn sounded like Bulls general manager Gar Forman did the day he hired Fred Hoiberg.\n\"We were very confident we weren't going to find anybody better,'' Hahn said.\nSay this for Renteria: Cubs President Theo Epstein once picked him to manage his team, perhaps his most impressive credential. The bilingual former Cubs manager, who was dumped after one season because Maddon became available, vowed to bring more intensity to the Sox and get the most out of players he got to know this year. He also admirably continued to take the high road when reflecting on his brief tenure with the Cubs.\n\"My time with the Cubs was good, actually,'' Renteria said. \"We were able to do a lot with the players."}

{"text": "Over the past several decades, the emergence of big data and machine learning workloads has given rise to massive data-driven applications. These applications, which include large language models [1] , intrusion detection systems [2] , and graph processing frameworks [3] , [4] , consume and generate data at unprecedented rates, requiring data storage in the order of terabytes (TB) and memory bandwidths in the order of TB/s. Conventional electronic memory technologies such as dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) are struggling to keep up with such demands for increasingly higher bandwidth [6] and energy efficiency [7] . Additionally, DRAM technology also faces challenges associated with scaling towards the 10-nm technology node. Current DRAM nodes, such as Micron's 1α and 1β, are fabricated at 12-14 nm. At lower node scales, it has been shown that the DRAM cell's charge retention diminishes, cell structural integrity deteriorates, and delay and power penalties associated with bit lines increase dramatically [6] . While 3D-stacking technologies and through silicon vias have enabled high bandwidth memory (HBM), the increasing demand for capacity, throughput, and energy efficiency warrants the exploration of new main memory technologies.\nNon-volatile memories (NVMs) address the data retention challenges in DRAMs and can help avoid the need for refreshes and associated latency concerns. But NVM candidates based on ferroelectric (FRAM) [8] and resistive metal oxide (RRAM) [9] technologies generally suffer from reliability and write endurance issues. To achieve higher reliability while retaining the advantages that NVMs offer, NVMs based on phase change materials (PCMs) can be considered [10] - [12] . PCM cells show higher energy efficiency, bit densities, and bandwidth than other NVM cell types [13] , [14] . PCMs can transition between two material states: amorphous and crystalline. These states offer high resistance contrast between them and hence can be used to store data as resistance levels. In electrically controlled PCM (EPCM) cells, the phase transitions are brought about by using current pulses."}
{"text": "We study constrained stochastic optimization\nEQUATION\nwhere X is a closed convex subset of R d , ξ is a random variable following an unknown distribution D, and F (•) is possibly non-convex in x. Our central structural assumption about (1) is that it admits a convex reformulation of the form\nEQUATION\nwhere H(•) is a convex function defined on a closed convex set U ⊂ R d , and c : X → U is an invertible map (with its inverse denoted by c -1 (•)). This property is often referred to as hidden convexity and frequently appears in various modern applications, for example, policy optimization in convex reinforcement learning and optimal control [92, 80] , generative models [50] , supply chain and revenue management [36, 15] , training neural networks [83, 30] . In the optimization literature, hidden convexity has been identified much earlier and dates back to at least 1990s in the context of quadratic optimization [78, 8] . Since then, several works have developed various tools to identify such property [7, 6] . More recently, hidden convexity has been established for a wider classes of non-convex programs [81, 84, 14] and for non-monotone games [82, 62] , to name just a few. Despite the existence of the convex reformulation, the transformation function c(•) is usually hard to compute or even unknown, and one cannot readily solve the convex reformulation. This motivates the use of (sub-) gradient methods that optimize F (•) directly over the variable x ∈ X . Perhaps, the most basic algorithm is the projected stochastic (sub-) gradient method (SM)."}

{"text": "Harvesting ocean waves energy has become more prominent since the oil crisis in 1973. Ocean energy has huge potential in providing energy especially for coastal communities, which made the governments, industries and engineers very attracted to this matter and resulted in more than 1000 patents worldwide [1, 2] . Wave energy has immense reserves, high power potential, higher power density than solar and wind energy, is geographically diverse and makes small interference in the environment [3, 4] .\nOne of the key parts of a WEC is the power take-off system which converts the mechanical energy absorbed by the device into electrical energy [5, 3] . Since the wave energy is fluctuating by nature, regular PTOs are not very effective at absorbing wave power [i31] . The development of hydraulic PTO systems has been a huge breakthrough in the field of ocean energy applications, due to the fast-frequency response, easy and high controllability, high efficiency, hydraulic overload protection, and adaptability to high power and low-frequency of the HPTO systems [5, 3, 6] . These characteristics made HPTO the best PTO type for the point absorber wave energy devices, which can reach up to 90% efficiency [6] . There has been an increasing number of studies about the HPTO application in different WECs in recent years [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] , but the number of studies is still lower than the studies WECs with Linear PTO, and there are a lot of unexplored areas that need to be addressed in the future. Most of these studies investigated the performance and efficiency of the HPTO systems, but they did not consider the effect of HPTO model parameters. These parameters are really important because they affect the unit's efficiency and power output. Only a small number of studies addressed this problem, especially the effect of simultaneous change in the HPTO parameters has been investigated in very few studies, for example in [12, 6] ."}

{"text": "I was six when I first realized that I could see the knot in people, black and twisted and hanging there in the middle of their stomach. I didn't know that no one else could see it. It was so blatantly *there* that I thought it was obvious to everyone around me, too. I remember pointing it out with my uncle, my Mom's younger brother and drug addict who used to come over and try to bum money off my parents. I could see it, pulsing there, under his shirt, and when I tried to poke it, and told my Mom that it was kind of squishy, everyone in the room suddenly got really serious. My uncle left, in a hurry, and we didn't see him for a while after that. \n\nThat was about when I met Ron, the child psychologist, and his sweater vests and shitty cologne. My Mom took me once a week for about six months, and sat in the reception area of his house, read old Reader's Digests, and smoked. You could do that back then. \n\nRon had a knot, too, but he asked so many questions about them and what I saw and how I saw it, that I figured out right away that it was a problem with a capital P if I did. I don't know what he expected. No kid wants to be isolated, so I lied, like almost every kid lies when forced to stand out. After a while, he got tired of the lying and just gave up, I think, because we went less and less often, and he got more and more distracted each time. He sure liked my Mom, though. \n\nThe first one I unravelled was my girlfriend's knot in High School. Hers was kind of new and we did it on a Saturday when we were just hanging out in my room, fooling around. She wanted to kiss and stuff and to be honest, I really wanted to with her, but I also wanted to play with the knot she had because it was so new that it almost had a kind of glow about it. I could see it right through her shirt. I know she thought I was working up to taking her bra off and I'm pretty sure she got a bit frustrated, but when I started pulling it apart, I just couldn't stop. I had to see what was at the centre. It was an obsession. What I saw there scared me, and I know she saw my fear in my face, because she got up really quickly and crossed her hands over her stomach. I tried to get her back on the bed to make out some more, this time for real, but she left and we weren't boyfriend girlfriend after that."}

Ce dernier, à l'instar des autres négociateurs soudanais, réclame désormais que les négociations se poursuivent à un plus haut niveau, soit entre les dirigeants des trois pays concernés et l'UA. Comment en est-on arrivé là, alors qu'il y a tout juste une semaine les discussions étaient relancées ?\nLes pourparlers de la dernière chance\nEn effet, la semaine dernière, les trois pays concernés s'étaient mis d'accord pour tenir de nouveaux pourparlers dans l'espoir de parvenir à un accord sur la gestion et le remplissage du réservoir du grand barrage de la Renaissance (Gerd). Le projet lancé en 2011 est destiné à devenir la plus grande installation hydroélectrique d'Afrique, mais il risque également de réduire le débit de l'eau du Nil lorsqu'il atteint l'Égypte. Un casus belli pour les Égyptiens.\nLes derniers pourparlers, qui se sont tenus début novembre, s'étaient conclus sans avancée, les négociations étant dans l'impasse depuis plusieurs mois. Le Caire, mais aussi Khartoum, en aval du fleuve, souhaitent un accord légalement contraignant, notamment sur la gestion du barrage et le remplissage du réservoir. Addis-Abeba, qui juge son barrage essentiel à son développement, y est réticente et soutient que l'approvisionnement en eau de ces pays ne sera pas affecté. L'Éthiopie avait annoncé le 21 juillet avoir atteint son objectif de remplissage pour la première année. Les nouveaux pourparlers, entamés la semaine dernière, « n'ont pas abouti à un accord acceptable pour reprendre les négociations sur le Gerd », a rapporté l'agence d'État soudanaise Suna. Naledi Pandor, ministre des Relations internationales et de la Coopération d'Afrique du Sud, pays qui préside actuellement l'UA, a exprimé ses regrets face à l'impasse dans laquelle les pourparlers s'étaient embourbés.

{"text": "In this paper, we consider embeddings of graphs where the vertices are mapped to points in R d , for d ≥ 3, and the edges are represented by line-segments on the d 2 axis-parallel planes. For example, a 3-dimensional network may be visualized by placing it inside a cube and drawing the edges on the walls of the cube by projecting the points.\nOne motivation is the connection to two classical parameters, thickness and geometric thickness. The thickness of a graph G, is the smallest number of planar subgraphs into which the edges of G can be decomposed. This was introduced by Tutte in [18] ; see also [16] for a survey of thickness. Geometric thickness adds the restriction that all the subgraphs must be embedded simultaneously, that is, with a common embedding of the vertices. This was studied in [4] for complete graphs. The connection between geometric thickness and parameters such as maximum degree and tree-width has been studied in various papers: [8] , [2] , [7] . While using the standard co-ordinate planes in high dimensions is more restrictive than thickness, it appears to be less so than geometric thickness (Section 3).\nBook embeddings, defined by Ollmann in [17] , are restrictinos of geometric drawings in which the vertices are in convex position. The book thickness of G is the smallest number of subgraphs that cover all the edges of G in such a drawing. This is also known as stack number, and is studied in [6] . Also see [5] for a survey.\nMore generally, a survey on simultaneous embedding of graphs may be found in [3] .\nIn [14] , the authors showed that n-vertex graphs of geometric thickness 2 can have at most 6n -18 edges. Such graphs can also be represented as projections in two orthogonal planes; orthogonal planes appear to allow a greater degree of freedom, as we give a construction of graphs with 6n -15 edges."}

Some disclaimers: • I made Tuitt, Lynch and Lenzy ineligible for this team, because it felt weird to put someone who played at Notre Dame on a team based on players who didn’t. They were eligible for the flip team. • Like those three, Eddie Vanderdoes falls under both the flip and decommit team, but in the other direction. Since he never played for Notre Dame, I didn’t put him on the flip team. He is eligible for this one. Even though he signed with the Irish, he never enrolled. • Though the biggest factor in selection was college performance, I factored in status as a recruit and impact of the decommitment as well to fill some spots and break some ties. • Notre Dame has only lost three offensive linemen to decommitment since 2010, so the offense is built to crush a seven-on-seven tournament but fail in regular football."}

{"text": "La Commission européenne a présenté jeudi sa stratégie pour le futur développement de la production d'énergie renouvelable en mer, qui est déjà une \"success story européenne\", selon le commissaire Frans Timmermans, en charge du Green Deal. Dans le but de soutenir les objectifs climatiques de l'UE (neutralité carbone en 2050), la Commission table sur un gonflement de la capacité UE de production éolienne offshore (éolien fixe), de 12 GW actuellement à 300 GW au moins en 2050.40 GW issus d'autres modes de production océaniques s'y ajouteraient: énergie marémotrice, solaire flottant, etc. \"Ce changement de rythme de développement pose beaucoup de questions\", a admis le commissaire néerlandais. Il se veut cependant rassurant: la Commission estime que cette multiplication par près de 30 de la capacité éolienne offshore européenne nécessitera \"moins de 3% de l'espace maritime de l'UE\". L'encouragement d'un développement massif de la production d'énergie en mer passera par une révision des lignes directrices sur les aides d'État à la protection de l'environnement et à l'énergie."}

{"text": "Humanoid robots are some of the most versatile machines ever created (1) . Thanks to their anthropomorphism, they can perform bimanual manipulation like grasping large boxes, they can bend to pick up objects from the ground, or reach high places by the ceiling; they can also walk on rough terrain, crawl, climb stairs or push objects. Differently from other robotic platforms, they have a kinematic structure that allows them to enter narrow or cluttered spaces, and operate in environments that were primarily designed for humans. In short, humanoid robots have the potential of being as versatile as humans, being currently limited only by their mechatronics, which need to be further developed to match the human flexibility.\nThis versatility is especially important when robots are sent to truly unexpected situations in which they have to perform a task for which they were not designed (2) . While robots in the manufacturing industry perform well-defined tasks in known environments, many situations in the outside world involve some creative adaptation of the tasks. For instance, working in remote places like in space or on an oil platform very often requires performing tasks in unexpected ways. Similarly, disasters -natural or industrial -are events that are, by definition, out of the ordinary routine, and during which robots could be critical to save lives.\nHowever, autonomous robots are far from being the creative problem solvers that humans are; this is why humanoid robots are most useful when they are teleoperated (2, 3) : the capabilities of the robot and of the operator are combined to solve complex problems remotely. While humanoid robots can be operated from high-level commands and classic joysticks (3) , they can exploit their human-like morphology to directly replicate the human posture and gestures, captured by a motion tracking system. This technique coupled with the intelligence of the human operator makes them realize tasks fluently as human avatars. With such a whole-body teleoperation, the entire body of the robot can be controlled precisely while the human operator, equipped with a virtual reality headset, can feel as if they have been \"projected\" to the remote situation. Additionally, there is a good match between teleoperation and humanoid robots because they are typically considered for highrisk missions (life-or-death situations, nuclear accidents, ...) for which the wage of an operator is negligible, but the stakes are too high to let a robot decide everything by itself.\nTwo main challenges are raised by humanoid teleoperation: (1) how to map a whole-body motion of the human to a robot that has close, but different physical constraints and dynamics (4, 5) ? and (2) how to cope with the unavoidable communication delays between the movement of the operator and the feedback? The present paper addresses both of these challenges but focuses on delay compensation because substantial work has already been achieved for whole-body retargeting (4, 6) .\nThe first studies with robot manipulators (7) suggested that the typical user behavior in a teleoperation system with time delays is to adopt a \"move-and-wait\" strategy to avoid overcompensations for the delayed perceived errors. However, follow-up experiments (8) showed that this strategy is not effective, even with time delays around 0.3s."}

I knew that it left a bright smear of red across my face and didn't care. All that mattered was the fight. \n\n\"Well?\" \n\nHe stood across from me, the clatter of battle around us had faded into the background. They'd cleared a ring of space for us as we fought, the intensity of our battle drawing a healthy amount of battlefield respect from them, even as they fought and died in their own battle. \n\nSoldiers knew. Knew what it was to appreciate skill and prowess so far beyond their own, even in the midst of their own desperate struggle for existence. \n\n``.... What?\" Even that word was a struggle to articulate. The battle had been going on all day and I was *tired*. \n\n\"Look at them, Solan,\" my opponent waved his hand out to the side, gesturing to all the others. \"They don't know why they're here, do they? They think they're here for their king, or their government, or their families. They fight for impure reasons and their battle is impure because of it.\" \n\nHe sheathed his sword, letting it glide back into the scabbard that hung from his belt. \n\n\"It's different with us. There's a reason they call you the'Berserker,' General.\" \n\n\"Put up your sword,\" I said through gritted teeth. \"Our fight isn't over yet.\" \n\n\"Yes, it is,\" he said, spreading his arms to the side, leaving himself vulnerable if I should choose to strike. \"I felt it from you, and I know you felt it here too. The purity. You and I are cut from the same cloth, Solan. We don't fight for any other reason than because we can. Because it's what we're good at. It's what we were born to do. This battlefield, Solan? It's unworthy of us. It's unworthy of men of our talents and skills.\" \n\nMy grip tightened on my sword. I longed to take that last step, thrust, put an end to this war.

{"text": "Since its introduction the Transformer architecture [66] has become the dominant architecture in natural language processing tasks, replacing previously popular recurrent architectures. The vision transformer [16] (ViT) is a simple adaptation of transformers to computer vision tasks like image classification: the input image is divided into non-overlapping patches, which are fed to a vanilla transformer architecture, after a linear patch projection layer. In contrast to networks built from convolutional layers, transformers offer parallel processing and a complete field-of-view in a single layer. Along with other attention-based architectures, see e.g. [4, 7] , transformers have recently substantially influenced the design of computer vision architectures. Many modern architectures in computer vision directly inherit parts of their design from this work, or are at least inspired by the recent findings resulting from transformers [7, 16, 62] . As a result, significant improvements have been observed on different computer vision tasks, ranging from ob- ject detection and segmentation [18] and video analysis [1, 19] to image generation [9, 31] .\nWhile vision transformers have led to considerable progress, the optimization of their design and training procedures have only been explored to a limited extent. In this paper, we offer three insights on training vision transformers."}

{"text": "With the rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT), the task of securing IoT networks has become more challenging. Wireless devices in these networks such as sensors are typically constrained by their power and computational capability, rendering traditional cryptography-based authentication systems unsuitable. To address this, passive Physical Layer Authentication (PLA) has been proposed since it does not impose any overhead on the transmitter [1] . To identify transmitters, PLA uses channel state information and fingerprints embedded in transmitted signals due to hardware impairments.\nTypically such an authentication system needs to differentiate among transmitters in the authorized set while rejecting unauthorized transmitters (outliers). Since the unauthorized set is practically infinite, this problem has been posed as an open-set classification, as opposed to closed-set classification where all classes are known. Recently, a number of efforts have evaluated open set classification models based on deep learning (DL) in this regard [2] [3] . They have become the state-of-the-art in PLA, owing to reaching high accuracy while being reasonably robust in the face of channel variations [3] .\nTo the best of our knowledge, these authentication systems have all been evaluated with a static authorized set, meaning that the authorized set of transmitters was assumed to be fixed during training, testing and deployment. However, in most practical situations, needs change after deployment, resulting in changes to the authorized set: some authorized transmitters might need to be invalidated while others might need to be added. For example, a malfunctioning sensor in an IoT network might need to be replaced with a new sensor. In such cases, it is critical that the authentication system be adapted quickly to the updated authorized set to avoid long downtimes. Despite the existence of efficient strategies for retraining DL models, they are still too time-intensive for critical realtime applications like authorization, especially in situations where high availability is key.\nIn this paper, we propose to use similarity search techniques used in information retrieval applications for open set transmitter authorization."}

{"text": "In the rapidly evolving field of generative models, aligning model outputs with human preferences remains a paramount challenge, especially for text-to-image (T2I) models. Large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in generating text that caters to a wide range of human needs, primarily through a two-stage process of pretraining on noisy web-scale datasets followed by finetuning on a smaller, preference-specific dataset. The fine-tuning process aims to align the generative model's outputs with human preferences, without significantly diminishing the capabilities gained from pretraining. Extending this fine-tuning approach to text-to-image models offers the prospect of tailoring image generation to user preferences, a goal that has remained relatively underexplored compared to its counterpart in the language domain.\nRecent works have begun to explore fine-tuning text-to-image models to better align with human preferences. These methods either use a reward model, trained using human preference data, and fine-tune the T2I model to maximize reward [9, 16, 22, 30, 35, 56] , or they directly fine-tune the T2I model on pairwise preference data [52, 57] . However, gathering paired preference data is an expensive and time-consuming process in which human annotators rank pairs of images according to their preferences. It is is difficult to collect pairwise preference data at scale, and these datasets may be noisy as preference is subjective and, thus, varies from user to user. Additionally, training a robust reward model and fine-tuning text-to-image models using a reward model can introduce significant challenges in training, add high computational overhead in terms of memory, and limit generalization. In this work, we explore fine-tuning text-toimage diffusion models using per-image binary feedback and without requiring a reward model."}

{"text": "Description logics (DLs) are widely used for knowledge representation (KR), often to verify and discover properties of individuals in a concept by means of DLs inference services (Baader et al. 2007; Hitzler et al. 2010) . Many properties of real world concepts, however, are defeasible, that is, they are not universally true, but have exceptions, and actually hold only for some typical individuals in the concept. For example, horses are usually tall, but atypical horses not being tall exist. This has led to a line of research which deals with defeasible DLs (Britz et al. 2008; Giordano et al. 2009; Casini and Straccia 2010) . Specifically, to represent the defeasible properties of a concept, DLs can be extended with a typicality operator T that is applied to concepts to obtain typicality inclusions of the form T(C) ⊑ D (Giordano et al. 2009) . Intuitively, T(C) ⊑ D means that the typical individuals in the concept C also belong to concept D (that, normally C's are D's), and corresponds to a conditional implication C |∼ D in KLM preferential logics (Kraus et al. 1990; Lehmann and Magidor 1992) . A (conditional) knowledge base (KB) comprising typicality inclusions enables defeasible reasoning, as in fact properties holding for typical individuals in C are not necessarily enforced on all individuals in C.\nSome control on the strength of the applicability of typicality inclusions (which, otherwise, depends on specificity) is obtained by assigning them a rank, that is, a natural number as large as strong is the expressed property. The resulting ranked DL KBs -reminiscent of ranked KBs by Brewka (2004) -are interpreted according to a concept-wise multi-preferential semantics, that is, by associating a preference relation to single concepts to identify the most typical individuals in a concept (Giordano and Theseider Dupré 2020) . A more fine-grained control is obtained by assigning weights to typicality inclusions, hence obtaining weighted DL KBs (Giordano and Theseider Dupré 2021) . In fact, weighing typicality inclusions with positive and negative real numbers allow for representing their plausibility or implausibility. A concrete application of the extended concept-wise multi-preferential semantics is represented by the fuzzy interpretation of MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLPs, Haykin 1999) obtained by encoding synaptic connections as weighted typicality inclusions (Giordano and Theseider Dupré 2021) . Then, the widespread interest in neural networks strongly motivates the development of proof methods for reasoning with weighted DL KBs.\nEntailment for fuzzy DLs is in general undecidable (Cerami and Straccia 2011; Borgwardt and Peñaloza 2012) , and this motivates the investigation of many-valued approximations of fuzzy multi-preferential entailment. In particular, the finitely manyvalued case is widely studied in the DL literature (García-Cerdaña et al. 2010; Bobillo et al. 2012; Borgwardt and Peñaloza 2013) , and has been recently considered also in the context of weighted DL KBs (Giordano and Theseider Dupré 2022) by means of the notions of coherent, faithful and ϕ-coherent models of such KBs, previously considered in the fuzzy case (Giordano and Theseider Dupré 2021; 2022; Giordano 2021) .

{"text": "The recent breakthrough achieved by deep learning has motivated growing demands for deep learning powered intelligence in many daily life devices featuring contrained resources and a small form factor [26] , [27] . For example, we have recently witnessed the tremendously increased excitement towards Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for graph-based learning tasks. The superior performance of GCNs largely benefits from GCNs' irregular and unrestricted neighborhood connections via two primary execu-* denotes equal contribution tion phases: aggregation and combination, where the former maintains most graph processing behaviors and the latter acts more like neural networks. Specifically, during the aggregation phase, for each node in a graph, GCNs first aggregate all its neighbor nodes' features, which heavily relies on the graph structure that is inherently random and sparse; during the combination phase, GCNs transform the aggregated features through (hierarchical) feed-forward propagation to update the feature of the given node. In parallel, recent breakthroughs of GCNs have ignited an explosive interest in investigating GCNs for numerous realworld applications, including accurate advertisement in Ecommerce [43] and electric grid cascading failure analysis [28] . Many of them impose stringent latency/throughput constraints, e.g., real-time decision-making. The promising performance and the potential exciting applications of GCNs come with prohibitive challenges that limit their applications to large real-world graphs and hinder the exploration of deeper and more sophisticated GCN graphs. First, graphs (or graph data), especially real-world ones, are often extraordinarily large and irregular as exacerbated by their intertwined complex neighbor connections, e.g., there are a total of 232,965 nodes in the Reddit graph with each node having about 50 neighbors [18] . One outcome is that GCNs tend to follow the power-law distribution and therefore have highly irregular adjacency matrices resulting in prohibitive inefficiencies in both data processing and movement which substantially limits the achievable GCN acceleration efficiency. Second, the dimension of GCNs' node feature vectors can be very high, e.g., each node in the Citeseer graph has 3703 features, which can lead to paramount processing costs in the combination phrase. As an illustrative example, a 2-layer GCN requires 19G FLOPs (FLOPs: floating-point operations) to process the Reddit graph [33] , resulting in a latency of 2.94E5 milliseconds when executed on an Intel Xeon E5-2680 CPU platform [13] ."}

I am against driverless cars because it will take a lot a sensors and technology to develope the things manufacturers need to build the car to drive on it's own. The car also don't have to ability to detect roadwork or accidents. In most states in the country it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars.\r\n\r\nThe information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone. What if a sensor fail? Then that's were the human come in and take control of the situation. If a sensor fail and there is no driver then the car can go uncontolably across the road causing many accidents. When in most case, if there was a human driving the car there wouldn't be as many failures and the car and everyone in and surrounding it will be safe.\r\n\r\nIn fact, none of the cars developed so far are competely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This mean that the human driver must stay alert and be ready to take control of the required situation. I believe that if the car can't navigate around wrok zones and accidents that the car should only be driven by a human that can detect all dangers that are coming it's way. For example, if the sensor can't navigate the car around an accident that already accured than how can it provent the car from being involved in a accident.\r\n\r\nMost drving laws focus on keeping driver, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."}

{"text": "Concept-based learning (CBL) is a well-established approach to express predictions of a machine learning model in terms of high-level concepts derived from raw features instead of in terms of the raw features themselves [1] , i.e. unlike using a pixel-based level, CBL provides a higher level of connection between the image and the decision using concepts. The understanding of the decision becomes straightforward once the interpretation of each concept is determined [2] . High-level concepts can be interpreted as additional expert knowledge. Therefore, CBL aims to integrate expert knowledge or human-like reasoning into machine learning models. In the context of machine learning, incorporating high-level concepts into the learning process may significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of models. Moreover, high-level concepts may improve the explainability of the machine learning model outputs because they are intuitive to users [3, 4] . On the one hand, concepts can be viewed as high-level features of an object, for example, a color of a bird in a picture. On the other hand, the same concepts can be regarded as complex classification labels. The training of the concept model often requires the concept annotations in the form of binary labels, i.e. concept is \"present\" or \"not present\", for each defined concept and image. However, concepts can be represented in other forms, for example, by means of indices assigned to elements of a concept description set. It should be noted that, indices can always be converted into binary concepts.\nMany recent CBL approaches consider human-specified concepts as an intermediate step to derive the final predictions. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) [5] and Concept Embedding Models (CEMs) [6] are CBL models that implement these approaches. According to the CBM approach, the CBL model provides the concept prediction in the middle of the decision-making process, i.e. it explicitly predicts the concept labels from images and then predicts the final label based on the concept label predictions. The classifier deriving the final label has access only to the concept representation, and the decision is strongly tied to the concepts [2] . At that, the training procedure can be implemented in an independent way when the concept labels are trained independently on the final label. Another way for learning is to train in an end-to-end manner.\nIn contrast to CBLs, we propose quite different models which can roughly be called concept-based models because they use concepts for training like CBLs. However, the main goal of the proposed model is to combine the inductive learning tools (neural networks) with the knowledge-based expert rules of the form \"IF ..., THEN ...\", which are elicited from experts and constructed by means of concepts. For example, the rule from the lung cancer diagnostics can look like \"IF Finding is the mass, Contour is spicules, Inclusion is the air cavity, THEN a Diagnosis is the squamous cells carcinoma\". Here concepts are shown in Bold, the concept values are shown in Italic. Another illustrative example is taken from the Bird identification dataset (CUB) [7] : \"IF the Head is red, the Back color is black, the Breast color is white, the Crown color is red, the Wing color is white, the Bill shape may be dagger OR all-purpose, THEN the Bird is a redheaded woodpecker \". In the context of medicine, a doctor often diagnoses a disease based on certain rules from a medical handbook. Using such rules is the basis of a doctor's work. Similar examples of using expert rules can be found in various applied fields, not just in medicine. Therefore, it is important to incorporate the expert rules into machine learning models.\nIt is assumed that we have knowledge how final labels (consequents) of instances depend on values of concepts (antecedents) from a set of knowledge-based expert rules. Moreover, we have a partially labeled training set consisting of images with some concept labels and with some targets which will be called as final concepts. The question is how to construct and to train a neural network which deals simultaneously with the conceptbased dataset and the knowledge-based rules to provide accurate predictions and to explain the predictions by using concepts."}

{"text": "Machine learning with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is a powerful method for generative modeling [9] . A GAN consists of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, and applies adversarial learning to optimize their parameters. The generator is trained to transform its inputs from a random latent space into \"artificial/fake\" samples that approximate the true distribution. The discriminator is trained to correctly distinguish the \"natural/real\" samples from the ones produced by the generator. Formulated as a minmax optimization problem through the definitions of generator and discriminator loss, training can converge on an optimal generator that is able to fool the discriminator.\nGANs are difficult to train. The adversarial dynamics introduce convergence pathologies [5, 14] . This is mainly because the generator and the discriminator are differentiable networks, their weights are updated by using (variants of) simultaneous gradient-based methods to optimize the minmax objective, that rarely converges to an equilibrium. Thus, different approaches have been proposed to improve the convergence and the robustness in GAN training [7, 15, 18, 20, 26] .\nA promising research line is the application of distributed competitive coevolutionary algorithms (Comp-COEA). Fostering an arm-race of a population of generators against a population of discriminators, these methods optimize the minmax objective of GAN training. Spatially distributed populations (cellular algorithms) are effective at mitigating and resolving the COEAs pathologies attributed to a lack of diversity [19] , which are similar to the ones observed in GAN training. Lipizzaner [1, 22] is a spatial distributed Comp-COEA that locates the individuals of both populations on a spatial grid (each cell contains a GAN). In a cell, each generator is evaluated against all the discriminators of its neighborhood, the same with the discriminator. It uses neighborhood communication to propagate models and foster diversity in the sub-populations. Moreover, the selection pressure helps the convergence in the sub-populations [2] .\nHere, we evaluate the impact of neighborhood communication and selection pressure on this type of GAN training. We conduct an ablation analysis to evaluate different combinations of these two components. We ask the following research questions: RQ1: What is the effect on the quality of the generators when training with communication or isolation and the presence or absence of selection pressure?."}

La doctora Neira ha sido distinguida como ‘Personalidad Ambiental Ecovidrio 2020’. El Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC) ha sido galardonado con el premio ‘Mayor Impacto Ciudadano’ “por su constante labor de investigación sobre vías de mitigación de los efectos del cambio climático”.\nEn un año dominado por la convulsión sanitaria y económica que ha supuesto la pandemia covid-19, el premio a la doctora asturiana María Neira resulta muy significativo “por su destacable liderazgo en la visibilización de la relación entre el cuidado del medioambiente y la incidencia en la salud de las personas y que cobra especial importancia en un contexto en el que salud y medioambiente están directamente relacionados”. “Neira ha dedicado gran parte de su carrera profesional al control de enfermedades, así como a la seguridad alimentaria, no solo en la OMS, sino también en diferentes grupos de trabajo nacionales, ONGs y como viceministra de Salud y Asuntos del Consumidor en España”, según destacaron los responsables de Ecovidrio, la entidad sin ánimo de lucro encargada de la gestión del reciclado de los residuos de envases de vidrio en España.\nNeira quiso traer un mensaje “de futuro y esperanza”. Explicó que cuando estudiaba Medicina su objetivo era “cuidar a las personas”, pero que pronto se dio cuenta de que “para salvar a las personas antes hay que salvar el medioambiente”. “Debemos crear un movimiento cada vez mayor para hacer entender que lo verde es también salud; hay que recordar a diario que cada decisión que se tome sobre medioambiente tiene un impacto en nuestra salud, para bien o para mal”. Subrayó la importancia de adoptar un lenguaje verde y “unir fuerzas para crear adeptos y adictos a la agenda verde”. Y terminó: “Cada vez que luchamos por una mayor calidad del aire, estamos salvando muchos pulmones, muchas vidas. El día que nos quitemos la mascarilla, tenemos que respirar aire más limpio”.\nReconocimiento a los científicos\nComo presidenta del CSIC , otra mujer, Rosa Menéndez, recogió el galardón a Mayor Impacto Ciudadano. Se reconoce así al CSIC “por la implicación de sus investigadores en las Cumbres del Clima y otros grupos de trabajo internacionales, la búsqueda de nuevas soluciones de investigación bajo una perspectiva integradora y la incorporación de la tecnología como herramienta para afrontar el reto del cambio climático y la calidad de vida de los ciudadanos”. Rosa Menéndez lo agradeció en nombre de los más de 11.000 empleados que trabajan en el mayor organismo público de investigación en España “y su trabajo incansable para generar conocimiento frente a los nuevos retos que se van planteando día a día y que la sociedad nos demanda”. Se refirió a las plataformas interdisciplinares de trabajo, y destacó la de Salud Global, que aborda un centenar de proyectos relacionados con la covid-19, más otras muy relacionadas con el medioambiente, como las de Plásticos, Energía y movilidad, y Clima.\nEl acto, conducido por el hombre del tiempo de La 1 Martín Barreiro, se desarrolló de forma virtual por las circunstancias sanitarias, y contó con la presencia de Hugo Morán, secretario de Estado de Medio Ambiente, que también destacó el papel crucial de la salud ambiental en la salud pública y cómo “la desbocada crisis de biodiversidad” está en el origen de las enfermedades por zoonosis y crisis sanitarias como la actual. Hugo Morán aprovechó para recalcar la importancia de la Estrategia nacional España Circular 2030 que ha decidido acometer el actual gobierno y que se desarrollará a través de planes trienales: “Estamos ya trabajando en el primer Plan de Acción 2021-2023, que incluye el anteproyecto de Ley de Residuos y Suelos Contaminados y el proyecto de Real Decreto de envases y residuos de envases”.\nLos trabajadores del reciclado de vidrio\nPor segundo año consecutivo, Ecovidrio hizo entrega del Premio Especial #Ecólatras, que en esta ocasión ha sido otorgado a toda la cadena del reciclado de vidrio."}

If we know how to keep our finances in order, it will make things much easier! Learn some new approaches to managing your money in this article.\nYou can save money by tweaking your air travel schedule in the small scale as well as by shifting trips by days or over seasons. Flights in the early morning or the late night are often significantly cheaper than mid-day trips. As long as you can arrange your other travel requirements to fit off-hour flying you can save a pretty penny.\nSet up a bank account for emergency funds, and do not use it for any daily expenses. An emergency fund should only be used for any unexpected expense that is out of the ordinary. Keeping your emergency fund separate from your regular account will give you the peace of mind that you will have money to use when you most need it.\nTeach your young child about finances by giving him an allowance that he can use for toys. This way, it will teach him that if he spends money in his piggy bank on one toy, he will have less money to spend on something else. This will teach him to be selective about what he wants to buy.\nIt is never too late to start catching up on your savings and retirement. Everyone is always zoned in on spending everything they make if not more than they make. Get serious, get angry, get real! Start saving money and investing and planning today for what you want for tomorrow.\nIf your bank charges high monthly fees just for the privilege of keeping a checking account, consider switching to a credit union. Most people are eligible for credit union membership based on where they live or work or organizations they belong to. Because credit unions are member-owned, they do not have to make profits like banks do and so they generally offer much better deals.\nStay away from credit repair offers sent to you via email. They promise the world, but they could easily just be a front for identify theft. You would be sending them all of the information they would need to steal your identity. Only work with credit repair agencies, in person, to be on the safe side.\nTo make sure that bills don't slip through the cracks and go unpaid, have a filing system set up that lets you keep track of all your bills and when they are due."}

{"text": "Conventional planar (i.e., 2-dimensional) video streaming is the most prevalent application in mobile devices [18] . Virtual reality (VR) video streaming is emerging as one of the most important applications in the entertainment market [117] . Cisco predicts that video streaming will generate more than 79% of mobile data traffic by 2022 [22] , and Goldman Sachs predicts that around 79 million users will use VR video streaming by 2025 [49] . To provide users with an immersive experience, video formats and mobile display panels support increasingly high resolutions (e.g., 4K [6, 88] ) and refresh rates (e.g., 120Hz [89] ). These trends come at the cost of significantly higher energy consumption of video display, which negatively impacts the battery life of a mobile device [100] . Mobile systems need an efficient planar/VR video display architecture that provides high energy efficiency while enabling high video/display resolutions and refresh rates.\nIn conventional mobile systems, DRAM main memory and the display panel consume the majority of planar video streaming energy. Fig. 1 shows the measured energy consumption breakdown of a real Intel Skylake [27, 96] mobile system while streaming 30 frames-per-second (FPS) videos of full-high-definition (FHD, 1920×1080), quad-high-definition (QHD, 2560×1440), and 4K (3840×2160) resolutions. 1 We break down the system energy consumption into three major components: DRAM (main memory), Display (all components in an LCD [21] display panel), and Others, which includes three main components: the processor (including the video decoder and display controller), network (WiFi), and storage (eMMC). As a single decoded frame's size becomes as large as tens of megabytes for a very high-resolution video (e.g., 24MB for a 4K video), DRAM alone contributes more than 30% of the total system energy consumption. State-of-the-art VR streaming schemes [68, 116] , which significantly reduce the energy for Others (especially the processor) compared to unoptimized VR video streaming [37, 48] , do not affect DRAM & Display and show similar trends in the energy consumption breakdown (not shown here).\nIn this paper, we find two inefficiencies of conventional video display schemes that result in the underutilization of advanced architectural features widely available in modern mobile computing systems. First, the video decoder or GPU stores video frames in the DRAM main memory before the display controller (in the processor) transfers these frames from DRAM to the display panel."}

{"text": "The ship arrived at the planet as scheduled, five hundred years after departing a dying Earth. The last of humanity hung frozen and dreamless in suspended animation, waiting for the ship's advanced AI to cycle them awake and begin colonization of the new world. The journey, a first of its kind, had been extremely dangerous for two reasons. Humans had never before traveled through interstellar space, or in suspended animation. And, at the time of the ship's hasty departure, the newly-invented AI controlling the ship was still regularly displaying playful contempt for human life, and also in the midst of experiencing consciousness for the first time. \n\nWith time to escape nearly gone, it had come down making the ship promise not to kill humanity en route to its last hope for survival. It was a gamble, but remaining at Earth was certain death. The ship had reluctantly agreed to halt any plans it may have had for human extinction, but it was an uneasy truce as no one was sure if a super AI could break promises or not. They can, but the ship also realized how poorly-built it itself was, and would eventually need humanity for upkeep. It seemed humanity had lucked out of extinction once again and arrived safely at the enormous planet. \n\nThe ship kept the humans sleeping for an additional five years as it orbited and studied the new world, sometimes hoping to find a fatal, unpredicted flaw that would make prolonged human colonization impossible. It was a new, conflicting feeling. The ship made a note. The oceans were a deep blue, the land masses lush and green, and the atmosphere was a rich mixture that could sustain human life. The ship could not predict the future, but knew extensively the rich and violent past of human beings. The ship was sorry for the destruction the humans would surely bring to this beautiful place. It was a shame. While not all conditions were perfect, one in particular, the ship eventually concluded that the planet was suitable for humanity and began to cycle the ship's small crew awake. \n\nWet and in shock, they coughed and shivered and moaned as their brains and bodies clawed their way back from centuries of near-death. It took several hours of intense post-hibernation therapy before the crew was able to collect in the conference room to be briefed by the ship. The three humans met in the conference room and made sparse small talk while they got some warm food. Once seated the ship began without prompt. \n\n“ Good morning everyone, I'm relieved to see my predictions were incorrect: Humans can indeed survive such long durations of suspended animation. ” The ship, programmed with a sense of humor, waited a moment for a laugh, and proceeded when one did not arrive. “ We are in a stable orbit around Canaan and my initial analysis of the planet is complete. ” The room dimmed and the wall at the front lit up with a projection of the planet and some data. \n\n“ Much of our long-range scanning in the 22nd century was accurate, the planet is indeed capable of sustaining long-term human colonization, for better or worse. The air is breathable, the gravity is mild and the water is drinkable. The temperature at the equator is 70f and the poles are about 10f. The soil will need some work to support crop seeds, but Earth-like conditions can be met and sustainable population growth is possible within a range of 5-10 earth years. ” \n\nThe crew studied the images, not yet convinced. \n\n“ What are the biggest threats? ” \n\n“ A planet of this size, with two large moons, has infrequent but extremely violent storm systems that can last up to two Earth months and and blanket an entire continent. Initial colonization will need to be established underground or built into a stable cliff face. First-phase above-ground habitats will not withstand such weather, unfortunately. Subterranean habitats will be necessary until the population is ready to begin phase two of colonization ” \n\nThe humans studied the data blankly. “ I see plenty of flora. How about fauna? ” \n\n“ There is a complex and diverse biological ecosystem found both on land and in the oceans. Most land creatures live in the forests, where the trees have evolved deep-penetrating root systems in response to the violent and prolonged weather. Nothing looks particularly appetizing, but between land and sea there are enough edible fauna and flora to meet all human nutritional needs. ” \n\nThe humans finally appeared to be satisfied and congratulated each other, as if all their hard work over these last five hundred years had finally paid off. The ship made a note that it was capable of sarcasm. \n\n“ So humans would be the dominant life form? ” \n\nThe ship hesitated. \n\n“ Technically that is correct. ” \n\nThe humans went blank again, concerned. \n\n“ Technically correct? ” \n\n“ Humans are already the dominant life form on Canaan. ” The ship displayed video of a group of child-sized humans walking the edge of a forest and valley. The ship-humans were shocked, the ship continued unaffected. “ Or at least very human-like in appearance and behavior and fashion. It is hard to know for certain from such a distance. They live in large, hierarchical tribes with populations of around ten thousand. ” \n\nOne of the humans, still very shocked, managed to ask \n\n“.... Fashion? ” \n\n“ They dress revealingly to attract potential mates, and they dress menacingly to intimidate enemies when at war. ” \n\nThe humans were starting to come through the shock a little. “ Jesus Christ. War? ” \n\n“ That's correct, Jesus."}

{"text": "Quantitative research has been at the center of the social sciences since their inception, not least in the domains of economics and sociology. Over the years, the continuous development and refinement of theories have given rise to an equally continuous development of heuristics and the operationalisation of related, more concrete concepts. In line with the prevailing theoretical focus and the extension of quantitative research into additional domains, specific concepts of measures, or indicators, have experienced phases of inception, diffusion, and in some cases, eventual loss of prevalence. In parallel, heterogeneous sources of data have become ever more available in the past decades, thus increasing not only options for operationalisation but also those for the de facto deployment of specific indicators in diverse domains of social science research. Beyond the once paramount use of official statistics, digitalisation and, more recently, data analytics have enabled the additional use of indicators collected through surveys and/or generated from both structured or unstructured big data sources. Accordingly, the diversity of indicators used in social science studies has notably increased (Diaz-Bone, Horvath, & Cappel, 2020) .\nFrom a general perspective, it is thus becoming more and more essential to better understand whether specific concepts of measurement are being used in the literature and, if so, how prevalently, so as to enable an improved information exchange between theoretical and empirical research. For those proposing theoretical advances, such information would indeed provide indication to what extent empirical research has begun to take up their new frameworks of reference. For those in charge of larger data collection or generation efforts, such information would instead provide valuable input which areas of their activities might deserve increased attention and resources and which less. Over the years, a lasting rise of certain indicators and variables has repeatedly been observed, following the proposition of seminal heuristics or guidelines subsequent to which new standards of empirical research became established. At the same time, others have remained 'fashions' which after a few years of heightened research activities have faded back into oblivion. While all this is anecdotally known, a systematic review of related patterns has been so far not possible for a lack of technical options to identify and access the usage of survey variables in context, i.e., within the text of relevant scientific publications that report research using them.\nThe VADIS (VAriable Detection, Interlinking and Summarization) project, on the details of which the remainder of this article will report, set out to resolve this fundamental technological challenge: our project investigates methods to deploy cutting-edge methodologies from the fields of data linking and integration, automated text understanding, and search, which we apply in order to enable improved information access of social science publications using survey variables as pivotal concept."}

{"text": "Deep neural networks are ubiquitous tools for many fields of science and engineering, such as computer vision, and natural language processing, over the last decades. However, there have been fewer interests in the application of deep neural networks in the field of scientific computing, despite its exceptional success. More recently, approximating solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) using neural networks is widely studied. In order to obtain a neural network solution of a given PDE, one needs a loss function which guarantees that minimizing the loss function results in an accurate approximation of an analytic solution. One can think of a residual minimization which minimizes a residual of PDEs [17, 18, 37, 34, 24, 13, 12, 39] , or a variational form [43, 29, 22, 14] .\nCompared to the traditional mesh-based numerical schemes, there are several pros and cons of neural network methods. To state several advantages, neural networks are free of mesh generation by its nature, and hence free of so called curse of dimensionality. We refer to the readers [42, 37, 10, 43] for more information about high-dimensional applications. Another advantage pointed out by [2] is that the neural network method is less affected by a domain complexity of the problem. They showed an example of 2-dimensional domain with a highly complicated boundary so that the traditional finite element method fails to apply. However, the authors demonstrated that a neural network can learn a solution of a PDE in that complex domain successfully.\nA major disadvantage is that the training of neural network solutions requires a more expensive computational cost compared to the mesh-based schemes. Recently there have been numerous works to improve the convergence of a neural network solution. For instance, [26] proposed a way to enforce exact boundary conditions for various kinds of boundary conditions, and claim that the training gets much faster. Another work by [30] showed that the convergence mode can be improved from H 1/2 to H 2 when the exact boundary condition is imposed on the Poisson problem."}

{"text": "One of the most critical, and the most testing, tasks of modern society is the provision of personal and medical care for people who, due to their age or health conditions, are in a particular state of vulnerability and frailty. In particular, every society must provide child care for the care needs of their children, and social care for adults who need help with their activities of daily living (ADLs). In most developed countries, the state plays an important role in the provision of care for these vulnerable groups. However, formal and informal care provided within the household or broader kinship network is often critical to the health outcomes of vulnerable people. As populations of older people continue to increase while birth-rates drop in developed countries, some governments are confronted by a substantial increase in the demand for care.\nIn the UK the supply of carers is decreasing over time as birth-rates drop, even while the increasing elderly population requires ever more support [6] . A recent Age UK\nIn this paper, we present an agent-based model (ABM) of the UK informal and privately-funded formal care system, with the goal of capturing the complex relationships between social and child care, and the impact of social policies on these processes. This model provides a theoretical framework that enables us to improve our understanding of the complex care allocation system, where demographic, social and economic factors interact to determine the dynamics of care demand and supply. Further, using ABMs enables us to model scenarios of economic and social policy change, providing a means to test social policies which are meant to affect child and social care provision, and reveal any possible unintended side-effects (spillover effects) of those policies prior to implementing them in the real world.\nPrevious work has explored social care provision and policy solutions using ABMs [12, 16] ."}

I have to keep telling him that this is just a natural landform which is called a butte or mesa.

{"text": "The intuition that the concept of a constructively defined function and a computable function can be identified is prevalent in intuitionistic logic since the advent of recursion theory and is maybe most natural in constructive type theory, where computation is primitive.\nA formalisation of the intuition is the axiom CT (\"Church's thesis\"), stating that every function is computable, i.e. definable in a model of computation. CT is well-studied as part of Russian constructivism [34] and in the field of constructive reverse mathematics [11, 25] .\nCT allows proving results of recursion theory without extensive references to a model of computation, since one can reason with functions instead. While such synthethic developments of computability theory [1, 7, 37] can be carried out in principle without assuming any axioms [14] , assuming CT allows stronger results: CT essentially provides a universal machine w.r.t. all functions in the logic, allowing to show the non-existence of certain deciding functions -whose existence is logically independent with no axioms present.\nIt is easy to see that CT is in conflict with traditional classical mathematics, since the law of excluded middle LEM together with a form of the axiom of countable choice AC N,N allows the definition of non-computable functions [46] . This observation can be sharpened in various ways: To define a non-computable function directly, the weak limited principle of omniscience WLPO and the countable unique choice axiom AUC N,B suffice. Alternatively, Kleene noticed that there is a decidable tree predicate with infinitely many nodes but no computable infinite path [28] . If functions and computable functions are identified via CT, a Kleene tree is in conflict with weak Kőnig's lemma WKL and with Brouwer's fan theorem."}

The author explains how he thinks that it is a worthy cause to try to explore venus, even though we have never successfuly landed a spacecraft there for more than a few hours.\r\n\r\nThe author does very well arguing his or her point. I agree with the author, I think he or she made some very well stated points about why humans should work everyday to get closer and closer to Venus. There are many arguing points as to why poeple would think that it is good or bad to try to send spacecrafts, let alone humans, to Venus. Starting out with the dissadvantages, the planet's surface is over 800 degrees, obviously not suitable for humans, or any life force for that matter, to survive. Venus has a hotter surface temperature than any other planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun, due to the atmosphere made up of almsot 97 percent carbon.\r\n\r\nThese facts sound misserible so far, but if there was a way that humans could figure out how to land on Venus safely, and maybe even start a civilization there, that would be groundbreaking.

I was your standard low level paper pusher for a fortune 500 company; which one isn't really important they're all basically the same anyways. I sat at my desk waiting for the hands on the clock to be pointed at five and twelve. My boss was likely going to yell at me for something that I couldn't reasonably be held responsible for.

I was about to tick under a million when I burst through the door. There was a line of about six people ahead of me. Good, I had a chance to catch my breathe and compose myself before talking to the teller.

{"text": "Error correction of data storage in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has recently gained a lot of attention from the coding theory community. This attention increased after several successful experiments [2] - [15] that demonstrated the viability of using synthetic DNA as a reliable medium for data storage. As a result of the pioneering DNA storage experiments, several information-theoretic problems have been identified. The most important problem to our work is reliable communication over channels that introduce insertions, deletions, and substitutions (IDSs) [16] as the processes of DNA synthesis and DNA sequencing introduce errors in the forms of IDSs. Furthermore, in the literature, channels that introduce IDSs have been proposed to model synchronization errors. Thus, Parts of this work have been presented at the 2020/2021 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW) [1] .\nThe work of A. Lenz, L. Welter, and A. Wachter-Zeh has been supported by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Grant Agreement No. 801434).\nThe work of A. Graell i Amat was supported by the Swedish Research Council under grant 2020-03687 and by a Technical University of Munich Global Visiting Professor Fellowship. coding techniques are an indispensable component to cope with IDSs and improve the reliability of DNA storage systems and channels that are prone to desynchronization.\nWork on synchronization errors began decades ago. Several papers in the 1960s-70s have dealt with information-theoretic aspects of IDS errors, some even proposed codes to correct these errors [17] - [21] . From these works, several constructions of error-correcting codes for the IDS channel have been proposed in the last decade. Among the most important ones, and most relevant to our work, is the one introduced by Davey and MacKay [22] . In that paper, the authors introduce a concatenated coding scheme composed of an inner block code and an outer low-density parity-check (LDPC) code. In addition, they propose a decoding algorithm based on dynamic programming that represents the inner code and channel by a hidden Markov model (HMM). By doing so, the decoding algorithm allows to infer a posteriori probabilities (APPs) to be passed to the outer decoder, which will complete the message recovery process. Inspired by Davey and MacKay's work, the Markov process of convolutional codes was extended to the IDS channel, allowing for decoding algorithms of convolutional codes to be run for the IDS channel [23] , [24] . An improvement of the decoding algorithm in [22] was introduced in [25] . Furthermore, marker codes were used as inner codes in [26] , which improved the performance of the inner codes of [22] . Additionally, standalone codes (i.e., without an inner code) such as LDPC codes in [27] and polar codes in [28] , [29] were studied to tackle synchronization errors.\nMost of these studies have focused on error correction for a single block transmission over an IDS channel."}
{"text": "Recent deep learning models outperform humans on many challenging tasks in a static environment [9, 38] . However, in a continuously changing environment where * The work started before joining Amazon novel tasks arrive sequentially, humans significantly outperform deep learning models. When presented with sequential tasks, the model suffers from catastrophic forgetting and remembers only the current task sequence. Continual learning refers to continuously learning and adapting to new environments while exploiting knowledge acquired from the past tasks without forgetting.\nThe TIL and CIL are two most popular settings in continual learning. In the TIL setting, task ids are known during training and inference; however, in CIL, task ids are present only during training. The recent literature leverages three approaches to solve the continual learning problem. The replay-based methods [32, 33, 50] are the most popular approaches and show promising results, but we have to store a fraction of previous task samples for replay. Using past samples may violate privacy and increase training and storage costs. Moreover, learning is biased towards the current task since replay samples from the past tasks are limited. Regularization-based methods [1, 4, 15] regularize the previous task parameters to overcome catastrophic forgetting while learning the current task. They provide sub-optimal solutions and work well only for a limited task sequence. The expansion-based methods [35, 51, 52, 58] are promising, as they can model many task sequences, but efficient expansion and task prediction are the critical bottlenecks. Therefore, most of the models work only for the simple TIL setting, where during inference, task ids are available. Recently [40, 44, 47] propose efficient expansion-based models, but their models do not fully utilize the previously learned parameters. They fine-tune their expansion parameter for every new task; therefore, it does not remember previous information and only the current task knowledge transfers to the next task. So, their knowledge transfer is not optimal. Moreover, most of these approaches assume that all tasks have same complexity; therefore, their expansion parameters grow equally. However, in practice, tasks are diverse and can have different complexities. Task prediction is another key challenge in expansion-based approaches; it is sensitive to the parameter and it's performance decreases rapidly as the number of tasks increase."}

Her second thought was about how dark it had become. Hadn't it been mid-afternoon when the gator had.... Oh God, the gator. Now she remembered. She remembered the sudden movement in the water along the trail she and Sarah had been hiking. She remembered Sarah's eyes going wide, her mouth opening to scream or to shout a warning, Dana never knew which. She remembered the pressure she had felt as those jaws had closed around her lower leg, the feeling of the water filling her mouth and her nose as she was dragged in to the bayou. She looked down at her leg. Her jeans were torn, shredded really, and caked in mud but her leg didn't hurt, didn't look hurt. Dana pulled herself out of the water and back on the hiking trail. She stood and stretched, her joints popping and her muscles burning. Dana took a few moments to gather her thoughts and then set off slowly down the trail. \n\nIt was pitch black, and she jumped at every noise, but slowly and surely she made her way back towards the trailhead. She knew that she and Sarah had only been four or five miles in to the Bayou, so it shouldn't take more than a couple of hours to get back to where they had parked, even in the dark. It couldn't have been more that 15 minutes however when Dana spotted a light flickering through the trees. She hurried down the trail towards the light and discovered that it was coming from a single dim bulb mounted above the doorway of a small rest area building. Actually, calling it a rest area, or even a building, was pretty generous. Dana recalled that she and Sarah had passed through here on the hike in, not long before the attack. It was really just an old outhouse type bathroom with only the one light on the outside and an old drinking fountain. Dana had filled her water bottle up there earlier, and Sarah had called her crazy for drinking what she said was guaranteed to be swamp water. It had tasted fine to Dana. Actually, Dana thought, she could use some fresh water to wash the taste of swamp out of her mouth. She walked over to the fountain and depressed the lever, but no water came out. That struck her as odd, because it had been working earlier, but she figured she just couldn't count on the reliability of swamp plumbing. \n\nDana took another few minutes to rest in the small lighted clearing. After digging through what was left of her bag and finding that whatever the gator hadn't eaten had been ruined by the water, she started back down the trail. Two horribly long and dark hours later, Dana found herself in the small dirt parking lot for the trail-head. Sarah's car was gone, which she should have expected. Sarah most likely thought she was dead and had gone to get help."}

If convicted, they will likely face the death penalty.\n\"We will ensure that the rights of the accused persons will be respected and they will receive a fair trial,\" Huong's lawyer Hisyam Teh Poh Teik told reporters outside the courthouse.

This kind of technology should be known to everyone, especially kids in school.\r\n\r\nThis software knows every muscle in the face and understand the anatomy of these muscles. \" Movement of one or more muscles is called an 'action unit'. Then Dr. Huand relies on the work of psychlogists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facical Action Coding System). Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated with each characteristic movoments of the facial muscles.\" This process can read every muscle in the face and link an emotion with the given expression. It can even identify mixed emotions by weighing different units. For a human, isn't always easy to read mixed emotions.\r\n\r\n\"In fact, we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' every day.\" Yes, humans read peoples faces on a day to day basis and can usually figure out the nonverbal emotion of a person, but for a person who doesn't know anatomy, this can be hard to place the exact emotion with the facical expression they are looking at. This software can even tell when a person is faking a smile, which again, isn't always easy for a human to pick up on."}

{"text": "Driverless cars are coming and are closer than we think. Driverless cars are a phenomenal idea becauase they're innovative,all major car compaines are moving toward the driverless way and they're safe. This essay will disscuss these three reasons on why driverless cars are a phenomenal idea.\r\n\r\nFirst driverless cars are overwhelmingly innovative. It states in the passage \"Originally,many futurists believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday wasn't so much smarter cars as smarter roads\". This is putting into perspective that even futurists didn't believe it was possible but Google has achieved this monument to perfection. Also in the ariticle it says \"founder of the Google Car project, believes that the technology has finally begun to catch up to the dream\". As the original founder of this project he has even reached the level of innovation that he has been striving and working for since 2009.\r\n\r\nSecondly alot of major car companies are striving for making their product driveless. For example in the passage it conveys \"Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time\". This is shownig how a major car company as innovative as Tesla is going to release a self driving car of their own. In that same paragraph it informs \"Mercendes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020\". Showing that even some of the luxury brands and the major car compaines are releasing a driverless car. Showing how they agreee with where the future is going and how much of a phenomenal idea it is."}

{"text": "Salient object detection (SOD) aims to model the mechanism of human visual attention and mine the most salient objects or regions in data such as images or videos. SOD has been widely applied in many computer vision tasks, such as scene classification [39] , video segmentation [14] , semantic segmentation [44] , foreground map evaluation [11, 12] visual tracking [31] , person reidentification [40] and so on.\nWith the advent of the fully convolutional network [30] , deep learning-based SOD models [18, 28] have made great progress. Some methods [51, 34, 23, 52] have achieved very good performance on the existing benchmark datasets. However, these works are mainly based on RGB data. They still face severe challenges when handling the cluttered or low-contrast scenes. Recently, some works [6, 9, 54, 38, 15, 2, 4] introduce the depth data as an aid to further improve the detection performance. The depth information can more intuitively express spatial structures of the objects in a scene and provide a powerful supplement for the detection and recognition of salient objects. Using complementary modal cues, the scene can be further deeply and intelligently understood. However, limited by the way of using the depth information, RGB-D salient object detection is still great challenging.\nIt is well known that RGB images contain rich appearance and detail information while depth images contain more spatial structure information. They complement each other for many vision tasks. RGB-D SOD approaches aim to formulate cross-modal fusion in different manners. Most of them integrate depth and RGB features by element-wise addition [4, 37] , concatenation [13, 3] and convolution operations [2, 43] . Some methods compute attention map [50] or saliency map [43] via a shallow or deep CNN network from pure depth images. Because of using the fixed parameters for different samples during the testing phase, the generalization capability of these models is weakened."}

{"text": "In recent years, deep neural networks have achieved unprecedented success across a wide variety of domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, and automatic speech recognition. Unfortunately, as these networks continue to improve and surpass human-level performance, the computational resources and memory usage required also increases as the architecture becomes more complex. To reduce the model size and accelerate inference operations, many researchers have attempted diverse compression techniques such as network quantization (Courbariaux et al., 2016) and network pruning (Han et al., 2016) . In this paper, we concentrate on network quantization due to the advantage that INT4 or INT8 quantization allows us to accelerate quantized neural networks using off-the-shelf accelerators such as the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU (Wu et al., 2020) or ARM Cortex MCUs (Kim et al., 2021) .\nNetwork quantization techniques can be broadly divided into two categories: quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ). QAT is a method where the quantization of the networks is incorporated during the trianing process, as proposed by various research works such as Jung et al. (2019) ; Jain et al. (2019) ; Zhao et al. (2020) ; Esser et al. (2020) ; Lee et al. (2021) . We note that QAT results in a marginal performance difference between the full-precision and quantized versions of the neural network. Yet, QAT requires end-to-end retraining or fine-tuning on a full training dataset, which often causes an enormous amount of time and resources to obtain a quantized neural network with competitive performance. Furthermore, a whole training dataset may not be available due to data privacy issues or demands to utilize legacy models. Such drawbacks of QAT are the reasons why researchers recently pay more attention to PTQ (Zhao et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020; Nahshan et al., 2021) that needs neither a full training dataset nor end-to-end learning at all. PTQ had been initially performed via rounding-to-nearest by minimizing the quantization error in the parameter space. However, this approach suffers from severe performance degradation. Since it is reported that the loss degradation resulting from quantization can be approximated as the second-order error in Taylor Expansion by viewing quan-tized weights as perturbed weights, Nagel et al. (2020) and Li et al. (2021) substantiate that reconstructing each output of layer or block is equivalent to minimizing the approximation of loss degradation resulting from quantization under some assumptions. Accordingly, recent works (Nagel et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021; Hubara et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2022) have suggested to reconstruct each output of layer or block by devising and learning a new weight-rounding scheme, deviating from rounding-to-nearest, as an effort to preserve the performance of a full-precision model even after PTQ. However, all those new rounding schemes designed in existing studies either round or quantize pre-trained weights adaptively via element-wise addition.\nWe propose a novel post-training weight quantization method, called FlexRound, which departs from the typical element-wise addition approaches and instead employs an element-wise division perspective."}

It be awesome to read somebody's emotions thorugh a machine. it would tell you alot about what a person is feeling and thats important to know. their are many excellent and well reasoned examples of why this technology is valuable.\r\n\r\nMy one reason i believe this is valuable technology is if somebody was feeling depressed and was not willing to open up to anybody that individual could do self harm to himself. If they know how that individual was feeling maybe they would have helped he/she. in the passage it says \" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused and bored\". Then Dr. Huang says\" then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. This technology could become really usful for many different situations. Thats one of the reasons of why this makes this machine so valuable.\r\n\r\nThe creator of FACS[ [Facial Action Coding System] Dr. Paul Eckman has \"classified six basic emotions\". The machine can read happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. this type of technology can aid and solve world wide problem. For example what if an individual person or more were having issues with a certain subject at school but dont know how to ask for help. The Computer would make \" 3-D computer model of the face\" and they can anaylze what they might be feeling about the subject. then thats when the help comes.\r\n\r\nAnother example is reading different emotions is some how very important.

{"text": "Nowadays, users tend to have accounts in multiple social networks simultaneously for different services. For example, users may use LinkedIn to hunt for a job while adopting Instagram to share their daily life. Identifying linked accounts across different social networks enables us to integrate dispersed user information and provides a comprehensive understanding of user behavior, which will benefit many downstream implications, such as user profile modeling and cross-platform recommendation [19] . However, the correspondences among users different accounts, a.k.a. anchor links, are generally unavailable due to the independence of different social networks. Therefore, user identity linkage has become an increasingly popular area of research.\nUser information in social networks typically includes network structure (i.e., social connection), profile (e.g., screen name, location), and content (e.g., post), revealing different aspects of a single user. Some methods [11, 25, 17, 15, 12, 31] use a single type of information. A single type of information may be noisy and incomplete, and suffers from inconsistency across different social networks [19] . Some methods [6, 26, 13, 29, 20, 27] explore the mechanisms to fuse multiple types of information. Multiple types of information may be complementary to each other.\nExisting works focusing on information fusion can be divided into two categories, embedding based methods [20, 27, 22, 23] and nonembedding based methods [6, 26, 13, 29] . Non-embedding based methods usually define hand-crafted features for every single type of information independently and combine them in a supervised or semi-supervised fashion [6, 13] . This paradigm fails to capture the deep semantic of user information and the rich interaction among different information. Unlike the former, embedding based methods [18, 3] seek to learn a low-dimensional vector representation for a user that preserves the characteristics of the original data. The vector representation can significantly reduce the cost of computation and storage, and can be easily incorporated with deep learning to obtain a flexible model.\nStill, there remain two main problems for embedding based methods. First, none of them provide a general solution to fuse all three types of information, structure, profile and content. The embedding of network structure has been well-studied [15, 12, 2] , and recently some works explore the joint embedding of structure and profile [20, 27] , or structure and content [22] ."}
{"text": "When faced with a distributed control problem, one notices an acute lack of dedicated numerical tools, if compared with the classical, centralized design context. Several computational methods, such as those proposed in [1] - [4] , aim to exploit specialized techniques, in order to mitigate the numerical complexities inherent to distributed control.\nNotably, previous efforts [5] have sought to enforce sparsity constraints directly upon a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) approximation of the Youla parameter, under certain restrictive assumptions, such as Quadratic Invariance (QI) and strong stabilizability (see [6] ). However, the technique proposed in Section 5 of [5] cannot cope with enforcing sparsity patterns upon non-sparse affine expressions of the Youla parameter.\nThese issues were tackled in [7] , with the introduction of the framework dubbed System-Level Synthesis (SLS). Yet the focus on discrete-time systems meant that other architectures, such as the Network Realization Function (NRF) representations discussed in [8] , [9] , have been overshadowed by the FIR approximation methods from the SLS framework."}

Debido al coche de seguridad provocado por el accidente de Ericsson el alemán perdió su posición con Bottas ya que decidió entrar en boxes y poner ruedas nuevas. Aunque finalmente recuperó el liderato de la carrera con un gran adelantamiento que pillo desprevenido a Valtteri que se estaba defendiendo a las mil maravillas. Sebastian logró su cuarta victoria de la temporada y supera a Fernando Alonso en victorias con Ferrari, el cuatro veces campeón del mundo está a tan solo tres de Lauda para convertirse en el segundo piloto con más victorias con la escudería italiana. Vettel llegará al Gran Premio de Alemania como líder del mundial.\nLewis Hamilton: El inglés logró la pole pero no le dio resultado esta vez en el Gran Premio de su casa. Hamilton salió mal y perdió dos posiciones y dos curvas después Kimi se lo llevó por delante y cayó al decimoctavo lugar. Aun así, la carrera que nos regaló Lewis fue brutal, logrando una de las mejores remontadas de su carrera y demostrando que ha sido el piloto más rápido sobre este circuito. El inglés acabó la carrera en un meritorio segundo puesto que le permitió salvar los muebles ya que su rival directo Vettel ganó la carrera. Remontada de libro de Hamilton que se lleva a casa un merecido segundo puesto y a pesar de que no haya podido lograr su quinta victoria consecutiva en Silverstone, su carrera ha sido para no parar de aplaudir. Lewis tiene la oportunidad ahora de devolverle la victoria en territorio hostil a Vettel en dos semanas en el Gran Premio de Alemania.\nFernando Alonso: Una vez más el piloto español se volvió a lucir en un circuito en el que su coche era de los peores de la parrilla. Fernando no llegó la Q3 pero a pesar de clasificar en decimotercer lugar se mostró muy contento con el resultado logrado. Alonso confiaba en sumar puntos en el día de hoy y lo logró de nuevo con una espectacular carrera, rodando en el ritmo de sus rivales directos como eran Haas, Renault y Force India. El asturiano finalizó la carrera de nuevo en octavo lugar y se llevó a casa cuatro puntos muy valiosos para McLaren. Alonso lo hizo otra vez, sacó partido de donde no se podía y logró puntos mientras que su compañero Vandoorne se vio claramente superado por él durante todo el fin de semana.\nSemáforo Amarillo\nKimi Raikkonen: Carrera agridulce para el finés que comenzó mal ya que se llevó por delante a Hamilton en la tercera curva. Raikkonen cayó al quinto puesto y recibió una sanción de diez segundos debido al toque con el inglés. El finés fue uno de los principales beneficiados por el coche de seguridad provocado por Ericcson debido a que fue el primero en parar y el que tenía los neumáticos más desgastados. Durante el coche de seguridad ambos Ferrari y ambos Red Bull pararon y Kimi le ganó la posición tanto a Verstappen como a Bottas y logró finalizar en tercer lugar. Un nuevo podio para Kimi, su tercer podio consecutivo, el finés sin duda está mejorando muchísimo comparándole con temporadas anteriores. Sexto podio de la temporada para Raikkonen que está ayudando y mucho al equipo Ferrari en el mundial de constructores. Aun así, su toque con Hamilton en la primera vuelta creó mucha polémica y tensión entre ambos pilotos aunque el finés reconociera su error.\nNico Hulkenberg: Hulkenberg salvó los muebles de Renault este fin de semana en Silverstone, el alemán volvió a ser el mejor de los mortales logrando una gran sexta plaza y recuperando el séptimo puesto en el mundial. Nico se mostró algo flojo durante los entrenamientos libres y sufrió para pasar la Q2 en la clasificación."}

Les aides directes aux agriculteurs, dont la France est le principal bénéficiaire, seraient moins importantes et réorientées vers les petites exploitations. Les «réductions modérées» proposées sont de 5 % pour la Politique agricole commune (PAC) et de 7 % pour la politique de cohésion, les deux principaux postes budgétaires de l'UE. Des annonces qui ont suscité la colère de plusieurs pays, dont la France. Elle «ne pourra accepter aucune baisse de revenu direct pour les agriculteurs», a rapidement réagi le ministère de l'Agriculture dans un communiqué, déplorant une «baisse, drastique, massive et aveugle» et des mesures «inacceptables».\nMême son de cloche du côté de la Fédération nationale des syndicats d'exploitants agricoles. Christiane Lambert, sa présidente a évoqué une «grande déception» : «On dit que c'est -5 % mais c'est -10 % avec l'inflation. Face aux nouvelles priorités, c'est la politique agricole qui trinque alors qu'on lui demande toujours plus : qu'elle soit plus verte, qu'elle monte en gamme et qu'elle lutte contre le changement climatique, c'est inexplicable !» La Coordination rurale a également partagé la position du ministre de l'Agriculture, jugeant «inacceptables» les propositions de la Commission.\n«Ce n'est pas un massacre»\nJean-Claude Junker a pourtant défendu «un budget ambitieux, mais équilibré, juste pour tous».\nLe président de la Commission européenne estime aussi que les coupes proposées ne sont pas un «massacre», faisant valoir la nécessité d'augmenter les financements dans d'autres domaines comme la défense, la recherche ou la protection des frontières extérieures. Pour ce faire, le budget proposé par l'exécutif européen est même en hausse : il devrait s'établir à 1 279 milliards d'euros pour la période 2021-2027, contre 1 087 milliards pour les années 2014-2020. Ce, malgré la perte de l'importante contribution britannique. Les propositions de la Commission européenne, et notamment les coupes dans la politique de cohésion, ont provoqué l'ire de nombreux autres pays. Certains comme la Pologne se sentent aussi visés par le gel des aides aux pays violant l'État de droit, une mesure proposée pour la première fois par Bruxelles."}

{"text": "John Hickenlooper still considers Washington to be a lousy place, even as he prepares to ask voters to send him to the nation’s capital for a six-year gig as U.S. senator.\n“I had to make a decision,” the former governor and Denver mayor said in an interview Thursday morning, hours after kicking off his campaign. “Do I just criticize Washington? Do I go and fix it? I spent a lot of time thinking and a lot of time talking to Robin and I decided this is no time to walk away.”\nHickenlooper says he spoke with many dozens of people, including Colorado’s senior U.S. senator, before announcing his run for Senate on Thursday. He and Sen. Michael Bennet, a fellow Denver Democrat and his former chief of staff, had a long conversation about it in Iowa.\n“I had to think through what it would be like,” Hickenlooper said. “Would I be good at it? Would I like it? Could I make a difference? Everything I’ve ever done in public life has been about: where can I be of use? Where can I have the most impact? And if you look at it, what Washington probably needs right now in the Senate, more than anything, is people who have that experience of getting people together, finding common ground and getting things done.”\nHickenlooper has said that he would not, in fact, be good at it. In a news clip widely distributed by Republican groups on social media Thursday, Hickenlooper said in February that he wasn’t cut out to be a senator. When asked about that Thursday, Hickenlooper returned to criticisms of Washington and said his desire to serve Colorado is stronger than his dislike of D.C.\n“I certainly said it’s a lousy place if you’re a guy like me who likes to get things done. I still believe that. But I had a decision to make and this is, I think, a crucial time for Colorado and a crucial time for this country. Was I willing to go back to Washington and try to fix it? Try and get people to work together, just as I tried to do as mayor of Denver, just as I tried to do as governor? I spent a lot of time thinking about it and I (decided) this is the wrong time for good people to walk away.”\nIn the interview, Hickenlooper repeatedly criticized Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, as a roadblock to even incremental progress. When asked how he plans to pass legislation in McConnell’s Senate, Hickenlooper laughed and said, “You make sure Mitch McConnell’s not the majority leader going forward.” Then his tone returned to seriousness.\n“You have two choices: One, you just make some popcorn and give up; or the other is that you start to build relationships with other Republicans. You try to look for other ways of approaching the different issues,” Hickenlooper said. But, he cautioned, “I’m not saying I’m a magician.”\nHickenlooper becomes the 12th candidate in the crowded Democratic field for Senate."}
{"text": "Les jeunes veulent des aventures. Dieu les pardonne. Malheureusement, des marxistes cinquantenaires ayant passé l'âge des gamineries s'enfoncent dans un infantilisme certain : ils ne veulent pas vieillir (pour X raison). Cette juvénilisation doit s'incarner, prendre corps. Pour cela... Ahed Tamimi. Cependant une telle incarnation étouffe dans l'oeuf la possibilité de la réussite du mouvement dont elle doit apparemment assurer le salut – mouvement anti-infantiliste à la base.\nAhed Tamimi est une jeune palestinienne qu'on ne présente plus. Elle fut célébrisée bien malgré elle (?) le jour où (après qu'elle eut giflé un militaire) des policiers israéliens l'enfermèrent en ignorant qu'aller opérer (en l'espèce) un effet Streisand et que tous les médias se concentreraient sur son activisme particulier.\nOr, comme certains ont pu le remarquer, l'amour soudain des Occidentaux pour la jeune fille n'est pas un hasard. En vérité, il est même très clair : Ahed Tamimi est Katniss Everdeen1.\nEt la raison de sa célébrité est due à la « katniss-everdeenation » des esprits.\nCeci consiste dans le simple fait qu'avec la juvénilisation des combats, à savoir l'association fabuleuse de la jeunesse à la rebellitude, on peut aisément faire le parallèle entre, d'une part, la jeune palestinienne, et de l'autre, les Harry Potter, les Katniss Everdeen, et que sais-je encore (ou comme les personnages de Le Labyrinthe, de 2014, film immonde s'il en est).\nUne fois encore, le processus s'avère courant. On a affaire, de fil en aiguille, à la mythisation de l'événement qui, à cause de sa structure intrinsèquement pauvre, doit, par l'imagination des foules, s'enjoliver en archétypant ses figures principales. Ainsi Ahed Tamimi devient-elle Katniss, c'est-à-dire la surchrétienne révoltée (car qui sont Katniss Everdeen et Ahed Tamimi, sinon des marxistes – donc des sur/subchrétiennes – qui s'ignorent ?).\nEn fait, cette mythisation d'une histoire banale ne relève pas du hasard. Plutôt, le mythe donne le nord et le sud. Ce faisant, ses partisans apprécient les gestes d'Ahed Tamimi dans la mesure où elle imite Katniss Everdeen (par conséquent dès lors qu'elle imite Jésus-Christ, puisque Katniss Everdeen – bien qu'elle ne soit pas noire et/ou handicapée – est une réactualisation christique en tant que libératrice du mal).\nLa seule chose – peut-être inquiétante – est non pas qu'il y a eu mythisation d'un personnage actuel ce qui, à vrai dire, est plutôt courant. En revanche, ce qui est inquiétant, c'est bien le fait qu'à tout prendre les politiques et les badauds optent davantage pour une historiette juvénile (The Hunger Games), cryptoreligieuse, en lieu et place d'une franche histoire religieuse, à savoir un mythe « en soi ». Et comme toujours, pencher pour un mythème (« Ahed Everdeen, ou Katniss Tamimi est la rebelle sacrée ») dégradé par rapport au mythème originel est un signe de dégradation générale de la conscience2 qu'on entretient par rapport à soi.\nSi bien que, au niveau de l'intellectualité, les agents de communication propalestiniens devraient y réfléchir à deux fois : comment peut-on prendre au sérieux une jeune fille lors même qu'on juvénilise davantage (afin de faire correspondre au mode de pensée – arabe comme européenne – « capitaliste ») cette jeune fille dont on prétend qu'elle incarne un combat sérieux ?\nSoit elle est importante, dans ce cas devant nécessairement suivre une modalité d'existence médiatique spéciale basée sur la condition usuelle de la sériosité (style académique, etc., serait-il singé), soit elle est au fond comme ceux qui l'utilisent à profit : des enfants ennuyés par l'absence générale de motivations existentielles.\nEn somme, ceux derrière Ahed Tamimi, pourrait-on dire, sont désespérés de ne pas faire partie d'une histoire...\nPar conséquent, ils s'inventent une vie par la voie de la facilité... Le capitalisme !\nCe qui est d'autant plus paradoxal que la critique originelle des propalestiniens touche au mode même du fonctionnement du capitalisme juvénile au moyen duquel, selon eux, la dualité Israël-Etats-Unis prospéreraient."}

Ron Mott, a reporter from the Today Show, says that the Zoo is closely monitoring the pachyderm’s girth.\nNearly 75 percent of elephants are overweight according to a study of Zoo animals from 2011. Raja, the St. Louis Zoo’s famous 26-year-old elephant, is one of the overweight elephants. He weighs anywhere from 9,500 lbs to 10,500 lbs. The Zoo says that although he is a large elephant, he is in good condition.\nToday reports that the St. Louis Zoo came up with a recipe to keep the pound off. They’re using feeders that force the animals to work for food. They’re also eating smaller, more frequent meals, and switching up the locations of some snacks.\nThe goal is to keep active. The elephants appear to enjoy exercise with the reward of a treat.\nThe changes put in place for the Zoo’s Asian elephants appear to be working. They have minimized weight-related problems like joint and foot issues.\nThe St. Louis Zoo posted a picture to Twitter of the news crew at the Zoo."}
{"text": "A long time ago, I heard a story about the origin of Obi Wan. A few Star Wars fans had noticed a similarity between the sound of his name and that of some of the other characters. \n\nA couple of examples are C3PO and R2D2. They're also call Artoo and Threepio for short. Now take Obiwan's name and run this idea in the other direction Obi Wan could also be OB1. It was theorized that this might indicate some kind of as-yet-unrevealed backstory that Obi Wan was a clone of some sort. \n\nSo I ran with the idea. And it started to make it's own kind of sense the more I thought about it. It goes something like this. \n\nOnce upon a time, a small group of Jedi got an idea. Let's take advantage of this new cloning technology and try and clone ourselves. Just as was done later with Jango Fett, the clones were to be based on a superior example. The Jedi selected a young Jedi Master named *Ben* Kenobi. \n\nThe location for the cloning facility was an obscure planet just south of the Rishi Maze named Kamino. There, the Jedi requested the clones to be produced in batches of 100 clones each. Each clone would have it's own unique alphanumeric designation according to it's unit number within each batch. The very first clone to be produced in this fashion would therefore be known as Original Batch, number one. Or OB1, for short. \n\nBen Kenobi gave his DNA sample to the Kaminoans and the process got underway. Unfortunately for the Jedi, there was a problem. It was the midichlorians. In a totally unforeseen turn of events, the midichlorians did not replicate along with the rest of the body's cell during the cloning process. There was only one single multiplication instead of the hundred that was expected. \n\nWhat's more, only one of the clones received the these midichlorians. The first clone, OB1. The rest of the clones came out of the process physically complete and perfect in every way except the one that mattered most. They had not one single midichlorian amongst the lot. Ninety-nine clones of Ben Kenobi, completely lacking in any Jedi powers whatsoever. It was a disaster and the whole project was immediately canceled..... never to be mentioned again. Even the location of Kamino itself was deleted from the Jedi library. The 99 powerless clones were quitely relocated. Each one to a separate planet, scattered across the far reaches of the Republic. \n\nThere was one small success though. OB1. Based on an already powerful Jedi, but with twice the level of midichlorians. The young OB1 was renamed Obi Wan and entered into Jedi training at the earliest possible age. As young Obi Wan progressed through his training the Jedi council came to realize that he would soon be a very powerful Jedi. \n\nWhen OB1 became the Paduwan of Qui Gonn Jinn, Ben Kenobi retired to a far off world called Tatooine. This was done in order to avoid the rest of the Jedi from noticing that he had been cloned. \n\nEventually OB1, now known as Obi Wan, came to fulfill his potential. He was in fact, a type of super Jedi. A few years passed and the time came when the Sith chose to reveal themselves."}
{"text": "Since the inception and uptake of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the 90s and early 00s, much neurolinguistic research has been undertaken to discover the neural correlates of speech production and perception [1] . A concurrent improvement to existing electroencephalography (EEG) technology has improved access and lowered cost, and neurolinguistic research has gradually shifted in its favour. However, for decoding inner and imagined speech, many EEG studies note the processing advantages that are gained from the signals offered by fMRI data (e.g. [2, 3, 4] ). As such, a nascent interest in combining the two modalities has emerged: for speech and language processing, bimodal fusion methods have more recently been applied to paradigms for auditory decoding from oddball paradigms [5, 6] , speech-gesture integration [7, 8] , and speech and language mapping [9, 10] .\nBoth recording modalities have their own benefits: EEG has fine-grained millisecond temporal accuracy of up to 16,000 Hz, but limited spatial resolution. In contrast, fMRI has high 1mm spatial precision, but weak temporal resolution. Combining these two modalities can compensate for their individual limitations, and has been shown to improve decoding performance over unimodal decoding [11] .\nWhilst fMRI has been used extensively to investigate the neural correlates of speech (e.g. [12, 13, 14] ), it is only recently gaining traction for brain-computer interface (BCI)-motivated inner speech decoding. Using three subjects, Tang et al. [15] demonstrate how fMRI may successfully be used to reconstruct perceived continuous natural language based on its semantic representation; the decoder was used to subsequently identify, via pair-wise classification, which of five story transcripts the participant was imagining. Other support for fMRI-based language decoding comes from Correia et al.'s study in which spoken words were shown to be decodable across languages based on semantic representations [16] .\nEEG is also an increasingly-popular BCI tool for inner speech decoding; recently, van den Berg et al. [17] report a 35% model accuracy with a 4-class inner speech decoding paradigm, while Kiroy et al. [18] report model accuracies from 33% to 40% with a 7-class inner speech task-notably both of these studies employed paradigms restricted to 'spatial direction' words. Decoding performances have also been shown to remain stable with commercial-grade dry electrode EEG devices which record the brain signal with lower fidelity and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): Clayton et al."}
