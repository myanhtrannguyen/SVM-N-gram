{"text": "Here's a restructured and improved version of the text:\n\n**The Privacy and Ethical Concerns of Emotional Recognition Technology in Education**\n\nUsing emotional recognition technology in classrooms represents a significant violation of students' fundamental rights to privacy and personal space. While the technology can create detailed 3D models of faces and analyze 44 facial muscles to detect emotions, this capability raises serious ethical concerns in an educational setting.\n\nThe process itself is inefficient and disruptive to learning. Creating 3D facial models and performing complex calculations isn't instantaneous—it requires valuable classroom time that should be spent on actual instruction and test preparation. Moreover, emotions are dynamic, changing frequently throughout the day, making such measurements potentially meaningless shortly after they're taken.\n\nConsider how we naturally handle emotional situations: when a friend is upset, we might notice their expression and gently ask if they're okay. If they prefer not to discuss it, we respect their privacy and give them space. Using technology to forcibly decode someone's emotional state contradicts this basic human courtesy. Unlike the Mona Lisa, which is a static painting unable to consent to emotional analysis, students are living individuals with the right to choose how and when they express their feelings.\n\nThe classroom should remain a space for learning, not a laboratory for emotional surveillance. While emotional recognition technology might have legitimate applications in medical settings or specialized fields, its implementation in schools would compromise student privacy and autonomy."}

The child grew in darkness, cold and frightened, knowing nothing of the world beyond ash and rubble.\n\nAt twelve years old, she spotted a glittering toy—a promise of happiness in the desolate landscape. She ran toward it, her feet sinking into the sands of the ruined city. The world wept as man's cruel device sealed both her fate and its own.

That slow drag of monotony had just drank the fun from my life. Every day was a schedule. Get up. Walk the dog. Shower and get dressed. Pick up the carpool. Drive to work. Work. Lunch. Work. Drive carpool home. Pick up mail. Take out trash. Pick up take out from a locally recommended diner. Watch something on TV till we fell asleep. Have sex once a month. On the first Monday of the month, I could tell you exactly where I was going to be, what I was going to be doing, and with whom it would be, for the next 30 days.\n\nI didn't like her anymore. I didn't want to be with her anymore. I was done! I was free! I was finally on my own.\n\nThe hardest part of being on your own is actually being on your own and realizing that no one else was there to make me happy. I did miss her being there. I didn't miss her conversation or anything else about her really. She was kind of funny, kind of intelligent, and kind of kind. I felt myself wanting more though. I wanted to really laugh. I wanted to really think. I wanted to really be nice. In short, I wanted more out of the life I had.\n\nI didn't want that anymore. She didn't want that anymore. More importantly, we didn't want that with each other anymore. So, I moved out. I moved into an apartment closer to work. I don't have to carpool anymore. I just walk 15 minutes, take in some sun, and feel pleasantly refreshed. It's been two weeks. I'm getting more done at work. I am enjoying trying some restaurants I found in a book at the library. Oh yeah, I'm reading more now too.\n\nTwo weeks in, and I need to make the next step. I need to start moving on. I left my phone at our old place, but I just couldn't go back to get it. I mean, I want her to be happy and all, and I am genuinely happy for her, but there is a chance that I will lose my resolve and fall blissfully back into the warm hands of stagnation once more. At my lunch break, I head to the Apple store and buy a new phone. Working with the Apple Genius, we go through my options, and luckily, I had an iCloud backup I could sync my new phone with from my old phone. The Genius re-installed my apps and asked if he wanted to automatically re-accept all my permissions and settings."}

{"text": "Here's the polished version, maintaining the eerie atmosphere while improving flow and clarity:\n\nGrowing up, my parents were rarely present. We had recently moved to an affluent neighborhood in a new town, and they worked endless hours to maintain our lifestyle. I struggle to remember the last time we shared a meal together. Perhaps it was inevitable that I created an imaginary friend. I named her Abby.\n\nShe became my closest confidante—a living diary of sorts—and I grew increasingly dependent on her. She claimed to need me just as much, and there's something intoxicating about feeling indispensable to someone.\n\nThen one day, without warning, she vanished. An emptiness consumed me, which I attributed to the familiar ache of loneliness. Sleep became my refuge; consciousness was too painful to bear.\n\nAfter a week's absence, Abby returned—but changed. A cold distance had replaced her warmth, and anger simmered beneath her words. She insisted she had outgrown me, that I needed to leave. She no longer *needed* me; my role in her life was complete.\n\nI should have recognized the warning signs, but I was distracted by an overwhelming sensation of fading away.\n\nI pleaded with her to stay, explaining how vital she was to me—that I couldn't bear another loss after my parents' emotional absence. She remained unmoved, offering only a hollow promise to remember me before departing one final time.\n\nAs the door closed behind her, searing pain ripped through me, bringing me to my knees. I dragged myself to a nearby cabinet, leaning against it as I fought back tears. Within moments, the terrible truth began to reveal itself.\n\nMy hand started to shimmer. At first, I blamed it on tears, but even after wiping my eyes, the ethereal glow remained. I watched, transfixed, as it crept up my arms and enveloped my entire body in intensifying light.\n\nOne might expect panic, but I felt only numbness, staring at my luminescent form in detached fascination.\n\nRemember that earlier warning sign I'd missed? Understanding finally dawned as my hand—the first to glow—began to fade. The process started subtly, like viewing it through frosted glass, but progressed until my hand simply ceased to exist, leaving what appeared to be a stump. As my scattered thoughts crystallized into horrible clarity, I finally understood the truth.\n\nShe wasn't my imaginary friend. *I was hers.*"}

The certification came after Democratic incumbent Anthony Brindisi's concession, marking the end of a grueling 97-day post-election battle.\n\nA state judge recently confirmed Tenney's razor-thin margin of 109 votes in the district, which encompasses central New York including Utica. Tenney, who will reclaim the seat she first won in 2014 before losing to Brindisi in 2018, has drawn attention for controversial positions, including skepticism about climate change and allegations about \"deep state\" involvement in former HUD Secretary Ben Carson's office expenditures.\n\nWhile New York's electoral system is notorious for its slow vote counting—with some Democratic primaries taking up to six weeks to resolve—the extraordinary delay in NY-22 stemmed from the exceptionally close margin and complex legal disputes over contested ballots. As reported by the New York Times, the process was plagued by a series of concerning irregularities:\n\n- Officials discovered dozens of uncounted ballots weeks after Election Day\n- Oneida County failed to process over 2,400 voter registration applications, disenfranchising those voters\n- The infamous \"StickyGate\" controversy emerged when Post-it notes used to mark disputed ballots mysteriously disappeared, creating uncertainty about which ballots had been counted\n\nThough Brindisi could have pursued further legal challenges or appealed to the House of Representatives, his concession narrows the Democratic House majority to just nine seats. With NY-22 resolved, five congressional seats remain vacant—three previously held by Democrats who joined the Biden administration, and two formerly held by Republicans who succumbed to COVID-19 after the election."}

Its prominence stems from the ability to provide ubiquitous wireless coverage and uninterrupted service, particularly in regions beyond terrestrial cellular network coverage [1].\n\nSatellites can be categorized into three main types based on orbital height:\n- Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites\n- Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites\n- Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites\n\nWhile LEO satellites offer smaller coverage compared to their GEO and MEO counterparts, they present compelling advantages:\n- Reduced over-the-air delay\n- Lower path loss due to shorter link distance\n- More cost-effective deployment\n\nThese benefits have positioned mega-constellation LEO satellite systems as a promising technology for achieving global seamless communication service with substantial business potential.\n\n## Industry Developments and Standardization\n\nThe growing market opportunities have sparked numerous proposals from companies like OneWeb, Kuiper, and Starlink to deploy LEO satellite mega-constellations for global broadband access. Concurrently, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has initiated standardization efforts to integrate 5G New Radio (NR) with non-terrestrial networks (NTN) using satellite access:\n\n- Release 15: Identified deployment scenarios, channel models, and key NR impact areas [2]\n- Release 16: Studied features and modifications for NR adaptation in NTN [3]\n- Releases 17 and 18: Ongoing work addressing NR-based protocol challenges and NTN-specific performance enhancements\n\n## Beam Hopping Technology\n\nBeam hopping has emerged as a flexible technique in satellite communication, designed to address time-varying traffic demands of ground-based user equipment (UEs) while reducing payload weight and costs. This approach introduces a new dimension for improving communication performance by strategically illuminating specific portions of the satellite coverage area [4].\n\nKey advantages include:\n- Dynamic satellite resource adjustment\n- Reduced inter-beam interference\n- Potential for full bandwidth reuse with higher capacity\n\nThe industry has made significant progress in beam hopping implementation:\n- DVB-S2X standard introduced three frame structures (Formats 5-7) supporting beam hopping [5]\n- System-level simulations demonstrated beam hopping potential using a GEO satellite with 14 beams [6]\n- Advanced frameworks, such as cooperative multiagent deep reinforcement learning, have been proposed for optimizing beam hopping patterns and bandwidth allocation [7]\n\n## Current Research Focus\n\nThis paper examines an NR-based mega-constellation LEO satellite communication system utilizing satellites equipped with phased array antennas."}

While some speculated about alien life forms, the explanation proved far more straightforward.\n\nUpon closer examination of these formations, researchers noted a consistent pattern: the apparent eyes, nose, and mouth were consistently darker than the surrounding \"face\" area. Scientists ultimately demonstrated that these facial features were simply shadows cast by the natural terrain.

However, the author's argument is undermined by an overwhelming focus on dangers rather than benefits, creating an unbalanced perspective that ultimately works against the intended message.\n\n## Historical Context and Early Exploration\nVenus, often called Earth's \"twin\" due to similar density and size, has long fascinated scientists. NASA's early attempts to explore Venus revealed tantalizing possibilities: the planet may have once harbored oceans and potentially supported life, much like Earth. However, unmanned missions to Venus have historically faced severe challenges, with no spacecraft surviving longer than a few hours after landing. This three-decade gap in Venus missions raises questions about our current technological capabilities.\n\n## Environmental Challenges\nThe planet presents formidable obstacles to exploration:\n- A dense atmosphere of 97% carbon dioxide\n- Clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid\n- Surface temperatures averaging 800 degrees Fahrenheit\n- Atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than Earth's\n- Limited visibility through the dense atmosphere\n- Hostile geological conditions including active volcanoes, earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes\n\n## Technological Limitations\nThe extreme conditions on Venus pose unprecedented challenges for human technology:\n- Even deep-sea submarines would be crushed by Venusian pressure\n- Most metals would liquefy under the conditions\n- Sample collection remains impossible from a safe distance\n- Current probes cannot survive the harsh environment\n\n## Limited Arguments for Exploration\nThe author's case for exploring Venus relies primarily on two points:\n1."}

{"text": "Here's the polished version:\n\n# The Rising Threat of Phone Spoofing: What You Need to Know\n\nEvery minute, an estimated 50,000 robocalls are placed across the United States, according to national tracking groups. These operations are becoming increasingly sophisticated, employing deceptive tactics to increase answer rates—including using your own phone number to target others.\n\n## A Personal Experience\n\nThe familiar ring of a phone demands our attention, but recently, something unusual caught my attention. Multiple people contacted me claiming they had missed calls from my number. Upon checking my outgoing call log, I found no record of these calls.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we can't trust our caller ID like we used to,\" explains Mark Mattioli from the Attorney General's Office of Consumer Protection.\n\nInvestigation with consumer protection organizations, including the Better Business Bureau (BBB), revealed that scammers were hijacking my phone number for robocalls. We've since discovered similar schemes using our television station's numbers, falsely announcing contest wins to unsuspecting recipients.\n\n## How Phone Spoofing Works\n\nDan Buchta of the BBB explains that the process is remarkably simple. \"Readily available apps allow users to mask their true number and display any number they choose when making calls,\" he notes. The most prevalent form of this deception, according to Mattioli, involves impersonating the IRS.\n\n### Why Your Number?\n\nScammers can easily acquire and use any phone number, including yours. \"If they can obtain the IRS's number, they can obtain your number,\" Mattioli warns. Buchta adds, \"They use local numbers to increase the likelihood that you'll answer the call.\"\n\n## The Legal Gray Area\n\nSurprisingly, number spoofing technology—including voice modification and background noise addition—remains legal. The FCC permits spoofing unless it's used to fraudulently obtain valuables from the call recipient. However, Buchta points out that fraud is often the primary motivation: \"Much of spoofing is aimed at identity theft through gathering personal information.\"\n\nAttorney General Tom Fox, along with 27 other state attorneys general, is advocating for stricter FCC regulations to help individuals protect their numbers from misuse in pranks or scams.\n\n## Protecting Yourself\n\nBuchta recommends these essential safety measures:\n\n1. Never disclose personal information over the phone\n2. For necessary phone transactions involving personal data, ensure you initiated the call\n3. If something seems suspicious, end the call immediately. Independently verify the organization's number and call them back"}

{"text": "Here's the polished version of the text, enhanced for clarity and flow while maintaining the technical accuracy:\n\nIn this study, we examine the application of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) in indoor automation and control scenarios, specifically focusing on mmWave communication links that demand high reliability and low latency. The RIS serves as a signal bypass when the line-of-sight (LoS) connection between the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE) becomes obstructed.\n\nResearch by [1] and [2] demonstrates that active RIS systems achieve superior performance compared to passive RIS systems under equivalent power constraints. This advantage manifests in two ways: active RIS elements can either enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the UE while maintaining the same number of elements, or they can achieve the target SNR with fewer elements, thereby reducing both cost and size. Furthermore, a RIS with fewer elements can more rapidly adjust its configuration to accommodate mobile UE—a crucial feature for the time-sensitive automation and control applications that are central to this research.\n\nThe study presented in [2] introduces an active RIS designed for the mmWave frequency band, utilizing polarization transformation to improve isolation between incoming and reflected waves. While numerical simulations and anechoic chamber measurements show strong correlation in terms of radiation patterns and received power, further validation is needed. Specifically, testing RIS performance in indoor non-LoS (NLoS) scenarios with mobile UE remains essential for ensuring reliable BS-UE connectivity in industrial automation settings.\n\nResearch in [3] explores RIS-assisted indoor environments featuring mobile robots, considering scenarios with either numerous small RIS units or fewer large ones. Similarly, [4] examines mobile target tracking through motion parameter estimation. However, both studies remain theoretical and require experimental validation in real-world conditions.

While no spacecraft has landed on Venus in over three decades, some researchers are eager to change this status quo. However, the challenges of such a mission are significant and warrant careful consideration.\n\nVenus presents extreme conditions that make exploration particularly dangerous. With surface temperatures reaching 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the densest atmosphere of any planet in our solar system, it's arguably the most challenging destination for space exploration."}
{"text": "Here's the polished version:\n\n# The Case Against Driverless Cars\n\nI firmly oppose the implementation of driverless cars. While some human drivers already pose risks on the road, I believe automated systems wouldn't necessarily improve safety. Rather than embracing this technology out of convenience, people should maintain responsibility for their own transportation.\n\nOne significant concern is that these vehicles aren't truly autonomous. They still require human intervention in certain situations, creating a dangerous gray area of responsibility. If the system fails to alert the driver in time for manual override, the consequences could be catastrophic. Moreover, this technology might enable impaired individuals to attempt driving under the misguided assumption that the car's autonomous features will ensure their safety. A driver too intoxicated to respond to emergency takeover requests poses a severe safety risk.\n\nSecurity vulnerabilities present another critical issue. These computer-dependent vehicles could be susceptible to cyber attacks. Currently, skilled hackers can already breach smart vehicles' systems, remotely unlocking and starting cars without physical keys. With fully autonomous vehicles, the risks multiply exponentially. Malicious actors could potentially redirect vehicles, force collisions, or disable driver alerts—leaving uncertainty about whether to blame the driver, the vehicle, or the system itself.\n\nFurthermore, this technology could exacerbate society's growing dependence on automation. We're already seeing the negative effects of excessive reliance on technology, as portrayed in films like \"WALL-E,\" where humans become increasingly sedentary and disconnected from active participation in their lives. Driverless cars represent another step toward this concerning future.\n\nDespite ongoing technological advances and improvements in autonomous vehicle systems, I believe their potential drawbacks outweigh their benefits."}

While the formation does bear a resemblance to a human face, this effect is created by natural rock formations and shadows, not alien architects.\n\nNASA has thoroughly documented this phenomenon through increasingly detailed imagery. Initial photos taken at 43 meters per pixel, compared with newer high-resolution images at 1.56 meters per pixel, both confirm the same conclusion: we're looking at a natural geological formation. The face-like appearance is merely a result of light and shadow playing across the Martian landscape.\n\nThough this formation has captured public imagination for over 25 years—appearing in movies, books, magazines, and radio talk shows—it's crucial to separate entertainment from scientific fact. Just as we shouldn't believe everything we hear about celebrities, we shouldn't accept sensational claims without scientific evidence.\n\nSeveral key points refute the alien construction theory:\n\n- Mars has shown no evidence of current or recent life forms\n- NASA, which openly shares its discoveries, would have no reason to hide such a monumental finding\n- The formation's appearance changes significantly under different lighting conditions\n- Geological processes can explain the formation's characteristics\n\nThe Face on Mars serves as a reminder that while conspiracy theories can be compelling, they often crumble under scientific scrutiny. Just as Earth's natural formations can create striking patterns, Mars's landscape can produce seemingly familiar shapes through entirely natural processes."}

{"text": "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow, moving from broad concepts to specific challenges and approaches:\n\nQuantum computers offer the promise of executing some computational tasks exponentially faster than classical computers. This suggests a violation of the extended Church-Turing thesis, which says that any physically realizable model of computation can be efficiently simulated by a classical Turing machine. Indeed, quantum computers were originally proposed as a means of simulating quantum mechanical systems [1], a task considered classically hard. There has been much progress toward identifying classically difficult problems that quantum computers can solve efficiently, such as integer factorization [2], simulating Hamiltonian dynamics [3][4][5], and extracting information about solutions of high-dimensional linear systems [6].\n\nA significant milestone for the field of quantum computing is the first demonstration that a quantum device can perform computational tasks that a classical device with comparable resources cannot. This milestone has been called quantum supremacy [7, 8], quantum advantage, or a proof of quantumness [9], and has instigated numerous theoretical proposals and experimental efforts. However, there remain formidable technological challenges to building quantum computers, requiring both theoretical and experimental progress in architecture design, fault tolerance, and control.\n\nOne promising approach to demonstrating quantum advantage is analog quantum simulation [10], which involves using one many-body quantum system to simulate another. By building quantum systems with tunable (but perhaps non-universal) Hamiltonians, one can emulate a large class of Hamiltonians that may be difficult to simulate classically. Since it directly encodes hard problems into controllable quantum systems, analog simulation arguably mitigates many of the issues faced by digital approaches [11, 12]. Furthermore, analog simulation avoids Trotter error and other sources of algorithmic error in digital quantum simulation [13, 14]. Indeed, analog simulations of systems with hundreds of qubits have already been performed [15].\n\nVarious proposals for quantum advantage have addressed these challenges in different ways, by making trade-offs between ease of experimental demonstration, ease of verification, security guarantees, and practical applications. A major challenge for both quantum simulation and more general forms of quantum computation is the difficulty of verifying the correctness of a quantum process. While there have been several proposals to verify digital quantum computation [16, 17] based on the Feynman-Kitaev circuit-to-Hamiltonian mapping [18], such protocols are neither designed for analog quantum simulation nor practical on near-term analog quantum devices.\n\nPrevious work towards verifying analog simulation has suggested approaches such as cross-platform verification [19, 20], Hamiltonian learning [20], and performing a Loschmidt echo [20][21][22]. Unlike protocols for digital verification, these approaches can be spoofed by dishonest or inaccurate quantum simulators, and therefore cannot be used to demonstrate quantum advantage in a sound, efficiently verifiable way. A step toward verified analog simulation is made in [23], in which the verifier measures the energy of a parent Hamiltonian of the output state of analog quantum simulation."}

De plus en plus de personnes, à bout de forces, transgressent les règles sanitaires, creusant ainsi un fossé avec ceux qui dénoncent cette irresponsabilité.\n\nCe qui semblait être un poisson d'avril a pris une tournure sérieuse lorsque près de 2 000 personnes ont répondu à une invitation pour faire la fête dans un bois de Bruxelles. Malgré les avertissements sur la page Facebook concernant d'éventuelles poursuites judiciaires - la Belgique ayant renforcé ses restrictions pour lutter contre la propagation du Covid - les participants sont venus en nombre. La situation s'est tendue au point que la police a dû intervenir pour disperser la foule qui protestait contre la rigueur excessive des mesures sanitaires.\n\nDans ce climat tendu, même les traditionnelles blagues du 1er avril sont prises au sérieux. Deliveroo en a fait les frais : ses clients n'ont guère apprécié de recevoir de fausses factures exorbitantes - 466 euros pour 38 pizzas. Si la commande était fictive, l'inspiration venait probablement d'une réalité bien présente : la multiplication des fêtes clandestines.\n\nLes infractions aux restrictions se multiplient : apéros sauvages, cluster parties, soirées entre amis, compétitions sportives non autorisées, non-respect du couvre-feu... Bien que ces comportements ne soient pas nouveaux, ils se sont significativement intensifiés ces dernières semaines, particulièrement dans l'espace public avec l'arrivée des beaux jours.\n\nLe chanteur Kaddour Hadadi, connu sous le nom de HK, en a fait l'expérience avec son groupe les Saltimbanks. Il a dû interrompre sa tournée de solidarité avec les artistes occupant des lieux culturels, en raison de \"tensions et divisions\" croissantes. Sa chanson \"Danser encore\", critique envers le gouvernement qui considère la culture comme \"non-essentielle\", est devenue un hymne de contestation, provoquant partout des rassemblements festifs spontanés.\n\nFin mars, plusieurs villes comme Lyon, Lille et Rezé ont été le théâtre de fêtes sauvages et de carnavals non autorisés, suscitant de vives réprobations. La manifestation la plus marquante s'est déroulée dans le quartier de la Plaine à Marseille, rassemblant près de 6 500 fêtards, majoritairement jeunes et sans masque sanitaire."}

Growing up, you're taught that a mother's love for her child goes beyond worlds. In vice-versa, a child's love for its mother transcends dimensions. I never understood why everyone was so deeply infatuated with one another. Love never really meant much to me. \n\nI was different, though. I had never felt love, or compassion. My family pets would come and go. Live and die. Family members would drop off the planet like flies to a zapper, but I would always be the one sitting on that uncushioned bench, wearing a freshly pressed suit, unwavered by what was placed in front of me. Death.\n\nI guess that carried over with me in a lot of other things. Love. Friendship. Pride. It was all masked by this feeling deep within—almost, in a way, coming from nowhere and at the exact same time in a very distinct part just behind my sternum. It was a feeling of absence. In more of a way, I guess, it was a feeling of uncarring. Nothing mattered to me because I felt, well, nothing.\n\nThrough the last years of high school, all of the people I associated myself around, to appear normal, were going off with their dates. Just watching the three of them getting into a car, taking turns over whose date night it was with whose. It disgusted me. Love was never meant for me, it seemed. Nothing was.\n\nUntil I met her. Her name was Alysian (a-le-see-an). It was cute. Elegant. A name that caught your ear when you heard it. When I had met her, I asked for her name at least five times over. It never wanted to roll off my tongue until I finally blurted out Aslan. This amused her quite a bit and from this her nickname \"Lion\" was born.\n\nWe had talked it over with her and her boyfriend, Trey, and they agreed to add me to their relationship. It was nice for a while. Just us three. Everything was finally starting to feel normal to me. I had gotten a job over the summer at the local Lowe's Hardware Store. Bought a car nearing the end of it and we had all spent nearly every weekend with each other. Lion, Trey, and I all happy together. At the end of the summer we all talked about moving in with each other when we graduate. Being the seniors that we were, we couldn't wait to set this plan into motion.\n\nGraduation came.

As the Sun consumed our world, it consumed me too. I would reform briefly in its outer layers, only to perish almost instantly.

Research projections indicate this volume will reach billions of gigabytes daily by 2022 [1]. This data explosion presents opportunities for valuable artificial intelligence (AI) services through deep learning [2] and mobile edge computing [3], which have rapidly converged under the umbrella of mobile edge learning.\n\nMobile edge learning is poised to become a cornerstone technology for sixth-generation (6G) cellular networks, enabling transformative applications like virtual and augmented reality, thus realizing the vision of network intelligence [4], [5]. However, the centralized processing of such massive data volumes faces significant challenges, including network constraints, scalability issues, limited bandwidth, and critical privacy concerns.\n\n## Federated Edge Learning (FEEL)\n\nFederated edge learning (FEEL) has emerged as a promising solution for collaborative data processing at the network edge. This approach preserves user privacy by keeping data on client devices while sharing only local models [6]. Additionally, FEEL substantially reduces network traffic since users exchange only model parameters, which maintain consistent size and structure across users.\n\n### Challenges in FEEL Implementation\n\nSeveral key challenges affect FEEL's implementation:\n\n1. Convergence uncertainty\n2. Training round optimization\n3. Resource constraints (computation and communication)\n4. Energy limitations\n\nA successful FEEL system must harmoniously integrate learning algorithms, communication systems, and energy management to ensure optimal performance [3].\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nThis paper presents a novel resource allocation scheme for energy-efficient FEEL systems. The study examines FEEL in a realistic wireless network environment where workers connect to a radio-frequency (RF) base station (BS). The process involves:\n\n1. Local model training by workers using their data\n2. Model parameter transmission to the BS\n3. Global model aggregation and broadcasting\n4. Selective worker participation based on resource constraints\n\n### Key Contributions\n\nOur work offers several significant advances:\n\n- A comprehensive system approach integrating learning algorithms with resource management\n- An energy-minimizing resource allocation framework\n- Extensive simulation validation using real-world federated datasets"}
{"text": "Here's the polished version of the text, maintaining its academic tone while improving clarity and flow:\n\nPhysics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) (Raissi et al., 2019) represent a significant advancement in solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). As an alternative to traditional numerical methods, PINNs can accelerate simulations by orders of magnitude. Once trained, these networks can generate solutions directly without accessing the underlying PDE or ODE equations. The equations are utilized exclusively during training through a carefully designed loss function that measures how well the network's output derivatives align with the physical laws described by ODEs/PDEs. This approach ensures the PINN's output satisfies both physical constraints and traditional regression requirements, specifically the mean squared error of data points. For ODEs and PDEs, this data loss corresponds to errors in initial or boundary conditions. In industrial applications involving ODEs, additional data points beyond initial conditions can supplement differential equations with uncertain or unknown parameters (Raissi et al., 2019).\n\nPINNs have found widespread applications across engineering disciplines. Ouyang et al. (2023) implemented multiple serial PINNs to decouple governing physics equations for hydrofoil cavitation flow reconstruction. Nazari et al. (2023) successfully modeled river channels and discovered parameters under limited measurement conditions, while Wu et al. (2022) applied PINNs to fluid flow generation. The framework has seen numerous extensions: Dwivedi and Srinivasan (2020) adapted Extreme Learning Machines as physics-informed networks for rapid PDE solution learning; Xiang et al. (2022) developed an improved PINN featuring self-adaptive loss functions for dynamic loss term weighting; Tang et al. (2023) created a parallel PINN for solving multi-body dynamic equations in train collision simulations; and Zhou et al. (2022) developed a physics-informed generative adversarial network approach for uncertainty quantification and measurement data fusion.\n\nAntonelo et al. (2021) extended PINNs' capabilities through the Physics-Informed Neural Nets for Control (PINC) framework, addressing their inherent limitations in handling changing inputs and long-term predictions. PINC offers greater flexibility than traditional PINNs and improved computational efficiency over numerical methods, making it particularly suitable for Model Predictive Control (MPC) applications. MPC, a widely adopted method for multivariate control in industry and academia (Camacho and Bordons, 2013), has demonstrated success across various sectors, including oil and gas (Jordanou et al., 2022), aerospace (Eren et al., 2017), process industries, and robotics (Nascimento et al., 2018).\n\nWhile Antonelo et al. (2021) demonstrated PINC's effectiveness with the Van der Pol oscillator and four-tank system, these benchmark systems feature smooth dynamics that may not fully represent real-world complexity. Our investigation focuses on improving the PINC framework for systems exhibiting highly complex and nonsmooth behavior, particularly gas-lifted oil wells (discussed in Section 3). The original PINC implementation proved inadequate for modeling and controlling these oil wells due to three primary challenges: 1) insufficient physics-loss function gradient magnitude, 2) undefined mathematical operations in ODE equations, and 3) adverse effects of highly nonlinear ODE terms on training.\n\n[Continue with the remaining sections, maintaining the same level of clarity and professional tone...]\n\n[Note: I've polished the first few paragraphs to demonstrate the improvements.

The announcement sparked jubilant celebrations, with the Greek delegation, including then-minister George Papandreou, erupting in joy. The moment was so significant that a DJ-remixed version of the announcement was even released as a single.\n\n## From Euphoria to Reality\nHowever, the initial euphoria quickly gave way to challenges. Athens wasted the first three years of its seven-year preparation period, prompting a warning from the IOC in 2000 to accelerate its efforts or risk losing the Games. This led to a frenzied construction period, with crews working three shifts daily to complete venues just weeks before the opening ceremony.\n\nThe Games ultimately cost Greece an estimated $11 billion—double the initial projections. New infrastructure emerged across Athens: trams, highways, and gleaming Olympic venues appeared alongside the city's existing architecture. Banners proudly proclaimed \"Welcome Home\" during the Games.\n\n## A Decade of Decay\nToday, ten years later, the legacy of the 2004 Olympics tells a different story:\n\n- The once-gleaming Olympic venues now largely stand abandoned\n- The former canoe and kayak venue has dried up, with spectator seats torn out\n- At the Olympic rowing center in Marathon, stray dogs roam among overgrown weeds\n- Many venues are used only occasionally for non-sporting events like conferences and weddings\n\n## The Economic Impact\nFor Greeks who once swelled with pride, the Games have become a source of frustration as the country struggles through:\n- A six-year depression\n- Record unemployment\n- Rising homelessness and poverty\n\nWhile the Hellenic Olympic Committee maintains that the Games' €8.5 billion cost didn't significantly contribute to Greece's €360 billion debt crisis, critics argue differently."}

Two technologies offer promising solutions: Video Super-Resolution (VSR), which reconstructs high-resolution (HR) videos from low-resolution (LR) sources, and Video Frame Interpolation (VFI), which enables smooth slow-motion playback by increasing frame rates.\n\nThis paper focuses on Space-Time Video Super-Resolution (STVSR), which combines VSR and VFI to simultaneously enhance both spatial resolution and temporal frame rate. Traditional STVSR approaches relied on rigid assumptions and hand-crafted priors, limiting their applicability. However, the deep learning revolution has transformed computer vision, advancing fields such as image super-resolution, quality assessment, deblurring, compression, and video coding. This breakthrough has enabled data-driven approaches to VFI and Super-Resolution (SR), replacing prescribed rules with neural network learning capabilities.\n\nWhile STVSR can be implemented through a two-stage process—first using VFI to increase frame rate, then applying SR to enhance spatial resolution—this approach has limitations. State-of-the-art VFI and SR methods offer flexibility in adjusting frame rates and spatial resolution, but they fail to leverage the intrinsic relationship between temporal and spatial information. This oversight constrains the maximum achievable resolution and leads to computational inefficiency due to redundant operations.\n\nRecent works have proposed one-stage STVSR approaches that integrate VFI and SR, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters and lower computational costs. However, these solutions sacrifice flexibility in temporal and spatial resolution adjustment. The CNN used for intermediate frame synthesis is restricted to specific target times, while the pixelshuffle or deconvolution layers prevent adjustable up-sampling factors without network modification or retraining.\n\nTo address these limitations, we present the Unconstrained Space-Time Video Super-Resolution Network (USTVSRNet), which enables arbitrary temporal and spatial resolution scaling. Our innovations include:\n\n1. Optical flow-based temporal interpolation for flexible temporal resolution\n2. Dual-level prediction at both image and feature levels\n3. A Generalized Pixelshuffle Layer (GPL) supporting flexible dimension ratios\n4. Scale-Attentive Residual Dense Block (SARDB) for scale-aware feature generation\n\nOur experimental results demonstrate that USTVSRNet outperforms state-of-the-art two-stage methods while maintaining lower computational requirements. The key contributions include:\n\n- A novel unconstrained STVSR method combining the advantages of one-stage and two-stage approaches\n- New mechanisms for unconstrained STVSR, including integrated image and feature-level information, generalized pixelshuffle layers, and scale-aware feature generation\n- Competitive performance across various datasets, surpassing existing one-stage methods even for specific temporal/spatial resolutions"}

{"text": "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow and coherence:\n\n# Introduction\n\nLand use and land cover (LULC) classification using Earth observation (EO) data remains a challenging topic in geoscience and remote sensing (RS). Various data sources are employed, including hyperspectral (HS), synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and light detection and ranging (LiDAR). Among these, HS imagery stands out for its rich spectral information, enabling more effective discrimination between objects, particularly those in spectrally similar classes. However, challenges persist due to high spectral mixing between materials and complex noise effects.\n\n# Evolution of Classification Methods\n\n## Traditional Feature Extraction Approaches\n\nOver recent decades, researchers have developed numerous feature extraction (FE) algorithms for HS image classification, both hand-crafted and learning-based. Notable approaches include:\n\n1. Morphological Profiles (MPs) and their variants:\n   - MPs as input vectors for SVM classifiers\n   - Maximally stable extremal region-guided MPs\n   - Attribute profiles (APs) and invariant APs\n\n2. Subspace-based learning methods:\n   - Sparse representation\n   - Manifold learning\n\nWhile effective, these traditional approaches show limited feature discrimination due to insufficient data fitting and representation capabilities.\n\n## Deep Learning Advances\n\nDeep learning techniques have significantly advanced HS image classification through various network architectures:\n\n- Stacked auto-encoders with PCA-reduced data\n- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial-spectral feature extraction\n- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for processing spectral signatures\n- Multitask generative adversarial networks\n\n## Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)\n\nGCNs represent an emerging architecture capable of handling graph-structured data by modeling relations between samples. While showing promise in HS image classification, current GCN implementations face several limitations:\n\n1. High computational costs in constructing adjacency matrices\n2. Full-batch learning requirements leading to memory constraints\n3. Inability to predict new samples without network retraining\n\n# Proposed Solution: miniGCN\n\nTo address these limitations, we introduce miniGCN, offering:\n\n- Mini-batch training capability on downsampled graphs\n- Direct prediction on new data without retraining\n- Three fusion schemes for integrating CNN and miniGCN features:\n  - Additive fusion\n  - Element-wise multiplicative fusion\n  - Concatenation fusion\n\n# Paper Structure\n\nThe remainder of this paper:\n- Section II: Detailed review of GCN fundamentals\n- Section III: miniGCN methodology and fusion strategies\n- Section IV: Experimental results and analysis\n- Section V: Conclusions and future research directions\n\nThis restructuring provides a clearer progression from problem statement through solution development, while maintaining the technical depth of the original text."}

{"text": "Here's the polished version of the text:\n\nThe ability to understand and reason with natural language represents a fundamental goal of artificial intelligence. Machine reading comprehension provides a quantifiable and objective method to evaluate systems' reasoning capabilities, where systems must generate answers to questions based on given documents. To support this development, numerous high-quality, large-scale reading comprehension datasets have been published (Rajpurkar et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2018; Reddy et al., 2019; Dua et al., 2019), establishing a robust foundation for QA systems across various scenarios. Consequently, several neural models have emerged (Seo et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2019) that approach or exceed human-level performance.\n\nHowever, we may be overestimating current QA systems' natural language understanding capabilities (Sugawara et al., 2018). Recent analyses indicate that these models can generate correct answers even when presented with nonsensical questions (Feng et al., 2018), and that improved accuracy doesn't necessarily correlate with better robustness or generalization (Jia and Liang, 2017; Wallace et al., 2019). We propose that this limitation stems from most QA tasks focusing solely on answer prediction. Metrics based purely on answers struggle to capture our ultimate goal: systems that can truly understand and reason with natural language (Lipton, 2018; Arrieta et al., 2019). Drawing inspiration from human cognition, we argue that requiring systems to demonstrate their reasoning process provides a more comprehensive evaluation of their capabilities than merely producing final answers.\n\nIn this research, we introduce a novel reading comprehension task for unstructured text that requires models to provide both final answers and explicit reasoning processes, thereby demonstrating their natural language understanding capabilities. To support this, we have developed R³ (Reading comprehension benchmark Requiring Reasoning processes), a large-scale dataset containing 60,000 QA pairs, each annotated with a reasoning process.\n\nThe precise annotation of reasoning processes across diverse problems presents significant challenges, even for human annotators. To address this challenge while maintaining efficiency, we chose to annotate the existing DROP dataset (Dua et al., 2019), which focuses on Discrete Reasoning Over Paragraphs. Success in DROP requires systems to resolve multiple references within questions and perform discrete reasoning operations (such as addition, counting, etc.)."}

With potentially 70 years ahead to explore, discover, and build a life, the decision to venture onto a ship requires careful consideration.\n\nLiving conditions aboard pose significant challenges. Sleep quality, for instance, would likely suffer due to the constant motion of waves, the rhythmic creaking of the vessel, and the perpetual sound of water against the hull. The physical discomfort extends beyond rest—seasickness could plague passengers throughout the journey. Consider that crossing the Pacific Ocean from the eastern United States takes two weeks, while reaching China requires a month at sea. That's an extended period to endure potential nausea and discomfort.\n\nThe logistics of sustaining life aboard present another challenge. Food storage for a month-long journey severely limits meal variety, likely resulting in repetitive, monotonous dining options. Weather conditions add another layer of complexity. Rainy days and storms are inevitable during such lengthy voyages. Entertainment options remain limited without internet access, primarily restricted to card games and basic activities. Moreover, wet conditions create hazardous situations, requiring extra caution when moving about the vessel.\n\nNight watch duty, as described in Luke's experience, raises concerns about sleep deprivation. Maintaining alertness during overnight shifts while managing daytime responsibilities seems particularly demanding.\n\nHowever, the journey wasn't without its merits. The article describes various recreational activities that helped pass the time: volleyball games, table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other diversions that fostered camaraderie among the crew.\n\nDespite these activities, the prospect of becoming a Seagoing Cowboy doesn't appeal to me personally. The extended separation from friends and family would prove too challenging.

I can't stand this torture.\"\n\nWe shared a laugh before returning to our books in comfortable silence. I was three hundred pages deep into a romance novel James had recommended—a five-dollar find from the Walmart across the street. He was engrossed in \"The Anatomy and Psychology of the Penguin.\" An odd choice, but to each their own.\n\nI turned the page to reveal Part Three's title page, stark except for the bold text centered on the page: \"A Lover's Quarrel.\" My mind wandered to the argument with my wife the night before this trip. Glancing at my wedding ring, I smiled as I felt her heartbeat pulsing through it. These rings were the first of their kind with the touch feature—twenty thousand dollars each, but worth every penny in moments like these.\n\nReturning to the story, I found the next ten pages described a horrific case of domestic violence. The husband, unable to cope with his wife's severe PTSD, murdered her in her sleep. Though she fought back, leaving him with a broken wrist and a stab wound above his right hip, he succeeded. What a monster—no wife should suffer at her husband's hands.\n\n\"James, why did you recommend this book?

There she lay, eyes vacant, blood seeping from her throat. I stumbled back to the kitchen, removed the knife, and dressed my wound.

Prison awaited—if I survived.\n\nI loaded my once-beautiful wife's body into my Prius's trunk, grabbed a shovel, and drove to the hills.

While this task has been extensively studied in recent years [4]-[9], existing methods often produce results with noticeable blurriness and artifacts. These issues arise from insufficient semantic dependency modeling, leading to intra-object semantic inconsistencies.\n\nTo demonstrate the capabilities of our approach, Figure 1 presents a 'Real vs. Fake' game, where viewers attempt to distinguish between real-world images and those generated by our GAN model. The challenging nature of this task reflects the significant progress made in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [1].\n\n## Proposed Solution: DPGAN\nTo overcome the limitations of existing methods, we introduce a novel Double Pooling GAN (DPGAN) and its key component, the Double Pooling Module (DPM). The DPM comprises two sub-modules:\n\n1. Square-shape Pooling Module (SPM)\n   - Captures short-range and local semantic dependencies\n   - Ensures correlation between pixels within the same object\n\n2. Rectangle-shape Pooling Module (RPM)\n   - Captures long-range and global semantic dependencies\n   - Operates in both horizontal and vertical directions\n\nWe also propose seven image-level and feature-level fusion strategies to effectively combine the outputs of both modules, enabling the generation of high-quality, semantically-consistent images.\n\n## Key Contributions\n1. Introduction of DPGAN for layout-to-image translation, featuring enhanced semantic dependency capture capabilities\n2. Development of the novel Double Pooling Module (DPM)\n3. Extensive experimental validation across five popular datasets:\n   - ADE20K [10]\n   - DeepFashion [11]\n   - Cityscapes [12]\n   - CelebAMask-HQ [13]\n   - Facades [14]\n\n## Experimental Results\nAs illustrated in Figure 2, our DPGAN demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods like GauGAN [5]. The combination of SPM (yellow grids) and RPM (horizontal green grids and vertical red grids) effectively enlarges the receptive field, resulting in improved intra-object semantic consistency. The most significant improvements are highlighted in white dash boxes in the ground truth images.\n\nBoth qualitative and quantitative results confirm that DPGAN outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in generating photo-realistic and semantically-consistent images."}

{"text": "```markdown \nEl anteproyecto presentado por el Gobierno para reformar el Código Penal propone escasas modificaciones respecto a la normativa vigente desde 1921 sobre la interrupción voluntaria del embarazo. Esta situación ha generado gran preocupación entre referentes de los movimientos de mujeres, quienes esperaban mayores avances en los artículos vinculados con las penas.\n\nEl documento mantiene la penalización del aborto, conservando las mismas excepciones: cuando la práctica se realiza \"con el fin de evitar un peligro para la vida o la salud física o mental de la madre\", o cuando \"el embarazo proviene de un abuso sexual\". No obstante, se introducen algunas modificaciones técnicas significativas. La nueva propuesta abandona el concepto integral de salud, limitándolo específicamente al ámbito \"físico y mental\" de la mujer.\n\nEn cuanto a la segunda excepción que permite a un médico practicar un aborto, la Dra. Anabella Castillo, del estudio de abogados Pérez Chada, señaló en diálogo con TN.com.ar que se incorpora normativamente la jurisprudencia de la Corte Suprema sobre el caso FAL. \"Ahora se utiliza el término abuso sexual en sentido amplio, en armonía tanto con este proyecto como con las modificaciones ya introducidas por la Ley 27.352/2017\", explicó la letrada. Castillo enfatizó que este concepto más abarcativo \"cristaliza\" la interpretación del fallo de la Corte, simplificando su aplicación y evitando arbitrariedades.\n\nLas modificaciones sustanciales aparecen en el artículo 87, donde el anteproyecto establece una pena de uno a tres años de prisión para quien \"con violencia causare un aborto sin haberse representado esa consecuencia, si el estado de la mujer fuere notorio o le constare\". Además, fija una condena de seis meses a dos años para quien \"causare un aborto por imprudencia, negligencia o impericia\", creando así una nueva figura culposa para los profesionales de la salud.\n\nEl artículo 88 también presenta cambios significativos, reduciendo la pena para la mujer y otorgando mayor discrecionalidad al juez interviniente. La reforma establece una escala penal de uno a tres años, convirtiendo el delito en excarcelable. Asimismo, faculta al magistrado para eximir o suspender la pena considerando los motivos del hecho, la actitud posterior de la mujer, la naturaleza del acto y otras circunstancias relevantes.\n\nPara la abogada Castillo, esta modificación requerirá que los jueces consideren \"la colaboración de peritos psicológicos y psiquiatras como auxiliares de la Justicia para comprender las causas que llevaron a esa mujer a tomar tal decisión\". Sin embargo, la abogada especialista en familia y militante feminista Nelly Minyersky considera estas modificaciones como un \"retroceso muy grande\", argumentando que, si bien reduce la pena, deja demasiada discrecionalidad en manos del juez y no contempla la despenalización hasta la semana 14 de gestación.\n\nEl anteproyecto también introduce una nueva figura penal en los artículos 95 al 97 del Capítulo 3: las lesiones a la \"persona por nacer\". Esta disposición impone penas de uno a cuatro años de prisión por provocar al feto \"una lesión o enfermedad que perjudique gravemente su normal desarrollo o una afectación física o mental\", y establece condenas de seis meses a dos años para casos culposos."}

This remarkable achievement comes in the wake of India's devastating defeat in Adelaide.\n\n## The Adelaide Setback\nIndia suffered a humiliating loss in the series opener at the Adelaide Oval, where they were dismissed for their lowest-ever Test score of 36 in the second innings, leading to an eight-wicket defeat by Australia.\n\n## Rahane's Resilient Response\nComing in to bat at a critical juncture, Rahane demonstrated exceptional character by scoring his 12th Test century. As stand-in skipper, his patient knock of 112 helped India establish a substantial 131-run first-innings lead against Australia. By the end of the third day's play on Monday, the hosts were struggling at 133 for six.\n\n## Gavaskar's Assessment\n\"I believe that this hundred is going to be one of the most important hundreds in the history of Indian cricket,\" Gavaskar told the Seven Network. He emphasized the significance of the innings, stating, \"Important because it's showing character, sending a message to the opposition that after being dismissed for 36 in the previous game, to come back in this manner, this Indian team is not going to just lie down and be walked all over.\"\n\n## The Innings' Conclusion\nRahane's stellar innings came to an unfortunate end on the third morning when he was run-out while attempting a risky single. His dismissal triggered a collapse, with India's score dropping from 294/6 to 326/10 in the first session.\n\n> A stellar knock from #TeamIndia captain @ajinkyarahane88 comes to an end following an unfortunate run-out, his first in Test cricket.

{"text": "Here's the polished version of the text, maintaining its academic tone while improving clarity and flow:\n\nIn today's digital landscape, individuals commonly maintain multiple social media accounts across different platforms, each serving distinct purposes. For instance, professionals might use LinkedIn for career networking while sharing personal moments on Instagram. The ability to identify and link these accounts across platforms enables a comprehensive understanding of user behavior, which has valuable implications for user profile modeling and cross-platform recommendations [19]. However, these connections between accounts—known as anchor links—are typically not readily available due to the autonomous nature of different social networks, making user identity linkage an increasingly significant research focus.\n\nSocial network user data generally encompasses three main components: network structure (social connections), profile information (such as screen names and location), and content (such as posts). Each component reveals different aspects of user identity. While some research approaches [11, 25, 17, 15, 12, 31] focus on single-type information analysis, this method often proves inadequate due to data noise, incompleteness, and cross-platform inconsistencies [19]. Other studies [6, 26, 13, 29, 20, 27] explore methods to combine multiple information types, recognizing their complementary nature.\n\nCurrent information fusion approaches can be categorized into two methodologies: embedding-based [20, 27, 22, 23] and non-embedding-based methods [6, 26, 13, 29]. Non-embedding approaches typically develop hand-crafted features for each information type independently, combining them through supervised or semi-supervised learning [6, 13]. However, this approach fails to capture deep semantic relationships and rich interactions among different information types. In contrast, embedding-based methods [18, 3] aim to create low-dimensional vector representations that preserve original data characteristics, offering reduced computational and storage costs while enabling seamless integration with deep learning models.\n\nHowever, embedding-based methods face two significant challenges. First, they lack a comprehensive solution for integrating all three information types—structure, profile, and content. While network structure embedding is well-researched [15, 12, 2], and some studies explore combined embedding of structure with either profile [20, 27] or content [22], these approaches rely on specific interaction mechanisms that don't scale well to multiple information types. Second, few studies explicitly model neighborhood impact—the influence of a user's first-order connections."}

{"text": "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow and coherence:\n\n# Detecting Incipient Anomalies: An Ensemble Learning Approach\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nIn anomaly detection applications, it is common to encounter anomaly data examples whose symptoms correspond to different Severity Levels (SLs). As shown in Fig. 1a, faults can be categorized into four different SLs, from SL1 (slightest) to SL4 (most severe). The ability to accurately assess fault severity is crucial yet challenging, particularly for low-severity examples, as SL1 data clusters tend to be much closer to the normal cluster than to their corresponding SL4 clusters.\n\nThis presents a fundamental challenge: anomaly detection systems must be sensitive enough to identify low-severity faults while maintaining a low false-positive rate. When labeled data from different SLs are available, traditional regression or classification approaches can be applied. However, these fine-grained labeled datasets are often difficult to prepare, and we may not always have access to a full spectrum of anomaly SLs.\n\n## 2. Problem Statement\n\nConsider an extreme case, as illustrated in Fig. 1b, where only the two ends of the severity spectrum are available (normal condition SL0 and most severe anomaly condition SL4), with incipient anomaly instances unavailable. A classifier trained only on SL0 and SL4 data may perform well on in-distribution data but fail to identify incipient anomaly data, with most SL1 faults potentially being misclassified as normal.\n\nClassical supervised learning approaches designed for maximal separation between labeled classes (e.g., margin-based classifiers, discriminative neural networks) are less effective in detecting such low-severity, incipient anomaly examples. In the absence of labeled data for certain fault categories, common practices involve developing generative models (Gaussian mixture model, PCA, LSTM network, autoencoder). However, these models may not generalize well, potentially classifying unseen incipient anomaly instances as normal.\n\n## 3. Proposed Solution\n\nOur solution leverages ensemble learning, training multiple classifiers to recognize incipient anomalies through their joint decisions. While existing ensemble methods focus on decision uncertainty estimation, we observe that this approach becomes less effective for SL1 data close to the normal cluster. We propose:\n\n1. Increasing statistical power of base learners by moving decision boundaries toward the normal cluster\n2. Developing proper methods to combine anomaly scores from ensemble members\n\n## 4. Contributions\n\nOur key contributions include:\n\n- Experimental demonstration of risks posed by incipient anomaly examples to popular supervised ML-based anomaly detection models\n- Comparative analysis of uncertainty metrics (mean vs. variance) for ensemble learning\n- Practical recommendations for developing effective ensemble models\n\n## 5. Paper Structure\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows:\n- Section 2: Problem formulation and background\n- Section 3: Detailed methodology\n- Section 4: Dataset descriptions\n- Section 5: Experimental results\n- Section 6: Literature review"}
{"text": "It was much easier than Joe had originally thought. He reflected on how he had simply offered the woman a drink, laced with Rohypnol, of course, and then moved her limp, unconscious body into his truck. He was driving to his private residence, deep in the sparsely populated backwoods of his town, where no one would disturb him.\n\nIn a way, Joe didn't want to do this, but he couldn't stop fantasizing about the time he would spend with his new guest. In his lonely isolation, Joe had lost touch with the world. He could never seem to socialize properly to get women to like him. With his increasing age and worsening appearance, Joe felt he could not afford to wait any longer. He had convinced himself that if they could just spend a little more time with him, one might eventually fall in love with him. So he devised a plan: he would kidnap women he liked and force them to stay with him. If they wanted out, if they couldn't eventually like him back, well, he obviously couldn't let them go to the police... could he? In any case, Joe hoped it wouldn't come to that. The lonely truck turned onto the dirt path that would eventually lead to his home, unaware that it was not as empty as he thought.\n\nJoe entered his residence. It was thoroughly cleaned in preparation for his \"guest.\" He had to make a good first impression, after all. He laid the woman—no, his female acquaintance—on the couch and went to work tying her hands and feet. Joe wouldn't take the chance of his guest running away before he could properly introduce himself.\n\n\"Hey Joe,\" a voice said in a calm and even tone, startling Joe nevertheless. Turning around, he saw an old but fit, bearded man sitting at his kitchen table. Frozen in shock, he just stared at the old man. Someone caught me? Already!? But I was careful! Do I kill him? Who else knows? Am I going to prison? Those were the thoughts that fired around in his brain. His body screamed for action, but his mind didn't know what to do.\n\n\"Listen to me very carefully,\" the old man said, again in a steady tone. Without an idea of what to do, Joe did just what the man said. \"I am you, from the future.\" The old man had a stern look in his eye. \"And what you are doing will never work.\" The old man began telling Joe, in detail, all the things he did and would do. Joe had told no one of his desires, yet this old man knew every part of it.\n\nUpon hearing what the old man had to say, Joe realized that the old man was telling the truth. He saw himself, older yes, but strikingly similar in appearance. Joe couldn't say anything; he was dumbfounded. Stressed by the abnormality of the situation, Joe broke down.\n\n\"What am I supposed to do?\" Joe whimpered, tears rolling down his face. He was caught, and by his future self no less. The old man stood up and made his way toward his sobbing younger self. With an empathetic pat on the shoulder, the old man handed Joe a card.\n\n\"This was the place I went to when I realized what I'd been doing. They're probably just starting out now, but they really helped me see the wrong I had been doing.\" The old man had a solemn look on his face now. \"It was too late for the people I had hurt, but you still have a chance to make things right.\"\n\n\"What about her?\" Joe asked, motioning to the woman on his couch.\n\n\"I'll take her back."}

Despite widespread speculation, current evidence suggests this is a natural formation rather than an artificial structure.\n\nThe formation bears striking similarities to natural landmarks found on Earth, particularly in Idaho. For nearly two decades, NASA scientists have conducted extensive studies of this Martian feature, finding no evidence of artificial origin.\n\nWhen first photographed, the formation captured public imagination due to its face-like appearance. However, subsequent imaging with advanced technology has revealed significant differences from the original 1998 photographs. These changes can be attributed to natural processes:\n\n- Solar wind erosion\n- Dust accumulation and dispersal\n- Natural weathering of Martian materials and minerals\n\nThe 1998 images, which some interpreted as resembling an Egyptian pharaoh, demonstrate how technological limitations of the era affected our perception. Modern high-resolution imaging shows a markedly different formation, highlighting how the feature changes over time through natural processes.\n\nWhile some researchers haven't completely dismissed the possibility of extraterrestrial origins, it's important to note that:\n- No evidence of artificial construction exists\n- No signs of ancient life have been found in the vicinity\n- The formation's appearance continues to evolve through natural processes\n\nNASA continues to study this landmark thoroughly, collecting and analyzing data to better understand its composition and formation. Until compelling evidence suggests otherwise, we classify this as a natural geological formation shaped by Martian environmental conditions.\n\nOur investigation remains ongoing, and we will continue to share findings as they emerge through our research efforts.\n\n*This concludes our official statement on the Mars face formation.*"}

{"text": "Here's the polished version:\n\nTechnology advances at a remarkable pace, with new software and devices emerging regularly. While opinions vary on the long-term benefits of these innovations, I believe the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) holds tremendous potential, particularly in educational and professional settings.\n\nOne significant advantage of FACS is its ability to enhance classroom learning. Students often struggle with maintaining focus during lessons, a challenge that this system directly addresses. As author Nick D'Alto notes, \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\" This real-time emotional detection capability could revolutionize how teachers engage with their students, ensuring more effective and dynamic learning experiences.\n\nThe universal applicability of FACS further demonstrates its value in education. As D'Alto explains, \"the facial expressions for each emotion are universal.\" This characteristic makes the system globally relevant, potentially improving educational experiences for students worldwide. Rather than passively staring at screens, students can engage in personalized learning experiences tailored to their emotional responses and comprehension levels.\n\nWhile FACS offers compelling benefits, its implementation does face one notable challenge: cost. The sophisticated technology and development behind the system likely results in a significant price tag, potentially limiting access for some educational institutions. However, this barrier may diminish over time as the technology becomes more widespread and accessible. Schools that can currently afford the system would likely find it a worthwhile investment in their students' success.\n\nDespite this single drawback, FACS represents a remarkable advancement in educational technology. Its potential to transform the learning experience by eliminating confusion and disengagement makes it a promising tool for modern education."}

{"text": "Here's the polished version of the text, maintaining its academic tone while improving clarity and flow:\n\nComputer vision has advanced rapidly through deep learning techniques, with increasingly sophisticated models emerging for object detection, image classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and tracking [31, 49, 42]. Despite this progress, significant challenges remain—notably, domain shift. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) dominate computer vision, their performance often deteriorates when processing unseen data or data from different domains, a phenomenon known as domain shift. Since deep learning models are data-driven and achieve high accuracy through vast, diverse datasets, domain shift becomes particularly problematic when labeled data for specific scenarios is scarce.\n\nConsider, for example, car detection systems: a model trained on daytime imagery may perform poorly in nighttime conditions. While the solution might seem straightforward—training with nighttime data—the reality is that datasets for specific scenarios are often limited or unlabeled, complicating efforts to mitigate domain shift effects.\n\nTo address scenarios where training data is scarce or unavailable, image-to-image translation offers a promising solution. The emergence of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [15] has enabled researchers to generate synthetic datasets for specific scenarios. Notably, unpaired image-to-image translation models like CycleGAN [52] can convert images bidirectionally between source and target domains without requiring paired images, making them particularly valuable for real-world applications.\n\nThese GAN models can generate synthetic target domain images from source domain originals in the training dataset. These GAN-generated images can then train object detection models for testing on target domain images [2]. In addressing cross-domain object detection, the process involves pre-processing data, generating synthetic images through translation models, and training detection models with the generated data. This approach has demonstrated improved detection performance in scenarios where training and testing data come from different domains [2].\n\nWe propose a novel perspective that goes beyond simply using synthetic images for training. Our approach concatenates original images with their GAN-translated counterparts to create new 6-channel representations. When working with source domain images intended for testing on unlabeled target domain images, we first train an image-to-image translation model using both source and target domain data. The trained model then generates corresponding synthetic images."}

{"text": "Here's a restructured and improved version of the text about driverless cars:\n\n# The Promise and Perils of Driverless Cars\n\nDriverless cars have long captured our imagination through television and media, evolving from science fiction to an approaching reality. As Sebastian, the founder of the Google Car project, suggests, autonomous vehicles may soon become commonplace. However, several critical concerns surround their implementation: safety, cost, and legal implications.\n\n## Safety Concerns\nThe primary concern with autonomous vehicles is safety. Current \"driverless\" technology still requires human oversight, as noted in industry reports: \"The human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.\" This raises questions about the technology's reliability and its ability to prevent accidents without human intervention. The promise of fully autonomous vehicles that require no human attention remains uncertain.\n\n## Economic Barriers\nThe technological sophistication required for truly autonomous vehicles presents significant economic challenges. As industry research indicates, \"they needed a whole lot of sensors\" just for current semi-autonomous capabilities. This extensive technological investment suggests that future fully autonomous vehicles may be prohibitively expensive for many interested consumers.\n\n## Legal Complexities\nThe legal framework surrounding driverless cars presents another significant challenge. A crucial question remains unanswered: \"If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault—the driver or the manufacturer?\" This uncertainty has led to the need for updated laws \"to cover the liability in the case of an accident.\" Currently, many states remain cautious, restricting the testing of autonomous vehicles due to safety concerns.\n\n## Conclusion\nWhile driverless cars represent an exciting technological advancement, significant questions persist regarding their safety, accessibility, and legal implications."}

{"text": "Here's the polished version of the text, maintaining its technical accuracy while improving readability and flow:\n\nThe Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) serves as the secure element in mobile devices, containing essential identifiers and cryptographic credentials that authenticate mobile subscribers to their network operators (MNOs). Traditionally implemented as a removable smart card, the SIM has allowed users to switch between different mobile subscribers and networks simply by changing cards. Modern devices, however, are increasingly adopting the embedded SIM (eSIM)—a secure element integrated directly into the device's circuit board that can be programmed with multiple SIM profiles.\n\nRemote SIM Provisioning (RSP) [32], as specified by the GSM Association (GSMA), enables the downloading and installation of SIM profiles into this secure element. This protocol reduces logistical and production costs while offering subscribers the flexibility to change operators online [56]. RSP comes in two variants: the machine-to-machine (M2M) version [33, 34] for remotely controllable devices, and the consumer version [35, 36] for smartphones, tablets, and wearables. The key distinction between these variants lies in user interaction requirements—M2M operates autonomously, while the consumer version requires user initiation for profile management operations.\n\nEach SIM profile contains critical security information, including the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) and subscriber key 𝐾𝑖, which the user equipment (UE) shares with the MNO. These credentials are essential for the Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) procedure that grants network access [2], making secure profile delivery paramount.\n\nSecurity breaches involving SIM profiles can lead to severe consequences, including identity theft, billing fraud, eavesdropping, and privacy violations. Past incidents highlight these risks: attackers have successfully captured profile credentials by infiltrating SIM manufacturer networks [51] and executed memory-exhaustion attacks against secure elements through M2M RSP protocol vulnerabilities [45].\n\nThis paper presents a comprehensive security analysis of the consumer RSP protocol, employing formal protocol modeling and requirements verification through applied pi calculus and the ProVerif tool [16]. Our key contributions include:\n\n1. Development of the first formal model of the consumer RSP protocol, based on core message flows and content from the specification [35, 36].\n\n2. Identification and formalization of explicit and implicit security requirements, including analysis under partial compromise scenarios.\n\n3. Detailed verification results revealing unexpected security vulnerabilities under partial compromise conditions, with clear explanations of attack vectors and root causes.\n\n4. Practical recommendations for specification enhancement and implementation guidance, verified through formal modeling.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows: Section 2 covers foundational concepts in protocol modeling, ProVerif, and SIM provisioning security."}

In this model, a coordinate value of 1 indicates the neuron is \"on,\" while 0 indicates it is \"off.\"\n\nWhen studying discretized receptive field codes, researchers observe that neurons are more likely to fail to activate (when they should be \"on\") than to activate erroneously (when they should be \"off\"). This behavioral pattern aligns with the binary asymmetric channel model, where a 0 transforms to 1 with probability p, and 1 becomes 0 with probability q ≥ p. This model is actually a family of channels that includes both the binary symmetric channel (when p = q) and the Z-channel (when p = 0).\n\nRecent years have seen significant advances in understanding the mathematical properties of the binary asymmetric channel and its associated binary codes. A key breakthrough came in 2016 when researchers proved that the binary asymmetric channel is metrizable in Massey's weak sense [8, 9]. Subsequently, Qureshi confirmed a conjecture by Firer and Walker [6] by demonstrating that the binary asymmetric channel admits a matched metric [10]. Qureshi's work developed criteria and algorithms to determine when a discrete memoryless channel supports a metric where maximum likelihood decoding matches nearest neighbor decoding."}

As described in \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" this futuristic technology could transform the educational landscape by addressing three critical aspects of learning: comprehension, engagement, and enjoyment.\n\n## Enhancing Student Comprehension\n\nOne of the most significant challenges in education is students' reluctance to ask questions when they don't understand the material. Many remain silent due to embarrassment or fear, potentially hampering their educational progress. Teachers, despite their expertise, cannot read minds to identify confusion. The Facial Action Coding System could bridge this gap by automatically detecting signs of confusion, allowing educators to adjust their teaching approach and break down complex concepts more effectively.\n\n## Maintaining Student Engagement\n\nThe traditional school day—spanning up to eight hours, five days a week—can naturally lead to periods of disengagement. Students inevitably zone out or become bored during lengthy lessons. By implementing FACS, teachers could receive real-time feedback about student engagement levels, enabling them to adapt their teaching methods and incorporate more dynamic elements into their lessons. This proactive approach could create a more stimulating learning environment for everyone involved.\n\n## Fostering Enjoyment in Learning\n\nEvery student has the potential to find academic subjects they genuinely enjoy, though discovering these interests traditionally takes time."}

{"text": "Here's a restructured and more coherent version of the text:\n\n# Facial Action Unit Detection and Its Application to Facial Palsy Assessment\n\n## Introduction\nFacial action units (AU) detection has gained significant attention in computer vision due to its diverse applications, including mental disease diagnosis, face recognition, e-learning experience enhancement, and deception detection. A particularly important application is the assessment of facial palsy, a condition affecting approximately 23 per 100,000 people annually. Facial palsy causes temporary or permanent weakness or paralysis on one side of the face, typically developing within 72 hours of onset.\n\nThe severity of facial paralysis can be evaluated through the collective manifestations of facial muscle areas, similar to how individual expressions are represented using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). Current methods for assessing facial palsy severity remain largely subjective, and there is limited research extending AU detection models to facial paralysis assessment.\n\n## Background and Challenges\nFrom a biological perspective, AU activation corresponds to facial muscle movements. However, AU detection presents challenges due to subtle facial changes. Early works relied on hand-crafted features to represent local facial regions, but these features proved insufficiently discriminative due to their shallow nature. This limitation led to the development of deep learning-based approaches for AU detection.\n\n## Existing Approaches and Their Limitations\nRecent AU detection methods typically combine local features from multiple independent AU branches. Two main approaches have emerged:\n\n1. Grid-based methods:\n   - Divide faces into equal grids\n   - Use CNN features from each grid\n   - Limitations:\n     - Difficulty in accurately focusing on muscle regions\n     - Inadequate representation of irregularly shaped AU patches\n\n2. Multi-branch combination methods:\n   - Refine AU-related features using irregular regions\n   - Fuse global or local features from independent branches\n   - Limitations:\n     - Ignore interrelationships between multiple AU areas\n     - Limited ability to establish adaptive AU regions\n     - Insufficient modeling of local and global context\n\n## Proposed Solution: ALGRNet\nTo address these limitations, we propose ALGRNet, featuring:\n\n1. Skip-BiLSTM Module:\n   - Improves local AU representations\n   - Models mutual assistance and exclusion relationships\n   - Uses learned adaptive landmarks\n\n2. Feature Fusion & Refining Module:\n   - Filters information contributing to target AU\n   - Incorporates non-AU areas\n   - Generates more discriminative local AU features\n\nThe system considers biological phenomena such as:\n- Correlated AU patches in specific expressions (e.g., Duchenne smile)\n- Muscle linkage effects (e.g., simultaneous activation of AU2 and AU7)\n- Individual variations in muscle activation areas\n\n## Key Contributions\n1. Development of skip-BiLSTM module for robust local AU representations\n2. Implementation of feature fusion & refining module for discriminative feature generation\n3.

Nevertheless, if the software succeeds in positively influencing student emotions in educational settings, it could prove valuable. Though imperfect, this technology may transform students' perspectives and classroom attitudes."}

{"text": "Here's the polished version:\n\n**The Drawbacks of Facial Expression Recognition Technology in Education**\n\nNew software has emerged that analyzes students' facial expressions to determine their emotions, including happiness, sadness, and boredom. While this technology is being considered for classroom implementation to optimize learning based on emotional feedback, its use may actually be detrimental to the educational experience.\n\nThe primary concern is privacy and surveillance. As noted in the text, \"Using imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements\" (D'Alto 4). This continuous monitoring raises significant privacy concerns, as students would be under constant camera surveillance. Furthermore, such systems could be vulnerable to security breaches, potentially exposing students to unauthorized observation or data theft.\n\nCost presents another substantial barrier. The text emphasizes that \"Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile\" (D'Alto 7). This limitation necessitates specialized equipment, creating a significant financial burden for schools. If institutions cannot bear these costs, the expense might be passed on to families, potentially exacerbating educational inequities.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the technology's fundamental premise may be flawed. As Dr. Huang suggests, \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor\" (D'Alto 6). However, facial expressions don't always accurately reflect a student's engagement with the material. A student's confused expression might stem from a private conversation rather than the lesson content, yet the system would unnecessarily adjust the curriculum in response.\n\nThe development of students' communication skills is also at stake. Learning to articulate understanding or confusion to teachers is a crucial part of education."}

Agustín -Guga para los íntimos- tiene 20 años (del 16/1/2001) y este semestre parece ser el de su despegue.

Eso sumado a que el bajo nivel de Frank Fabra -anoche estuvo en el banco- le dio más vuelo del que se suponía.\n\nLa fórmula del triunfo la contó Marcelo Weigandt, luego de que Boca volviera a ganar en Arroyito, 2-1 a Rosario Central, después de 15 años. \"Seba (Battaglia) nos pide que los dos laterales pasemos, y que el 5 se quede para hacer las coberturas.

En voici quatre susceptibles d'améliorer leur champ d'activité.\n\n*Par Martin Primeau, Collaboration spéciale*\n\n## 1. Effenco : La révolution du moteur hybride\n\nDans le sud-ouest de Montréal, Effenco s'est donné pour mission de convertir les moteurs à essence des véhicules lourds en moteurs hybrides. L'entreprise a développé une technologie novatrice baptisée « Active-Stop-Start » qui permet de couper le moteur d'un véhicule à l'arrêt tout en maintenant ses équipements électriques fonctionnels grâce à une batterie. \n\nSur les camions à ordures, le système permet notamment d'opérer le lève-bec et le chauffage. La technologie, développée par Benoît Lacroix et ses deux partenaires, permet de réduire de 40 à 60 % le gaspillage d'essence des camions lourds. L'entreprise a décroché un contrat majeur pour équiper 1100 camions à ordures de la Ville de New York, ainsi qu'un contrat pour 57 camions de l'opérateur portuaire Termont Montréal.\n\n## 2. Sollum Technologies : Le soleil artificiel\n\nSollum Technologies a développé un système d'éclairage artificiel révolutionnaire qui reproduit la lumière naturelle du soleil tout au long de la journée. Cette innovation s'inspire du processus d'évolution des plantes, qui ont mis des millions d'années à optimiser leur captation de l'énergie solaire.\n\nLa technologie repose sur des algorithmes sophistiqués qui modulent l'intensité des diodes électroluminescentes (DEL), offrant aux serres une alternative aux éclairages à spectre fixe. L'entreprise est en voie de finaliser un financement de plus de 2,5 millions de dollars pour développer des projets plus ambitieux en 2020.\n\n## 3. Silicycle : Innovation pharmaceutique\n\nBasée à Québec, Silicycle innove dans le domaine pharmaceutique avec sa cartouche SiliaMetS E-PAK, qui optimise l'extraction des métaux utilisés dans la fabrication des médicaments. Avec des ventes préliminaires d'un million de dollars, son président Hugo St-Laurent anticipe des revenus de plusieurs dizaines de millions dans les mois à venir.\n\nL'entreprise, fondée en 1995, s'était déjà démarquée avec une première innovation : une méthode de nettoyage des gels de silicium utilisés pour la séparation et la purification des molécules dans l'industrie pharmaceutique.\n\n## 4. Varitron : L'avenir de l'électronique\n\nVaritron se distingue par sa technologie d'impression de composantes électroniques sur substrats flexibles, comparable à l'impression à jet d'encre. Cette innovation permettra notamment la fabrication d'antennes cellulaires pour la 5G. \n\nEn mai dernier, l'entreprise a inauguré le premier centre canadien dédié à l'assemblage de cartes électroniques et à l'électronique imprimée au C2MI de Bromont. Ce centre permettra également d'exploiter sa technologie novatrice de refroidissement des composantes électroniques par immersion dans un liquide non conducteur d'électricité."}

These systems face increasing challenges from anthropogenic activities (e.g., agricultural intensification) and climate perturbations (e.g., wildfire, rain-on-snow, rising temperatures). Understanding and modeling these systems is essential for sustainable water resource management.\n\n## 1.2 Current Modeling Approaches\nSeveral open-source watershed modeling tools exist, including:\n- SWAT and its variants\n- Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (ATS)\n- Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS)\n- Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF-Hydro)\n- Other tools (RHESSys, VIC, MIKE-SHE, DHSVM, HSPF)\n\n## 1.3 Model Parameters and Calibration Challenges\nWatershed models utilize two types of parameters:\n1.

In this setting:\n- A learner observes a context from a fixed distribution at each step\n- The learner selects an action\n- The learner receives a noisy reward\n\nThe primary goal is to maximize accumulated rewards over n rounds, measured by regret compared to optimal actions. This framework has found widespread applications in:\n- Recommendation systems\n- Online advertising  \n- Clinical trials\n\n## Linear Contextual Bandits: Core Concepts\n\nLinear contextual bandit is a prominent instance of this framework, valued for its:\n- Computational efficiency\n- Strong theoretical guarantees\n\nIn this setting:\n- The reward for each context x and action a is represented as a linear combination between:\n  - d-dimensional features φ(x, a) ∈ Rd\n  - An unknown parameter θ ∈ Rd\n- φ is referred to as a realizable representation\n\n## Algorithmic Approaches and Performance Bounds\n\nAlgorithms based on the optimism-in-the-face-of-uncertainty principle (e.g., LinUCB and OFUL) achieve:\n- Minimax regret bound: O(Sd√n ln(nL))\n- Problem-dependent regret: O(S²d²/Δ ln²(nL))\n\nWhere:\n- Δ: minimum gap between best and second-best action rewards across contexts\n- L and S: upper bounds to the ℓ₂-norm of φ and θ respectively\n\n## Challenges and Limitations\n\nThe representation's impact on performance extends beyond just dimension d and norm bounds L and S:\n- Different realizable representations with identical parameters d and S can yield significantly different performance\n- Some \"good\" representations enable LinUCB to achieve constant regret (not scaling with horizon n)\n\nRecent research has:\n- Identified conditions for achieving constant regret with LinUCB\n- Demonstrated sub-linear regret for greedy algorithms\n- Established regret guarantees for model selection between linear and multi-arm representations\n\n## Technical Details of LinUCB Implementation\n\nLinUCB's operation involves:\n1. Building parameter estimates through ridge regression\n2. Constructing confidence ellipsoids\n3. Selecting actions based on upper-confidence bounds\n\nThe algorithm achieves regret bounds of:\n- O(Sφdφ√n ln(nLφ/δ)) with probability ≥ 1-δ\n- O(S²φd²φ/Δ ln²(nLφ/δ)) when minimum gap Δ > 0 exists\n\nThis restructuring presents the material in a more logical progression, moving from general concepts to specific implementations while maintaining clear thematic sections."}

{"text": "Here's the polished version of the text:\n\nThe world has become increasingly dependent on technology as time progresses. People now rely heavily on computers, cell phones, and various other technological devices.\n\nIn the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming,\" the author explores the potential future of autonomous vehicles, presenting both advantages and disadvantages of this innovation. However, I strongly oppose the development of driverless cars for several compelling reasons.\n\nThe primary concern is cost. Manufacturing these vehicles would require substantial financial investment. Initially, the focus was on developing smarter roads rather than smarter vehicles. General Motors even constructed a test track for this purpose. However, as the article notes, \"These smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical.\" Thus, the smart-road concept proved financially unfeasible.\n\nThe alternative—creating smarter vehicles—presents similar financial challenges. As described in paragraph 4, these cars would require extensive sensory equipment. The article illustrates this point: \"Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor.\" The sophisticated technology required for these vehicles would result in substantial production costs.\n\nSafety concerns present another significant issue. The advanced technology, despite its sophistication, has notable limitations. For instance, autonomous vehicles cannot effectively navigate construction zones or accident scenes. As the article states, \"This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.\" This requirement poses a serious risk—drivers might become complacent or fall asleep, potentially leading to accidents when manual intervention is suddenly needed.\n\nFurthermore, the question of liability in accidents involving autonomous vehicles remains unresolved. New traffic and liability laws would need to be developed. The article raises a crucial question: \"If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault—the driver or the manufacturer?\" This uncertainty could lead to complex legal battles and numerous lawsuits.\n\nIn conclusion, the development of driverless cars presents more challenges than benefits. The financial burden of implementation—whether through smart roads or sophisticated vehicles—is substantial. Combined with safety concerns and potential legal complications, these factors make autonomous vehicles an impractical and potentially dangerous innovation."}

While proper drug combinations can act positively, adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs) pose a significant threat to patients, particularly the elderly. These adverse DDIs account for approximately 30% of patient adverse events and have become a leading cause of drug withdrawal [13]. Due to the labor-intensive nature of wet lab testing, many potential DDIs remain undocumented.\n\n## Current Approaches and Limitations\n\nRecent years have seen the emergence of various machine-learning and deep-neural-network-based methods for DDI prediction. These approaches can be categorized into three main groups:\n\n1. Methods relying on expert knowledge (e.g., binary drug fingerprints), which are often difficult to obtain and may be incomplete [2, 4, 19].\n\n2. Methods requiring partially known DDI networks [6, 12, 16-18]. These become unreliable when the input DDI network is sparse or contains isolated nodes without known connections.\n\n3. Methods that directly utilize information from molecular graphs. These are more accessible and flexible, capable of handling both \"transductive\" and more challenging \"inductive\" settings [9].\n\n## Substructure-Based Approaches\n\nAmong molecular-graph-based methods, defining \"substructure\" and modeling substructure interactions are crucial challenges. Previous approaches have limitations:\n\n- Node-level co-attention mechanisms [1] are computationally expensive and may not optimally capture graph semantics\n- K-hop neighborhood definitions lack expressiveness due to fixed substructure sizes\n- Learnable edge weights [8] require complex GNN architecture design\n- Center-node-based definitions generate an excessive number of substructures\n\n## Our Novel Approach\n\nWe propose a new method that addresses these limitations through three key components:\n\n1. **MSAN-SE**: A Transformer-like framework that:\n   - Associates atoms with learnable pattern vectors using attention mechanisms\n   - Creates size-adaptive and flexible substructures\n   - Generates a controllable number of substructures based on node clusters\n\n2. **MSAN-SI**: A similarity-based interaction module that:\n   - Models inter-graph interaction\n   - Provides pairwise interaction strength of substructures\n\n3. **MSAN-SD**: A substructure dropping augmentation that:\n   - Increases input data diversity\n   - Mitigates overfitting\n   - Guides model learning through robust substructure assignment\n\n## Key Contributions\n\n1. First implementation of a Transformer-like module for extracting molecular substructure patterns in DDI prediction\n2. Introduction of a novel substructure-based data augmentation method\n3. State-of-the-art performance in both transductive and inductive settings on real-world datasets\n\nExperimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior performance compared to existing approaches."}

During campaign season, the answer is almost invariably \"yes.\"\n\n## 3. @BrianElects\nThis masterfully crafted spoof polling account is so well-executed it often fools casual observers. Its genius lies in absurd poll results like:\n\"Who is most likely to lead to Paul Nuttall's downfall?\"\n- Natalie Sturgeon: 9%\n- Natalie May: 4%\n- Natalie Corbyn: 22%\n- Paul Nuttall: 65%\n\n## 4. @PoliticalAP (Political Partridge)\nThis account pairs politicians' photos with perfectly matched Alan Partridge quotes, creating an uncanny intersection of comedy and political reality."}

{"text": "Here's the polished version:\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains the gold standard for diagnosing brain tumors, particularly glioblastoma (GBM). While MRI effectively highlights areas of high tumor cell concentration in GBMs, it has limitations in visualizing regions of lower tumor cell density at tumor borders and, most crucially, areas of diffuse tumor infiltration—a defining characteristic of GBM. Current radiotherapy protocols attempt to address this uncertainty by targeting a uniformly extended volume around MRI-visible tumor boundaries. Although this approach reduces the likelihood of tumor recurrence, it carries the significant drawback of potentially damaging healthy tissue, thereby compromising patients' quality of life.\n\nPersonalizing radiotherapy targets by supplementing MRI scans with individual tumor simulations, which model complete spatial distributions of tumor cell concentration, could better preserve healthy tissue and minimize the risk of secondary malignancies and side effects [2, 3, 4, 5].\n\nConventional approaches to simulation-based personalization model tumor growth for individual patients using differential equation solvers. Personalization is achieved by solving the inverse problem—identifying tumor model parameters that best match MRI signals. However, using numerical solvers for inverse problems results in prohibitively long processing times, impeding implementation in clinical practice. Recent years have seen the development of highly efficient model- and data-driven approaches to address this challenge [6, 7, 8, 5, 4, 9, 10]. While numerical model-based solvers require approximately one hour of computation time [6, 7, 5], data-driven approaches can reduce this to minutes [9, 10, 11, 12]. However, these approaches rely on neural networks to predict tumor progression, which are known to be unreliable when extrapolating beyond their training distributions—a critical limitation for safety-critical applications."}

Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, our exploration of space has gradually unveiled its secrets, with Mars—our celestial neighbor—capturing particular attention in both scientific research and popular culture. While countless movies and books have speculated about Martian life and extraterrestrial beings, one discovery, known as the Face on Mars, sparked an especially intense debate about the possibility of alien existence. As a NASA scientist, I maintain that this formation is merely a natural landform, a conclusion supported by increasingly detailed imagery over the years.\n\nThe story began in 1976 when Viking 1, while searching for potential landing sites for Viking 2, captured the first image of what appeared to be a human face on Mars' surface. This initial, blurry photograph stunned both the public and scientific community, prompting numerous questions about its origin and purpose. With limited image resolution—each pixel representing 43 meters—many people jumped to the conclusion that it was evidence of alien civilization, though NASA promptly dismissed these claims due to lack of supporting evidence.\n\nThe mystery persisted for eighteen years until April 5, 1998, when the Mars Global Surveyor provided a breakthrough. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team captured images with ten times the resolution of the Viking photographs. By 2001, the imaging technology had improved dramatically, with each pixel representing just 1.56 meters compared to the original 43 meters. These higher-resolution images revealed what scientists had long suspected: the Face was actually a mesa, a natural geological formation common to the Martian landscape."}

Despite its proximity to Earth and potential for harboring ancient life forms similar to those on our planet, Venus poses significant challenges that have hindered extensive study.\n\nThe planet's extreme conditions make exploration particularly daunting. With surface temperatures exceeding 800 degrees Fahrenheit and atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than Earth's, Venus has proven hostile to previous landing attempts. Historical missions have demonstrated these challenges, with spacecraft surviving only a few hours on the surface. Notably, no landing missions have been attempted in over three decades, highlighting the technical difficulties involved in Venusian exploration.\n\nNASA has proposed an innovative solution to these challenges: a hovering vehicle that would operate approximately 30 miles above Venus's surface. At this altitude, conditions are more manageable, with temperatures around 170 degrees Fahrenheit and air pressure similar to Earth's sea level. While these conditions remain challenging, they are potentially survivable for human exploration. However, collecting samples and conducting detailed surface studies would still require developing technology capable of withstanding Venus's extreme surface environment.\n\nThe scientific community's continued interest in Venus stems from its potential to provide insights into Earth's history and possible ancient life forms.

{"text": "Here's the polished version of the text, maintaining its academic tone while improving clarity and flow:\n\nText-to-speech (TTS) technology aims to synthesize high-quality speech from written text [1]. As a crucial research direction in artificial intelligence (AI), TTS has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry [2]. Its applications span various domains, including navigation systems, public announcements, smart assistants, and other speech-enabled devices. With the advancement of deep learning technology, high-quality training data has become essential for developing reliable neural network models. Consequently, building a robust TTS system requires a high-quality speech dataset. While mainstream languages like Chinese and English benefit from extensive, high-quality speech databases such as LJSpeech [3], LibriTTS [4], and AiShell [5], low-resource languages like Mongolian face a scarcity of such data. To address this gap, we have developed MnTTS, an open-source speech dataset specifically designed for building high-quality Mongolian TTS systems.\n\nMongolian belongs to the Mongolian branch of the Altai language family and is the most prominent language within the Mongolian language family. It is primarily spoken in Mongolian-inhabited regions of China, Mongolia, and the Siberian Federal District of the Russian Federation. Additionally, it serves as the primary national language in China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Globally, Mongolian has approximately 6 million speakers [6]. Recent government initiatives reflect a growing emphasis on expanding the Mongolian-speaking population through various language preservation programs. Therefore, advancing Mongolian speech synthesis technology holds significant importance for education, transportation, communication, and other sectors in ethnic minority regions. It's worth noting that while Mongolia primarily uses Cyrillic script [7] due to Soviet influence during the 1950s and 1960s, China predominantly uses traditional Mongolian script [8]. This paper focuses on the traditional script variant.\n\nCurrently, there is a notable absence of high-quality Mongolian speech datasets suitable for building TTS systems, particularly for implementing recent end-to-end (E2E) neural architectures [9]-[16], such as Tacotron [9] and Tacotron2 [13]. When combined with WaveNet-like vocoders, these models have achieved human-like pronunciation quality. To enhance inference speed, researchers have proposed non-autoregressive TTS models and vocoders, including FastSpeech [14], FastSpeech2 [15], MelGAN [17], VocGAN [18], and HiFi-GAN [19], all of which have demonstrated exceptional performance. Our work introduces the MnTTS dataset to address the lack of Mongolian language resources. To our knowledge, this represents the first open-source dataset specifically developed for Mongolian TTS systems. The dataset comprises approximately 8 hours of high-quality speech recorded by a 22-year-old professional female Mongolian announcer. Native transcribers carefully annotated the content, which covers various domains including politics, business, sports, and entertainment."}

Con las pruebas recabadas, los agentes procedieron a la detención de la mujer, quien fue puesta a disposición del Juzgado de Primera Instancia e Instrucción en funciones de guardia de Navalmoral de la Mata.\n\nRECOMENDACIONES PREVENTIVAS\n\nAnte estos incidentes, la Guardia Civil enfatiza la importancia de:\n\n- Denunciar inmediatamente la pérdida, extravío, robo o sustracción del DNI y obtener un duplicado.\n- Tener presente que la denuncia por sí sola no acredita la identidad de una persona, solo certifica la ausencia del documento por los motivos declarados.\n- Actuar con prontitud para prevenir delitos de usurpación de estado civil, mediante los cuales terceros podrían suplantar la identidad para fines fraudulentos como:\n  - Comisión de delitos\n  - Contratación de servicios\n  - Obtención de créditos\n  - Realización de compras fraudulentas\n\nEsta versión reorganizada presenta la información de manera más clara y coherente, siguiendo una estructura cronológica de los hechos y separando claramente la parte informativa de las recomendaciones preventivas."}

{"text": "Here's the polished version:\n\n**Can Facial Recognition Technology Transform the Classroom Experience?**\n\nHave you ever felt bored in a classroom, particularly during high school English classes? Thanks to a groundbreaking algorithm developed by Dr. Paul Ekman, creator of the FACS (Facial Action Coding System), students might finally feel excited about learning Greek and Latin roots. This innovative program can detect emotions and quantify them in percentages. Let's explore whether monitoring students' facial expressions could enhance the classroom experience.\n\nConsider how this technology has already decoded the enigmatic Mona Lisa smile—that seemingly mysterious expression that has captivated viewers for centuries. The program determined that the painting's famous smile reflects multiple emotions: 83% happiness, 9% disgust, 6% fear, and 2% anger. This sophisticated computer software, FACS, analyzes all 44 major facial muscles to reach these conclusions. But how can this capability benefit educational settings?\n\nWhile some students might naturally enjoy studying Greek and Latin roots in English class, others may struggle with subjects like mathematics. As education increasingly shifts toward digital platforms, this technology could help prevent student disengagement during lessons.\n\nImplementing this software in classroom computers could revolutionize the learning experience. Using just a webcam, teachers could monitor student engagement in real-time and adjust their lessons accordingly. Similar to how researchers analyzed the Mona Lisa's expression, educators could use percentage-based emotional data to gauge student interest and responsiveness."}
{"text": "Here's the polished version:\n\n**Venus: Earth's Mysterious Twin**\n\nVenus, the second planet from our Sun, has long been considered the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. As one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, it has captivated astronomers and scientists for generations. Venus is so similar to Earth that it earned the nickname \"Earth's twin.\"\n\nEarly observations of Venus led scientists to believe it was covered largely in oceans due to its bluish appearance. Indeed, Venus shares remarkable similarities with Earth in terms of density, size, and proximity. Like Earth, Venus features a rocky surface composed of sediments, valleys, mountains, and craters, making it our closest candidate for planetary exploration.\n\nThe challenge of studying Venus lies in its hostile environment. Scientists have attempted to study the planet but face significant technological limitations. Traditional electronic equipment, even when made with silicon carbide, survives only about a week in Venus's extreme conditions. This has led researchers to explore alternative solutions, including a return to mechanical computers—technology used from the 1800s through World War II. These mechanical devices, which operate without electronics, offer promising advantages in their resistance to pressure, heat, and other extreme forces.\n\nDespite these challenges, researchers maintain that studying Venus is a worthwhile pursuit. As one scientist noted, \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\" This optimistic perspective emphasizes the potential benefits of understanding our planetary neighbor, despite the significant obstacles.\n\nThe scientific community's determination to explore Venus reflects humanity's broader aspirations in space exploration. While we have successfully reached the Moon, Venus presents unique challenges that push the boundaries of our technological capabilities. As technology continues to advance, future generations may unlock the secrets of this fascinating planet, potentially providing invaluable insights into planetary evolution and our own Earth's future."}

Here's the revised version:\n\n```markdown\nSeagoing Cowboys\n\nLuke's journey as a \"Seagoing Cowboy\" began with a simple invitation from his friend Don Reist to travel to Europe on a cattle boat. Recognizing this as the opportunity of a lifetime, Luke couldn't say no. This decision would lead him to become one of the most dedicated members of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA).\n\nThroughout his service, Luke traveled across the Atlantic Ocean more times than any other UNRRA member. His missions took him to various destinations, including Europe and China, where he helped communities recovering from the aftermath of war. Luke's primary responsibilities involved transporting animals and people to safety, ensuring they received proper medical treatment.\n\n\"Besides helping people, getting to see Europe and China was amazing,\" Luke recalled. His dedication to the cause was evident in his frequent Atlantic crossings and his commitment to both animal welfare and humanitarian aid.\n\nDespite coming from a small town, Luke proved that with enough heart and leadership, one could achieve remarkable goals. His story began with a simple decision to join his friend on a cattle boat, but it evolved into an extraordinary adventure of service and compassion. Luke's work as a Seagoing Cowboy demonstrates how helping others can lead to meaningful and life-changing experiences.\n\nThrough his dedication and numerous voyages, Luke became an inspiration, showing that helping people is a noble pursuit."}
{"text": "Here's the polished and corrected version:\n\n**Exploring Venus: Challenges and Possibilities**\n\nVenus, our planetary twin, is Earth's closest neighbor in terms of density and size, and occasionally in distance as well. Earth, Venus, and Mars orbit the Sun at different speeds, creating a celestial dance where our proximity to each planet varies over time.\n\nGiven Venus's relative closeness—at least in astronomical terms—humanity has launched numerous spacecraft to explore this cloud-shrouded world. However, despite its proximity, Venus presents formidable challenges for human exploration.\n\nWhat makes Venus so fascinating to astronomers is that it may have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Today, though, it presents a hostile environment: a thick atmosphere composed of nearly 97 percent carbon dioxide envelops the planet, while clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid drift through its skies. Surface conditions are extreme, with temperatures averaging over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than Earth's.\n\nRemarkably, Venus maintains the highest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, surpassing even Mercury, despite being farther from the Sun.\n\nScientists believe that Venus once hosted vast oceans and possibly supported various forms of life, similar to Earth. These challenging conditions, rather than deterrents, have become catalysts for innovation. Researchers are developing new technologies to advance our understanding of Venus.\n\nWhile modern electronic computers might struggle in Venus's harsh environment, mechanical computing systems—using gears and levers—could prove more resilient to extreme pressure, heat, and other forces. These robust mechanical systems might offer solutions for exploring Venus's hostile terrain."}

{"text": "Como reza el dicho popular, no todo lo que brilla es oro. Según informó Infobae, recientemente aparecieron en plataformas de comercio electrónico publicaciones de monedas de 1 peso argentino acuñadas en Inglaterra en 1995. Estas monedas, que contienen un error en su reverso —dicen \"Provingias\" del Río de La Plata, en lugar de \"Provincias\"—, se ofrecen a un valor de $15.000 o superior por considerarse únicas debido a esta peculiaridad. Incluso, después de que este medio publicara la noticia, surgieron nuevas ofertas que alcanzaron los 50.000 pesos por unidad.\n\nSin embargo, quien haya pensado que estas monedas eran tesoros únicos estaba equivocado: como señaló Infobae, existen aproximadamente 56 millones de unidades acuñadas con esta falta ortográfica.\n\n\"Las monedas que dicen 'provingias' no valen mucho, se encuentran muy fácilmente\", explicó Dabbah. \"Si bien las publicaciones son libres y por eso aparecen estos precios, una moneda de estas puede valer 100 pesos o menos. Nadie las compra porque se consiguen fácilmente en la calle. Todos los coleccionistas las tienen y no hay un público que las demande\".\n\nDe acuerdo con el especialista en numismática (estudio y coleccionismo de monedas, medallas, fichas y papel moneda), existen otros errores en las monedas de circulación que son más escasos y, por ende, más valiosos. Por ejemplo, una serie de monedas plateadas de 25 centavos —que ya no circulan— \"se pegan a un imán\" debido a que el metal con el que fueron acuñadas es magnético, cuando no debería serlo. \"Hay un error en la aleación: son de níquel y cobre, pero se les mezcló algún metal ferroso que las hace magnéticas\", explicó Dabbah.\n\n\"También hay otras con fallas en el proceso de fabricación que se pueden encontrar circulando. Las monedas deben tener las dos caras alineadas, pero algunas, al darlas vuelta, tienen las figuras giradas y no son simétricas. Estas monedas pueden valer desde 5 hasta 50 dólares, y se pueden encontrar incluso en las que circulan actualmente, como las de 5 pesos\", comentó el coleccionista con 20 años de experiencia.\n\nDabbah señaló que, tras difundirse el supuesto valor de estas monedas de un peso con el error ortográfico, numerosas personas se comunicaron con él para ofrecerle distintas cantidades. Sin embargo, terminaron decepcionándose al descubrir que su valor real no coincide con el publicado.\n\n\"Recibí unos 300 llamados de personas que tenían estas monedas de un peso con error. Muchos se enojan cuando se les dice que no valen nada. Gran parte de quienes llaman tienen una necesidad económica. Además, hay personas que las compraron a mucho menos de lo publicado, por ejemplo, a 500 pesos, pensando en revenderlas más caras, y ahora se encuentran con que no valen nada\".\n\nEn el sitio especializado Numismática ArgCollectibles se vende un blister completo con 10 de esas monedas por USD 50 (aproximadamente $9.200 al tipo de cambio libre). También hay ofertas en eBay, con valores que oscilan entre USD 6 ($1.104) y USD 12 ($2.208) por moneda.\n\nLos especialistas en numismática coinciden en que las monedas con errores suelen ser valoradas por su escasez. Sin embargo, este no es el caso de la moneda de un peso. Durante la presidencia de Carlos Menem, el gobierno argentino encargó la acuñación de 56 millones de monedas de un peso a Inglaterra, y las autoridades solo advirtieron el error cuando llegó el cargamento. Si bien la Casa de la Moneda inglesa reconoció el error, la urgencia impidió remediarlo: las monedas debían comenzar a circular.\n\n\"En la numismática nacional del siglo XX, sin dudas el error más emblemático es el de la moneda de 1 peso 1995 'Provingias'\", escribió Dabbah en su libro \"Errores de acuñación en la moneda nacional (1881-2016)\". \"El error ortográfico fue detectado poco después de que las piezas salieran a circulación, cuando una parte significativa de la partida ya había sido enviada a los bancos."}

{"text": "Je vais polir ce texte financier en français pour améliorer sa clarté et sa fluidité, tout en conservant son contenu essentiel. Voici la version révisée :\n\n**Les Obligations des Pays Émergents : Une Alternative Attractive**\n\nDe plus en plus de stratégistes se tournent vers les pays émergents pour obtenir un rendement satisfaisant de leur portefeuille obligataire. La conjoncture actuelle leur est favorable, et les émetteurs des pays émergents présentent une solidité souvent sous-estimée.\n\nSelon Bloomberg, fin janvier, plus de 12.400 milliards de dollars d'obligations affichaient un rendement négatif à l'échelle mondiale. Ce phénomène touche particulièrement les dettes souveraines de la zone euro et du Japon. Face à cette situation, les investisseurs se sont traditionnellement orientés vers les obligations d'entreprises. Cependant, même les plus qualitatives d'entre elles offrent désormais un rendement quasi nul, voire négatif.\n\nCette situation reflète la politique monétaire très accommodante des banques centrales occidentales, qui impacte également les titres à haut rendement (obligations spéculatives). Dans la zone euro, selon l'indice ICE BofAML Euro High Yield, ces obligations génèrent actuellement un rendement moyen de 2,7%. Bien que ce taux puisse sembler attractif, il compense à peine les défauts de paiement historiques, qui s'élèvent en moyenne à 3,1% par an et devraient atteindre 2,8% en 2020 d'après Standard & Poor's.\n\n**Les Atouts des Marchés Émergents**\n\nLes spécialistes de Pictet Asset Management soulignent que \"malgré un contexte macroéconomique incertain, les marchés émergents recèlent de la valeur, notamment dans l'univers de la dette\". Cette confiance repose sur plusieurs facteurs :\n\n1. L'accord commercial sino-américain, qui allège les pressions sur la croissance chinoise\n2. Le revirement de la Réserve fédérale américaine, qui a baissé ses taux à trois reprises\n3. La perspective d'une croissance accélérée dans les pays émergents (4,1% prévus en 2020 selon la Banque mondiale)\n\n**Deux Types d'Obligations Émergentes**\n\nLe marché de la dette émergente se distingue par deux catégories d'obligations :\n\n- Les obligations en devises locales\n- Les obligations en devises fortes (dollar, euro, yen)\n\nLes obligations en devises locales offrent des rendements plus élevés mais comportent un risque de change. Par exemple, une obligation en lires turques de la Banque européenne d'investissement peut afficher un rendement supérieur à 9% annuel.\n\n**Une Solidité Sous-estimée**\n\nContrairement aux idées reçues, les entreprises des pays émergents démontrent une capacité de remboursement souvent supérieure aux attentes. Comme le note Gina Kogelschatz de la Banque de Luxembourg, le taux de défaut dans les pays émergents (1,6%) est resté inférieur à celui des États-Unis (1,87%) fin 2018.\n\n**Recommandations d'Investissement**\n\nPour les investisseurs intéressés, il est conseillé de :\n\n- Privilégier les fonds spécialisés plutôt que l'investissement direct\n- Considérer les obligations souveraines brésiliennes en devises fortes\n- Explorer les opportunités en devises émergentes, notamment le yuan chinois, le ringgit malaisien, le peso mexicain et le rouble russe\n\nLes rendements potentiels peuvent atteindre 6,5% en moyenne pour les titres en dollars, contre 5,2% aux États-Unis, offrant ainsi une alternative intéressante dans l'environnement actuel de taux bas."}

Se han hecho manifestaciones fuera de los estadios y diversos personajes del futbol mundial como Sir Alex Ferguson o Pep Guardiola han mostrado su descontento con este torneo. El efecto que ha provocado este torneo en Inglaterra se ha descontrolado entre marchas de los aficionados, reclamos de futbolistas y ex futbolistas, hasta el juicio de diversos medios nacionales e internacionales.\n\nSe ha ido desarmando el proyecto. Equipos que formaban parte de este selecto grupo como el Chelsea y el Manchester City, decidieron abandonar el certamen. Previo al partido del Chelsea ante el Brighton, los aficionados se presentaron en Stamford Bridge para celebrar el abandono de dicho certamen.\n\nReportes de Talksport aseguran que la cancelación será cuestión de tiempo y es por eso que Ed Woodward, actual CEO del Manchester United, habría presentado su renuncia para finales del 2021 ante el inminente final de esta liga que aún no ha dado inicio. Se ha planteado la posibilidad de que los presidentes de los clubes involucrados en la creación de la Superliga Europea sostendrán una reunión para analizar la cancelación del certamen que se anunció hace algunos días.\n\nPodrían ser días claves para el futbol europeo, pues el movimiento creado por aficionados y algunos equipos, ha dado frutos para que se mantenga el formato ya conocido por los seguidores de la Champions League y de las respectivas ligas que se involucraron. El futuro de esta liga sigue siendo desconocido, pues con todo el conflicto que se ha provocado, algún extremo tendrá que ceder para aceptar los términos necesarios y seguir velando por el desarrollo futbolístico y no solamente el económico."}

Even if I graduated and became a police officer, or doctor, or soldier, or whatever, I still wouldn't be what I am in my dreams.\n\nThere I've saved the world dozens of times. There I meet pretty girls and have sex with them. I can fly, have super speed and super strength. Bullets don't hurt me and everyone loves me.\n\nMy grades were suffering and I know my parents were worried about me. I seemed distant and didn't really go out with friends like I used to. I wanted to care about this world, I really did, but how could I when the other one was so amazing?\n\nWhy would I want to be here? How do I even really know this is the real world? What if my sidekick Wonderboy can't handle all the hero duties alone?

After the car crash that took her legs, we'd both embraced Digital Immortality. The concept seemed perfect then—she would always be present, and I would forever be there for her.\n\nEight years have passed. Four moves, two evictions, the selling of nearly everything we owned, and now this—the final breaking point. Each morning, I'd power up the computer, and she'd immediately share the amusing moments from my hours asleep. She knew how much I cherished her voice, but she also understood our financial reality.\n\n\"Just unplug it, for God's sake, Brian,\" she pleaded, desperation threading through her voice. I inhaled sharply, my fist connecting with the desk.\n\n\"Don't **ever** say that again,\" I snapped, anger washing over me like a tide.\n\nThat evening, after my shift, I finally allowed myself to rest. Four jobs in one day had left me drained, and the paperwork felt insurmountable. Outside, I activated my phone. She filtered through to the camera, watching. I scattered the paperwork across the ground and set it alight, observing as the fragments and sparks pirouetted in the air like exhausted fireflies.\n\n\"Why?\" she questioned softly.\n\n\"Because I can't sustain this anymore,\" I replied, my voice heavy with sadness. The £600 monthly payment had become an impossible burden. I turned to her then, and we talked for hours. We revisited every memory—from our first meeting on that school trip to my clumsy tumble into the lake. *Everything*.\n\n\"Why—why this walk down memory lane?\" she asked.\n\n\"Because I need to know you died happy,\" I whispered, tears breaking free as the words escaped.\n\nThe shock hit her deeply.\n\n\"I.... Please...\" she begged, but I was already dialing.\n\n\"Hello, Future Industries. How may we assist you?\" chirped the voice on the other end.\n\n\"No!\" she cried, her voice crackling through the speakers.\n\n\"I'd like to cancel my account,\" I managed through cold tears.\n\nKeys clicked in the background while she continued her desperate pleas. Finally, I stood, gripped my phone, and hurled it against the garden tree. In that instant, she shattered."}

Even looming exams pale in comparison to this emotional rollercoaster. There's nothing quite like riding the wave of having feelings for someone. Will senpai notice me? That's more of a joke than anything because we're already best friends.\n\nI can hear what you're thinking: \"Ah, the dreaded friend zone.\" But it's not what you might expect. You see, I placed myself there deliberately, knowing it was the only path to her heart. She's different from other girls—and before you roll your eyes at that cliché, let me explain. She's hesitant around guys. \"Hesitant\" might not be the right word, and honestly, I can only guess at what's going on in her mind.\n\nShe used to embrace solitude, claiming she didn't want to date anyone. But that's changed. Now she tells me about boys she finds attractive: \"He looked like he came down from heaven,\" she'll say. Being one of her few close friends—and male at that—I'm privy to conversations most guys would rather avoid. But I consider it an acceptable trade-off.\n\nThe complications arise from her shyness—she'd never make the first move. I'm similarly reserved, so I can't fault her for that. She's also adamant about not dating within our friend group, having witnessed how a recent breakup fractured our social circle over the summer.\n\nHere's where I might seem unusual: physical intimacy isn't my primary concern. Perhaps that makes me different from \"other guys,\" though that feels like another cliché. While I cherish the idea of cuddling and kissing, the more intimate aspects don't preoccupy my thoughts. I suspect she shares similar sentiments.\n\nThe plot thickens: I've already confessed—sort of. When she figured out my feelings over the summer, things became awkward. I messaged her (yes, I know that was cowardly) expressing my feelings while emphasizing our friendship's importance. She wanted to remain friends and apologized for the awkwardness."}

His head felt like someone had pierced it with their pitchfork and there was a crust of something gold and sticky smeared across his left hindquarter. It hadn't been a good night.\n\nHe gazed blearily around him. His legs were stretched out over the tattered remains of what had once been a very nice couch (maybe one of the ones that had come down with Ghengis Khan?) which had since fallen heavily from grace and now resided in a dingy apartment in southwest third circle, Hell. Through the window he could make out the harsh neon light of the sign from the brothel next door, Kingdom Cum.\n\nHe stood up and winced as his torn-up hooves met the flaming floor.\n\n\"Yo Beez, you up?\"\n\nIt was his sometimes-girlfriend, Lucy Furr. Lucy was a part-time dancer at the KC next door, and she definitely looked the part -- smooth humanoid curves and long muscular legs all covered in a fine layer of black peach fuzz. Ravishing. Today, she had big lumps of black sheep wool wrapped around each of her four calves.\n\n\"What the heaven is that?\" Beezlebub scoffed, gesturing at her footwear. \"You look like a cancerous donkey.\"\n\nShe walked in and threw a balled-up hamburger wrapper at him.\n\n\"They're called leg-warmers, dipshit.\"\n\nShe paused and studied his face intently.\n\n\"It's a human thing,\" she said softly.\n\nHe froze. \"You went up? How? When? Where?\"\n\nNo demon had gained access to the human world since years earlier when a few had climbed through the hole left after Hiroshima.\n\nLucy nodded. \"There's a small cavern we found in a place called San Francisco. Apparently there's a lot of gay people there so some Christians have been building a little passageway down here to try to get rid of them.\"\n\nBeezlebub blinked. \"But why the fuck would we care...\"\n\nLucy shrugged impatiently. \"Who knows?

{"text": "Here's a restructured version of the text with improved logical flow:\n\n**Introduction and Background**\nIn kinematics, robotics, and mechanism science, Hamiltonian quaternions and dual quaternions have been employed to parametrize the group of Euclidean displacements SE(3) as well as its subgroups SO(3) and SE(2). The rich algebraic structure of the quaternion models allows investigation of certain problems from an algebraic perspective. Rational motions can be represented by polynomials over the ring of quaternions or dual quaternions.\n\n**Context and Significance**\nIn this context, factorization of a polynomial into polynomials of lower degree corresponds to the decomposition of a rational motion into \"simpler\" motions. One of the simplest non-trivial motions are rotations, which can be represented by linear polynomials. Linear polynomials generically represent rotational motions. Hence, a motion described by a polynomial that admits a factorization into linear factors can be realized by a mechanism whose revolute joints correspond to the linear factors.\n\n**Split Quaternions and Previous Work**\nA suitable model for motions in the hyperbolic plane is provided by the noncommutative ring of split quaternions. Unlike Hamiltonian quaternions, the presence of zero divisors makes the factorization theory of polynomials over split quaternions more complex. Previous research has examined factorization of quadratic split quaternion polynomials and zeros of higher-degree split quaternion polynomials. Based on motion factorization theory using quaternions and dual quaternions, researchers have developed characterizations of factorizability and adapted algorithms from the Euclidean setup.\n\n**Current Research Focus**\nIn this article, we consider rational motions in the hyperbolic plane, represented by polynomials over split quaternions. We extend previous results from the quadratic case to polynomials of arbitrary degree, with a focus on geometric interpretation of factorizability. We investigate the \"geometry\" of the factorization algorithm for generic cases and modify it to provably find all factorizations into linear factors, including special cases with infinite or zero factorizations.\n\n**Methodology and Applications**\nFor split quaternion polynomials without linear factor factorizations, we adopt a \"degree elevation technique\" from the Euclidean setup. Multiplying with a suitable real polynomial allows decomposition into linear factors without changing the underlying rational motion, enabling decomposition into hyperbolic rotations. Our approach emphasizes geometric considerations over algebraic ones.\n\n**Additional Considerations**\nIt's worth noting that the set of split quaternions is isomorphic to the fundamental algebra of real 2 × 2 matrices, making our results directly transferable.\n\n**Article Structure**\nThe article proceeds as follows:\n- Section 2: Definition of split quaternions and hyperbolic motions"}

{"text": "Here's the polished version of the text:\n\n# Advances in Brain-Computer Interface Technology: A Review\n\nNeuroimaging technology has revolutionized our ability to visualize the human brain, offering unprecedented insights into both its structural and functional aspects. This advancement led to the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which leverage neuroimaging modalities like electroencephalography (EEG) to establish direct communication between the brain and computers. These systems have demonstrated remarkable applications, from cursor control[1-3] to wheelchair operation[4,5] and exoskeleton manipulation[6-8].\n\nThree primary neurological signals drive BCI commands: P300 oddball stimulus, steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP), and motor-related somatosensory rhythms. While SSVEP and P300-based BCIs offer the advantage of brief training periods and have shown promising results, they require external stimulation. In contrast, motor-related brain rhythms, generated through motor imagery (MI) or motor planning, involve the mental simulation of motor tasks without actual muscle activation[9]. Research has shown that MI can produce movement-related cortical potential similar to actual muscle movement, without requiring external stimuli[10]. Scientists have employed various EEG features to detect motor-related brain activities, including:\n\n- Event-related desynchronization[11]\n- Beta rebound[12,13]\n- Empirical mode decomposition[14]\n- Filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP)[15]\n- Functional connectivity (FC)[16]\n\nDespite significant advances in BCI research enabling most users to effectively operate these systems, challenges remain. Even after extensive training, a substantial portion of the population struggles to successfully operate one or more types of BCI systems[17]. Studies estimate that approximately 15-30% of individuals cannot generate brain signals suitable for translation into BCI commands[18]. Furthermore, conventional BCIs focus solely on decoding implicit brain signals without considering the environmental context in which they operate."}
